A diagonal line follows the diminishing figures, from the looming body of the good thief at the extreme left edge, to Christ hanging on the cross in the center, to the bad thief at the right, and finally down toward Jerusalem, lightly sketched in the distance. A tumultuous group of figures and horses crowds around the feet of Jesus at the left, with rearing horses, the Virgin weeping, and Saint John pointing at himself; but the top left of the composition remains open. With such techniques, Hans von Aachen created an effect of dramatic spaciousness.Von Aachen probably made this large and impressive drawing as a preliminary study for a painting. He first sketched the composition extensively in black chalk, which is particularly visible in the torso and hand of the thief in the upper left corner and in the city of Jerusalem in the lower right. Next he laid in the figure groups in graywash, making extensive use of the white paper for highlights; finally, he worked over the entire composition, defining elements with relatively sparing touches of pen and brown ink.
Designed for writing, this elaborately decorated table includes two drawers at the back and a pull-out writing surface backed with three small drawers. The top is inlaid withmarquetryscenes ofclassicalgods copied fromantiquesarcophagi. FavoriteNeoclassicalmotifssuch aspalmettes,medallions, masks, and acanthus leaves adorn the table's border, sides, and the tops of the legs. The legs of the table inventively display male nudes as if they were three-dimensional, with each side showing a figure from a different angle.
Late in his life, Eugne Atget made many photographs in a public park that overlooked the river Seine on the outskirts of Paris. The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal chteau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones. Berenice Abbott, a young American photographer who befriended Atget and purchased many of his prints and negatives after his death, made this print some fifteen years later.
As Berenice Abbott made this picture of a once-famous Greenwich Village eatery, a lone man taking an early morning walk or perhaps going to work paused in front of the four-story structure. While the restaurant's grand facade remains imposing, the stained pillars and bricks and crumpled awning inform pedestrians and potential customers that the establishment is not as impressive as it had originally been.
Oblivious to Berenice Abbott's camera, pedestrians at Union Square in New York City were photographed mid-stride on an especially sunny and warm day. Union Square has long been a center of commercial activity, as well as a busy intersection where people catch one of the many subway or bus lines that run along Lexington Avenue, Columbus or Broadway. While recording the intersection, Abbot also documented the area's prominent billboards and businesses.Abbott's intention when making this photograph was not simply to record a place, but to convey the vitality of New York. Her work during this period parallels that of Walker Evans, who often photographed New York's hurrying pedestrians, advertisements, and varieties of architecture as evidence of popular culture.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s Robert Adams explored new housing tracts that were being built along the Colorado Front Range. Certain elements of this new landscape recur in his photographs: uniform, boxy houses, concrete, cars, and dirt plots--as well as a sense of loneliness and isolation.  People had moved to enjoy nature, but found that nature was mostly inaccessible except on weekends,  Adams wrote.  Often little of it was even visible out the window. The puzzle became how to live inside. 
When Robert Adams returned to Colorado in the late 1960s after attending college in California, he found it being transformed by some of the same kinds of development he had seen in the Los Angeles area. He began to record these changes with his camera. This picture of Colfax Avenue, extending west through a suburb of Denver, is testimony to both the brutal dominance of the automobile and the imperishable beauty of light.
One day in the winter of 1973 Robert Adams was drawn to a plume of smoke he saw in the distance as he drove north from Denver. The deep black of the noxious cloud and its graceful billowing provided an unexpected beauty against the snow-covered landscape. Adams deepened this contrast by including the front range of the Colorado Rockies in the distance and the oil derrick only yards from a stately tree.
Robert Adams focused his camera on a whimsical collection of trees at the edge of a canyon. Each tree--or fragment of one--appears to express a distinct personality, from the scrubby palm on the left to the gawky trunk of a pine in the center to a feathery branch of eucalyptus on the right. An ominous blanket of smog, which obscures the mountains in the distance, enables the foliage to stand out.
Here Adams presents a landscape of unconventional beauty: a quarried mesa scarred with a serpentine network of tire tracks. Focusing on spaces that are not typically revered for their splendor--but where many people live and work--Adams draws attention to the dignity of the ordinary landscape and the effects of human incursions on it. His photographs and writing encourage responsible stewardship of the environment as a whole, not just those areas set aside for preservation in national parks.
A young mother walks with her son beneath the arches of a large, suburban shopping center on the west edge of Denver, Colorado. Another woman heads to the parking lot, carrying a large sack. This is one of many photographs Robert Adams made of people living downwind from the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant. For this series, he covertly made candid portraits of individuals he felt represented  a kind of heroism in just negotiating malls and city streets. 
Even at first glance, the burnt pine tree in theforegroundof this image offers a grim message about the environmental state of an area where Robert Adams once lived. Beyond the community of Lyons, Colorado, which you can see in thebackground, large housing developments were being built not far from the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant. Adams visually expressed his deep concern for the region by deliberately tilting the horizon.
Two dead palm trees form an X against a hazy sky in Robert Adams's view of a vacant lot east of Los Angeles. The trees were being uprooted to make way for development. As Adams went about making this photograph, he faced not only the harsh terrain but the hostility of neighbors. Despite such challenges, Adams often sees beauty in such places. This iconic image seems to underscore his philosophy:  the better the picture, the more disparate things are reconciled. 
Through photography, Robert Adams seeks to find and express meaning in life by examining the landscapes near where he has lived. Often, he deliberately confronts damaged environments and challenges himself to find beauty in them. In this case, though, Adams expresses the serenity of a perfect moment: a night sky filled with stars and the silhouette of a leafy treetop.
Viewed frontally, this sculpture appears to be composed of a single sheet of highly-polished steel curling gently upward at its base. But viewed off-center, a second sheet of steel is revealed--as is the meaning of the work's title. At their bottom edges, these essentially identical forms almost meet; but at their top edges, they tilt away from one another. Although this large, vertical form is not unimposing, its gleaming surface subtly reflects its surroundings, allowing the sculpture to exist harmoniously in nature.In the last decade of his career, Robert Adams largely concentrated on relatively small pieces in bronze. This stainless steel form is one of his final large-scale sculptures. A careful and conscientious craftsman, Adams created numerous detailed drawings and elevations to work out the form. These documents, along with small models, would serve as a guide for the fabricator.Twowas cast in an edition of three.
John Adamson made this photograph out-of-doors because he needed bright sunlight to produce the exposure. This makeshift studio accounts for the casual backdrop visible behind the sitter. The woman's darkened eyes result from the sun's position overhead, which casts a deep shadow from her brow. She reads with her arm propped on the table, firmly but elegantly supporting her head to keep it from moving during the long exposure. The book and flowers on the table, common props of the photographic portrait in the nineteenth century, add a pictorial element to thecomposition. Her literacy and the academic setting--St. Andrews, the seat of Scotland's oldest university--indicate that Miss Isabella Thompson, the daughter of a physician and neighbor of Adamson, was very likely an educated woman.
As the first of his twelve Labors, the Greek heroHerakleshad to slay theNemean Lion, a monstrous beast with an impenetrable hide that was ravaging the countryside around the city of Nemea. Since weapons were of no use against the creature, Herakles' only option was to strangle it. Herakles battling the Nemean Lion was the most frequently depicted mythological scene in Greek art. In early depictions, Herakles stands facing the lion, but by the late 500s B.C., the combatants were depicted down on the ground, stretched out in opposite directions.On this Athenianred-figurekalpis, a tree bends over Herakles and the lion, a rare example of landscape elements in Greek art. Throughout theArchaicperiod and into the earlyClassical, vase-painters focused so completely on the figures in theirnarrativescenes that they excluded almost all background elements. Scenes played out in a sort of visual vacuum without any setting at all. On this vase, for example, the tree serves only as a marker to indicate that the action takes place outdoors.The kalpis is the rounded form of ahydria, or water vessel, favored by red-figure artists in this period. The three handles of the shape facilitated pouring and lifting.
Dancers in stylized poses form the decoration on both sides of this Athenianblack-figureamphora. On the front, two nude men dance between two clothed onlookers; on the back, three nude men appear to dance around a fourth clothed man. As was typical in the work of the Affecter, the figures, both dancers and observers, gesticulate strongly, but there is little meaning in their gestures. For all the apparent activity, the figures are quite passive. The Affecter put so little emphasis on thenarrativecontent of his work that scholars often have difficulty determining precisely what is being depicted. For example, some scholars interpret the figures on the back of the vase as dancing, while others see a scene of courtship. Nonetheless, all the figures are beautifully drawn with dramatic silhouettes emphasized by long angular limbs. This vase stands outside the normal stylistic trends for Athens and was probably designed for export to Etruria. TheEtruscansimported large quantities of Greek vases, and certain Athenian artists appear to have focused on this market, adapting their product to Etruscan taste.
Waving his club threateningly, the Greek hero Herakles pursues a centaur, a mythological part-horse, part-human creature, on the front of this Athenian black-figure amphora. On the back of the vase, Theseus battles the Minotaur. The Affecter depicted the two great heroes of the Greeks, Herakles and Theseus, battling monsters, symbolic victories of Greek civilization over the barbarians, yet he did not appear very interested in the stories. For example, in Greek mythology, Herakles battles two centaurs, Pholos and Nessos.The depiction on this vase is quite unusual for Athenian pottery of the time, because the Affecter did not provide the clues that would identify which encounter was represented here. It is, however, quite typical for the Affecter, who focused primarily on the decorative aspects of figures. His unusual approach to potting is also evident on this vase, where he threw an old-fashioned neck-amphora form but modified it by adding a raised ring to separate the neck from the body. The oddness of the Affecter's style may be explained by the fact that he appears to have been creating vases for export to Etruria. He created products to suit Etruscan rather than Greek taste.
By the early 400s B.C., professional teachers had established schools in Athens. These teachers, who specialized in various aspects of education, provided training for the male children of parents who could afford to pay the tuition. The most basic education in one of these schools would have involved reading and writing and perhaps arithmetic. At about the same time, scenes of youths at school learning their lessons began to appear on Athenian vases, part of a growing interest on the part of vase-painters in depicting scenes of daily life.This smallred-figurecup fragment shows a boy holding a scroll while another person, perhaps his teacher, stands in front of him. Scholars have disagreed over what the scroll says. Some read it as the beginning of a list of mythological figures. Others see it as a fragment from an epic poem by Hesiod,  The Catalog of Women.  The latter interpretation may be more accurate since all other scrolls in school scenes contain epic poetry. Schoolboys were made to memorize the works of great poets, especiallyHomer, as moral instruction.This school scene comes from the interior of the cup. On the exterior, only the feet of two young men remain.
Clad in complementary yellow and blue, a young man and woman coyly eye each other, their hands meeting at the very center of the scene. Lively, overflowing foliage serves as a dramatic and fitting backdrop to this courtship. At the base of the plaque, an inscription in Latin that identifies the pair translates as: Behold the very beautiful Rachel with her sheep, whom Jacob chooses as his wife.Despite the inscription, the scene also includes several details from the biblical account of Rebecca and Eliezer at the well. The jar balanced on the well, the flamingolike camels in the background, and the jewel-laden chest in the foreground are elements of this story. The plaque is based on a mid-seventeenth century image of Rebecca and Eliezer by Jacopo Amigoni, whose paintings and engravings often served as a model for the decoration of plaques and tapestries. It is likely that the painter of the plaque had a print of Amigoni's work in hand but transformed it into the more amorous Jacob and Rachel subject, probably for a specific patron.
Lying on the ground with one arm outstretched, a beggar pleads for crumbs from a rich man's table while dogs lick his sores. This drawing is the second in a series of five preparatory studies Heinrich Aldegrever made for a set of engravings. The series illustrates the Biblical story of Dives and Lazarus from the Book of Luke. Lazarus, a pauper, lived outside the gates of Dives's afluent home. While Dives lived in luxury, Lazarus lived off the crumbs from his table. When the two died, Lazarus was taken to heaven, while Dives went to hell. Dives was punished for eternity because of his mistreatment of Lazarus on earth.Although the story takes place in the early Christian era, Aldegrever placed the figures in a fashionable interior of the 1500s. Artists often chose to use contemporary settings to make it easier for their viewers to identify with the characters. Dives's feast takes place in a sumptuous interior decorated with bottle glass windows. On the floor, glass vessels fill a wine cooler. Elaborately attired figures seated around the banquet table fail to show the beggar any charity. A servant carrying chafing dishes high above his head emphasizes that Dives's abundant food is unobtainable for Lazarus.
Befitting a young noblewoman, Maria Cerri Capranica is dressed in a velvet gown with an elaborate lace collar. Her elegant outfit is complemented by an array of jewelry--a long strand of pearls, a necklace set with precious stones, a pendant with a smallreliefof theHoly Family, and pearl drop earrings. The sitter was clearly a woman of status and affluence, and the sculptor depicted her with a powerful and distinctive psychological presence.The fine details of the sitter's costume, jewelry, and hairstyle display a true mastery of marble carving. Maria Cerri's intricate coiffure--amassof curls ornamented with loops of satiny ribbon--falls gracefully around her face. Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round. The attention given to her lace and jewelry makes this as much a portrait of her accessories as of the subject herself.Married in 1637, Maria Cerri and Bartolomeo Capranica were from prominent Roman families. Acoat of armsidentifying both families appears at the base of the sculpture. Maria Cerri died at the age of twenty-five in 1643.
Held up by a triton wearing a garland of seaweed at his waist, Cupid suckles at a woman's breast-probably that of Venus, the goddess born from the sea. Her scallop-shell chariot drawn by two dolphins is a common attribute, recalling her birth from the sea. In the background, Neptune, ruler of the sea, brandishes his trident and rides in a shell chariot drawn by two hippocamps (sea horses).In this drawing, Alessandro Algardi combined idealization of the human body derived from classical sculpture with convincing, realistic representation based on close observation of the human form. His energetic use of chalk imbued the scene with movement and caught the effect of light, particularly in his modeling of Venus's soft skin and the tritons' muscular flesh.Algardi most often made drawings in association with sculptural projects. As the master of the illusionistic pictorial relief during the Baroque era in Rome, he may have designed this arrangement of figures for a low-relief sculpture, possibly for execution in embossed metalwork. Either Algardi, an assistant, or a later artist pricked only the outlines of the main group for transfer to another surface. Only the main group may have been used, or the project may have been abandoned or altered on the right side.
Two contemporary Bolognese draftsmen worked at different times on this unique drawing. Sculptor Alessandro Algardi added the figures after painter Francesco Grimaldi had created the landscape. By inserting the Holy Family, which fits so naturally into the composition, the elder Algardi may have meant to improve his junior colleague's composition. The figural group balances the central tree and gives the landscape a recognizable subject matter. To achieve greaterluster, Algardi also may have added the brownwashthroughout.The artists' styles are distinctive. Algardi drew his playful family grouping with a more delicate, graceful, even fragile line than Grimaldi's bold squiggles and hatching, which are especially evident in the dynamic, dominant tree.These two artists often worked together on architectural commissions, yet only one other similar sheet exists, an architectural drawing in which Algardi corrected and added to Grimaldi's work. This drawing could have been made in preparation for Grimaldi's etching of the same subject.
Pluto, god of the Underworld, seizes Proserpine, daughter of the corn-goddess Ceres, ready to carry her down to his kingdom on a chariot drawn by black horses. Because Pluto allowed Proserpine to return to earth each spring for four months, the story recounted inOvid'sMetamorphosessymbolized seasonal death and rebirth.Yet, even this dire subject takes place in an enchanted setting. Characteristically, Alessandro Allori added playful touches: slender, graceful nymphs, possibly Proserpine's former companions, pick flowers and frolic while being observed by satyrs. The abrupt truncation of Pluto's chariot and horses at the bottom of the panel and the bright, saturated colors display frequent characteristics of FlorentineMannerism. Allori's complicated, twisted poses and his cool, smooth style reflect the influence of his adopted father and master Bronzino.Allori painted this panel, along with many others, as decoration for the Villa Salviati, a private home near Florence.
A procession of women and children descending marble stairs carry and wear brightly colored flowers. Cheering spectators fill the windows and roof of a classical building. Lawrence Alma Tadema here represented the Victorian custom of sending children into the country to collect flowers on the morning of May 1, or May Day, but placed the scene in ancient Rome. In this way, he suggested the festival's great antiquity through architectural details, dress, sculpture, and even the musical instruments based on Roman originals.Alma Tadema's curiosity about the ancient world was insatiable, and the knowledge he acquired was incorporated into over three hundred paintings of ancient archeological and architectural design. He said:Now if you want to know what those Greeks and Romans looked like, whom you make your masters in language and thought, come to me. For I can show not only what I think but what I know.Alma Tadema's paintings also enjoyed popularity later, when his large panoramic depictions of Greek and Roman life caught the attention of Hollywood. Certain scenes in Cecil B. De Mille's filmCleopatra(1934) were inspired by the paintingSpring.
This tranquil landscape with buildings in the distance is a symphony of varied lines enhanced by a delicate use ofwash. Denys van Alsloot's fragile line ranges from the elegant curves of the tree trunks to squiggles suggesting leaves to almost dotlike notations for the grasses in the marsh at the center. Alsloot, official painter to the Brussels court, often created imaginary scenes like this one, including castles andabbeysseen in the nearby forest of Soignes.A central clump of trees clearly divides the scene; at right, trees surround a path, and to the left a river meanders through rocks and mountains, stretching into a panoramic view. At least two of Alsloot's paintings show the same composition in mirror image.
A crowd of townsfolk gathers to watch Christ carry the cross to the hill of Golgotha, where he was crucified. Christ falls beneath the weight of the cross in the center of the scene, while a Roman soldier goads him on with the end of his pike and an elderly, bearded Simon tries to assist him.Albrecht Altdorfer conveyed the scene's drama by packing a monumental, relief-like concentration of figures into a tight space. The crowd presses forward onto the four central figures, wrapping around them and creating a claustrophobic effect. The bold vertical lines of the cross and the soldier's pike lead the viewer's eyes diagonally down to the main image of the kneeling Christ. Altdorfer displayed exceptionally varied line work, particularly in the figure of Christ. There he used strokes of gray wash to emphasize and soften the black ink outline, while in other areas he created shadows with the wash.Probably part of a series representing the Passion, this is Altdorfer's only surviving design for a stained-glass window.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph of a small mound of flowers and candles depicts one of many ways in which the dead are commemorated in Mexico. According to Mexican culture, life and death are recurring stages of a ceaseless cosmic process. Death is thus incorporated into everyday life. OnDa de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, people visit the cemetery where their relatives are buried; in addition to decorating gravesites with flowers and candles, they sit on picnic blankets next to the tombs and eat their loved ones' favorite foods. As if to underscore the transitory quality of earthbound things, Alvarez Bravo made this photograph when two of the lit candles were nearly extinguished.
Using clasps meant to attach stockings to a garter, Manuel Alvarez Bravo affixed a scientific drawing of a male torso in profile to an advertisement for women's corsets, then photographed the collage. The resulting image emphasizes the similarities between the male skeletal structure and the external binding devices used to support the female form. In comparing the natural and the artificial, the collage probes what lies beneath the surface of both skin and clothing.
This horse's skeleton, with its front legs missing, appears to belong to the prehistoric world rather than to the modern. Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph speaks of death and decay, topics often associated with Mexico's experience after the Spanish conquest. The title,Ruin (B), links the horse's remains to relics found at Mayan and Aztec archeological sites, where temples were left to crumble after the defeat of the native population. The horse is not native to Mexico, but was introduced by the Spanish. Alvarez Bravo's image of the dead horse--a vanquished remnant of colonial power--illustrates a symbolic victory over the Spanish.
This sculpture of Christ enduring the agony of the forty lashes calls to mind the violent religious upheaval that took place during Mexico's forced conversion to Christianity in the 1500s. Manuel Alvarez Bravo discovered this Catholic altar inside a church in Xochimilco, south of Mexico City. In capturing the poignancy of the flowers hanging from between the fingers of the tortured Christ, Alvarez Bravo's image alludes to the complex history of Mexican Catholicism, whose teachings have for centuries been blended with indigenous beliefs.
The images of ruin and decay that Manuel Alvarez Bravo made in the 1930s reflect his experience of reaching adulthood during the Mexican Revolution. In this composition, what once may have been the entrance to a large building looms large in the foreground. The corroded structure evokes the architectural ruins of Mexico's formerly great civilizations--ballcourts, temples, and palatial compounds that served as settings for dramatic rituals. Perhaps Alvarez Bravo was considering this when he named the imageRuin (A), an ambiguous title typical of the ones archaeologists use to demarcate sites.
In this image by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, a crown of thorns and a branch of delicate flowers lie on the ground in an arrangement that clearly alludes to Christianity. Alvarez Bravo made this photograph while documenting pre-Hispanic mural paintings and trying to determine whether photography could represent historic events with any degree of accuracy.The title,Historic Plot, illustrates Alvarez Bravo's fondness for wordplay. Plot may denote a parcel of land or a deceitful scheme. Was the artist alluding to Mexico's ancient civilizations or to an entrenched conspiracy  The use of Christian imagery indicates that Alvarez Bravo was referring to the forced conversion of Mexico's native population after the arrival of missionaries in the 1500s.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph of a burro grazing beneath a cross-section of a wooden post makes direct reference to Christianity. This image was made in a small village, amid the comings and goings of the local residents. Alvarez Bravo's sense of humor is at play in this seemingly ordinary scene. The burro, a creature noted for its stubbornness and stupidity, finds nourishment at the foot of the cross, while the villagers appear to turn their backs on it, and on salvation.
In this photograph of a man leading two horses in a semicircle over sun-bleached straw, Manuel Alvarez Bravo depicts a subject that for many Mexicans evokes thoughts of the Spanish conquest. Until the Spaniards' arrival, the horse was unknown in Mexico, and it remained alien to that culture for many years. When the Aztec people saw a horse for the first time, they mistook the formidable animal and its rider for one single being. Alluding perhaps to this historical encouter, Alvarez Bravo's image merges the bodies of horse and man, as the larger horse obscures the workingman's head.
Standing in the shade of a rural building, Manuel Alvarez Bravo made this photograph of a sun-drenched sapling, newly planted in the dry earth. A carefully crafted trellis of bamboo and twine protects the frail plant, indicating that it is of considerable importance to its owner. By omitting actors from the scene, Alvarez Bravo's image reveals a ground-level universe, rich in devotional meaning.
Much of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's work investigates the natural world and the ways in which it served Mexico's native population. In this image, neatly cultivated rows of saplings emerge from the dry, crumbly earth. For centuries this land has provided Mexicans with the corn that is integral to their sustenance. The tattered piece of cloth hanging from a twig-like branch--referred to as a  little flag  by Alvarez Bravo--serves as a scarecrow in a recently planted field. The stick-and-rag scarecrow may be seen as a stand-in for the photographer himself in this otherwise empty landscape.
Paul Strand eloquently described Manuel Alvarez Bravo's work as  rooted firmly in his love and compassionate understanding of his own country, its people, their problems and their needs.  For Strand, Alvarez Bravo had mastered the medium of photography and used it  to speak with warmth about Mexico. Like many of Alvarez Bravo's photographs, this image illustrates the day-to-day struggle--and resourcefulness--of Mexico's poor. The ramshackle setting is the residence and workplace of a scrap collector, who has assembled a collection of artifacts in the hopes of attracting a potential buyer. Alvarez Bravo's title,Fable of the Dog and the Cloud, draws attention to the only two elements in the image that are capable of movement, implying that the collector's stagnant goods will remain unsold.
Photographed at close range, a stack of books is transformed into a geometric study of shape and mass, light and shadow. Manuel Alvarez Bravo selected works from his own library for this composition, which suggests a towering form of modern architecture. At the bottom of the stack is Maurice Raynal's 1922 monograph on Picasso, a foundational text that greatly influenced Alvarez Bravo. Picasso's work encouraged the artist to experiment with abstract and cubist compositions. The viewer can only speculate about the contents of the books stacked on top of the monograph, but it is likely that these volumes were equally important to Alvarez Bravo's development as a photographer.This formal, abstract image indicates that, by 1930, Alvarez Bravo had absorbed many contemporary modernist ideas, even though he lived in Mexico City, far from the main centers of avant-garde artistic production. Because of his location, Alvarez Bravo depended largely on printed words and images as sources of inspiration.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser
This photograph of an optician's shop and oval hanging sign, taken from the perspective of a pedestrian looking up, plays a trick on the viewer. By flipping the negative and producing reversed text, Manuel Alvarez Bravo called into question the accuracy of vision. Images of the human eye reiterate the theme of looking.Although the nameLa Optica Modernameans  the modern optician's shop,  Alvarez Bravo recognized that these words imply  the modern viewpoint.  The photograph's title,Parabola optica, compounds this wordplay.Parabolaboth suggests the shape of something and alludes to parable, a story with multiple meanings. Alvarez Bravo thus crafted a modern parable about the shapes we see and the meanings we attach to them.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo photographed this statue, possibly meant to symbolize a muse, in the vicinity of Mexico City's Palace of Fine Arts. Inexplicably draped with burlap sacks, the figure appears to gaze at an object outside the photograph's boundary. Alvarez Bravo captured this timeless image as the sun's rays bore down on the solid stone and the pliable burlap, accentuating their textures in subtle shades of gray.
Dreams are a frightening and dangerous state during which the dreamer is most vulnerable. Dreaming is an escape into a different world, into the unknown.This statement, by a historian who interviewed Manuel Alvarez Bravo, relays some of the ideas the artist may have considered while making this wistful portrait of young girl standing on a balcony with the sunlight innocently caressing her right shoulder. Perhaps Alvarez Bravo was trying to guess the girl's thoughts, as she stood immersed in her reverie, clearly unaware of his presence and indeed vulnerable to his camera. The dream world was of great importance to the Surrealists, whose work influenced Alvarez Bravo. Many of his early images explore the themes of sleep, dreams, and eroticism.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo made this portrait of Rufino Tamayo's delicate hands to symbolize individuality within the larger fields of society and art. Tamayo, a mural painter, saw Alvarez Bravo's work in a 1928 exhibition. It was the first time Alvarez Bravo exhibited his photographs. Interested in reactions, he stood nearby hoping to eavesdrop on a conversation. Two people stood talking, then approached Alvarez Bravo. One of the individuals was Tamayo. He was the first artist to respond to Alvarez Bravo's work, and the two shared a close friendship from that moment forward.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser
Seated under the arch of a deteriorating cemetery wall, this group of women and children waits to honor their deceased relatives by visiting their graves. Death, as viewed by Mexico's indigenous people, is a continuation of life, a time when one becomes truly awake. The eroding wall and barren tree branches nonetheless convey an atmosphere of foreboding. Manuel Alvarez Bravo's image is not about the celebrations that are held for the dead, but about the longing that accompanies the passage from life to death.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo often used young women to represent abstract qualities such as virtue and vice. In this image, a young girl stands with her arms raised amid tobacco leaves that have been hung to dry under a cabana's thatched roof. The image's title,The Labyrinth Deciphered (The Vice), discloses an unacknowledged moral failure, namely, society's exploitation of child labor. While the double exposure conveys the idea of repetitive movement, the girl's upward sweeping gesture suggests a desire for deliverance from an injust fate.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo often chose the Mexican landscape to depict the way people made use of national symbols. In this image, the maguey plant, an icon of strength and perseverance, serves as an improvised rack for drying linens. The title,The Washerwomen Implied, alludes to the absent figures who have hung the bedclothes. Though this photograph seeems to document the cultural decline of the maguey, it celebrates the ingenuity of those who find their resources in what is simply available.
Scavenging for food in the ruins of a hacienda, the emaciated dog in Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph shows indifference to the decaying environs. In Mexican mythology, dogs are associated with Xolotl, the canine-headed god who accompanies souls in their journey to the Beyond. The two mangled tree trunks, which lend the scene a gloomy mood, underscore this otherworldly association.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph of a sheep lying dead in the road directly invokes Christian iconography, which often depicts Jesus as the lamb of God, sacrificed for the sins of mankind. The image reflects Alvarez Bravo's deep roots in a hybrid Mexican culture that fuses Spanish Catholicism with ancient Mexican mythology. This photograph was exhibited alongside the work of Marcel Duchamp, Frida Kahlo, Pablo Picasso, and Man Ray in the 1940 International Exhibition ofSurrealismheld in Mexico City.
Emulating the pose of a Flamenco dancer, this woman dramatically turns her head sideways and upwards, while extending one arm high up in the air. Holding a black, sheer cloth over her face and shielding her eyes from the strong Mexican sun, she enacts Manuel Alvarez Bravo's conception of an eclipse.At the same time, light bounces off the hanging white sheets, saturating the off-center areas of the photograph.Alvarez Bravo made many images of linens and clotheslines, exploring the interplay between draped fabric and angular architecture. Here, the addition of a figure, seemingly engaged in a performance, adds mystery and animation to an otherwise formal study.
As the generation of leaves, so is that of men.These words by the Greek poet Homer appeared beside this image in the catalog for the 1955Family of Manexhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The quote reminds viewers that in death and burial man reaches the end of a cycle, much like leaves at the end of a season. For the Mexican people, however, death marks not an ending but a perpetual cycle of renewal. In Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph, the rural artifact and miniscule daisy plant adorning a gravesite affirm the infinite resourcefulness of the human spirit.
In the 1930s Manuel Alvarez Bravo traveled throughout the Mexican countryside, making images that expressed the people's despondent feelings in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution. In this photograph, a desiccated wreath crowns a grave and its crucifix, suggesting loss and the passage of time. At the same time, vigorous weeds shooting up from the soil challenge the forces of death and decay. For Alvarez Bravo, these symbols captured the feelings of defeat and determination that Mexicans felt at a time of momentous national struggle.
With her back to the camera, a girl in a bright white cotton skirt peers into a circular black hole or window cut into a patterned wall with peeling paint. Her head is all but obscured by a wide-brimmed hat that echoes the shape of the portal. She stands on her toes ever so tentatively, her bare right foot overlapping her left as if she is trying to create her own stepping stair. Her right hand disappears into the void as she investigates the unseen contents within. This photograph by Manuel Alvarez Bravo establishes a contrast between her innocence and the fearful unknown.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo portrayed Isabel Villaseor, an icon of   Mexico's postrevolutionary period, with one foot propped on a step and her head turned up in regal fashion, while a woman combs her long tresses. The striking features of Villaseor, who was an artist, poet, and songwriter, were idealized as symbols of Mexican feminine intellect and beauty.In his title,Woman of the Isthmus Combing Isabel's Hair, Alvarez Bravo acknowledged the indigenous woman from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec whose dark features are so different from Villaseor's, though no less striking. This image is part of an artistic tradition illustrating women's grooming activities.
Seated with their arms crossed, a man and a woman sell their wares, shaded by a striped shawl that has been tied to two trees. Manuel Alvarez Bravo made this photograph outside the Villa de Guadalupe, a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's quintessential religious figure. Much of Mexico's rural population began moving to the capital around the time that Alvarez Bravo made this image. Their hardship and the disparity between the social classes became highly visible among Mexico's citizens, and in Alvarez Bravo's work.Alvarez Bravo used visual clues to illustrate the couple's social plight. By relegating the figures to the extreme lower foreground and filling the remainder of the composition with tree trunks and branches, Alvarez Bravo illustrated their lowly status. To symbolize the almost impossible task of improving one's circumstances, he cropped the couple's feet out of the photograph. At the same time, a beam of light falls across the left side of the image and onto the woman's figure, as if to signal that a better future may be forthcoming.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo made this startling photograph of a murdered union leader after following the sound of what he thought were fireworks. Instead, he arrived upon the scene of a sugar-mill labor strike, where shots were being fired. With two frames left in his camera, Alvarez Bravo moved in close and framed his subject so that the the top border of the photograph would press against the victim's body, as if it were the lid of a coffin. A trail of blood spills into the image's lower right corner.Without denying his handsome features or dignity, Alvarez Bravo portrayed the felled worker neither as a hero nor as a martyr, but simply as a sacrifice. As one historian has observed:  The offering of human lives in ancient Mexico was natural; [the worker's] death is no more than a ritual sacrifice to the gods of society, a mere necessity for the well-being of the Mexican people 
With their backs to the camera and their faces hidden in the shadows of a partly rolled-up metal curtain, these anonymous workers sit at a lunch counter during a brief respite from work. Shoeshine boxes and paint-splattered overalls reveal the hard manual labor they are engaged in. The stools, chained to each other and to the counter, suggest the constraints and limited opportunities of the laborer's world.The working class and its arduous toil were important issues to Manuel Alvarez Bravo, whose depiction of everyday subjects often made them appear extraordinary. His title for this photograph,The Crouched Ones, may seem odd, given that none of the figures is visibly crouched over. Alvarez Bravo viewed the act of crouching as a defense mechanism of Mexicans,  who can fold their body and soul into this humble position and still retain their pride and integrity. 
I do not know if you have been absent:I lie down with you, I rise up with you,In my dreams you are with me.If my teardrops tremble within my eyes,I know it is you moving my heart.Like this Aztec poem, the image of an isolated figure lying exposed and vulnerable on a city street evokes feelings of anguish, longing, and departure. Mexican mythology rests heavily upon ideas of death, considered a constant companion to every man, woman, and child. Manuel Alvarez Bravo explored this theme in his work as a mean of analyzing his own culture.The title,The Third Fall,alludes to the prayer Christians offer at the ninth Station of the Cross:  My Jesus, by all the bitter woes Thou didst endure when for the third time the heavy cross bowed Thee to the earth, never, I beseech Thee, let me fall again into sin.  Lying as if at the feet of the viewer, the faceless individual embodies the fall into misery that has plagued Mexico's people.
The expression on Isabel Villaseor's partially lit face reveals a moment of psychological complexity, when, gazing into her small mirror, she appears caught between vanity and insecurity. Artist, poet, singer, and songwriter, Villaseor was a remarkable personality and talent in post-revolutionary Mexico. Manuel Alvarez Bravo's image affords a voyeuristic view of a private moment. Though Villaseor remains modestly clothed, her long hair cascades around her, symbolizing intimacy and sexual assent.
Covered from head to toe, these fire fighters resemble characters from a science-fiction film. Manuel Alvarez Bravo captured them standing motionless in front of a decaying wall, perhaps observing a fire drill or waiting to relieve other workers. Their protective suede uniforms must have been a burden to wear beneath the rays of the hot Mexican sun. Concealed behind their masks, these individuals lack personal identity. Like many of Alvarez Bravo's images, this photograph uses concealment to introduce multiple layers of meaning.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser
Devoid of actors, this scene of an abandoned vessel crowned by palm branches suggests the aftermath of a ritual or ceremony. The carved canoe, which appears to have run aground on the wet sand of a riverbed, bears the weathered effects of its use. Manuel Alvarez Bravo's inscription of a possible alternate title,  Allegory of a Lost Victory,  implies an ambiguous triumph. Perhaps the artist was considering the arrival of the Spanish on the shores of Mexico and the subsequent fate of the Aztec people.
Driven by his desire to show  the tragic side of reality,  Manuel Alvarez Bravo photographed numerous rural burial sites. In this image the small wooden cross marking this mound as a freshly covered grave is barely visible behind the lush plant that fills the composition. A row of stacked stones in the background  points to a realm outside the picture's frame. The devotional practices of the Mexican people and the interplay of artifact and landscape are frequent themes in Alvarez Bravo's work.
Whether concealed by a fig leaf or locked by a chastity belt, a woman's erogenous area has traditionally been kept hidden from view. Flouting convention, Manuel Alvarez Bravo staged this scene by clothing the model's upper thighs, hips, and waist, and exposing her pubic region. Although this photograph challenges traditional representations of women, it alludes to confinement through the use of bandages around the model's wrists and ankles. These devices can be interpreted as symbols of bondage and lack of free will.In this seemingly serene setting, the star cacti lined up beside the slumbering model signal pain and danger. The plants impede the woman's free movement, while at the same time protecting her from the sexual advances of a potential intruder. In naming this photographThe Good Reputation,Sleeping, Alvarez Bravo drew upon the Mexican proverb: Earn a good reputation, then rest on your laurels.
Lying on her undone dress, this woman rests inches away from fragments of broken glass. With her left arm, she shields her eyes from the sun. The staged scene conveys a sense of tension and foreboding.Signals and Prognostications, Manuel Alvarez Bravo's somewhat bewildering title, implies that her disrobing and exposure occurred as the result of some inscrutable urge.In Surrealist art, it is more frequent than not to depict only a fragment of the body. Manuel Alvarez Bravo followed that principle when photographing this model's torso. This scene was part of a series of images Alvarez Bravo made the same day, featuring this model in various poses and states of undress.
With her back turned, this young woman prepares to disrobe amid shards of broken glass. Althoug the model remains fully clothed, Manuel Alvarez Bravo's staging invites the viewer to contemplate the form beneath the dress. Raising her arms to unclip her hair, she appears to be making a sexual overture. The proximity of her bare feet to the glass fragments suggests a potential threat. This photograph attests to Alvarez Bravo's ties to the Surrealists, for whom eroticism was always tinged with danger.
Visually inspired by the bandages that dancers use to wrap their legs before practicing, Manuel Alvarez Bravo wrapped his model's wrists, thighs, hips, and feet with dressings supplied by a physician friend. Juxtaposing her tender flesh and serene slumber with thorny cactus pears from the local market, Alvarez Bravo photographed the model, Alicia, on the roof of the national arts school where he taught. He created thistriptych, or series of three images, for the cover of an exhibition catalogue for a Surrealist exhibition that Andr Breton organized in Mexico City in 1939, using the multiple format for emphasis. Predictably, the prominent display of pubic hair standing out against the bandages drove censors to declare the work unacceptable for the cover.
Alvarez Bravo hired a young female model to pose for him while he was teaching photography at the Academia de San Carlos (Academy of San Carlos) in Mexico City in 1937. Over the course of the next few years he created a series of figure studies that are noteworthy for their simple yet powerful compositions. In this picture Alvarez Bravo positioned the young woman on a fabriccovered table against a plain white wall. He achieved a balance between divergent elements--stasis and dynamism, tension and relaxation, and positive and negative space.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo directed this model to pose with her head dramatically turned upward. The young girl's unnatural posture encouraged the presumably male viewer to gaze freely at her eroticized form; her averted face denied her the opportunity to return and confirm the gaze. This pose belongs to an academic tradition of representing women as objects of desire.Alvarez Bravo produced a series of nude photographs depicting this model. He called the seriesMorning Notebook, suggesting that the female body was a construction that could be documented and then read like words on a page. During this period, many Surrealist artists, whose work influenced Alvarez Bravo, used the female form in much the same way--for clearly visible consumption.
With one arm outstretched and the other holding her bandage in place, this young woman leans against the weathered wall of an unknown building. The scene is mysterious and perplexing. What is this strange arrangement of bandages  Was this woman injured  If so, why is she outdoors  Why is she topless In 1938 Manuel Alvarez Bravo made this photograph on the rooftop of the national arts school where he was teaching. The image, from the session ofGood Reputation 1 2 3,uses the same model. But instead of illustrating a sleepy eroticism, inUnbandaged #2she undresses, adjusts, and removes the bandages, actively engaging the viewer in a dance of seduction. Overtly sexual themes were central to the Surrealist movement, which greatly influenced Alvarez Bravo.
Photographed in Cuyutln on the Pacific coast of the state of Colima, this cross may have symbolized for Manuel Alvarez Bravo the arrival of the Spaniards, and of Christianity, in the 1500s. Alvarez Bravo called this imageSea of Tears, perhaps alluding to the many tears shed by the Aztecs as they saw their numbers decrease in the wake of European wars and diseases. The driftwood in the foreground suggests a writhing human form, collapsed as if in sorrow at the foot of a cross.
Cracked and patched in places, the skylight upon which this model reclines emphasizes her disjunctive pose. Unlike many of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's portraits that represent nude women as objects of desire, this image depicts a model sprawled upon a broken surface like a discarded doll. The jarring angle of Alvarez Bravo's lens heightens the awkwardness of the staged scene. Though she hasn't been treated very delicately by the photographer's lens, the title,Sparrow, Clearly, suggests she is as fragile as a small bird.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo's image of a worn adobe wall rendered against a cloud-filled sky is both dramatic and mysterious, provoking questions about its purpose and meaning. Whom or what is this barrier protecting  What lies on the other side  A strange mast-like, wooden assemblage protrudes from behind the wall into the sky but offers no clues. The wall is a boundary to the unknown, and the viewer is denied an answer to this enigmatic juxtaposition of forms and materials.
Part of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's career involved photographing murals, the visual evidence of Mexico's culture that was freely available for public viewing. In this image, he captured a different kind of scene--a view opened to the gaze of any passerby and newly made possible by the invention of the X-Ray machine. This assortment of X-Ray images illustrating the internal skeletal structure of the human body was mounted outside the laboratory storefront of a colonial building in downtown Mexico City. Linking radiography to photographic methods, this searching exploration of surface and anatomy, of the visible and the concealed, became a hallmark of Alvarez Bravo's work.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser
Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph of a long lock of wavy hair lying on a geometrically patterned floor juxtaposes texture and materials, dreams and taboos, and invokes questions about the drama taking place outside the photograph. Was this hair placed on the floor intentionally, or did it fall accidentally  The natural presumption is that the hair belonged to a woman, but could it have belonged to a man  Stripped of a luxurious mane, so symbolic of power and passion, is its one-time  owner  now weak and indifferent  This complex image has led one writer to assert that  in theme and form, the photograph is divided between the hint of seduction and that of punishment.

Any title is valid . . . It is a creation of the artist, and if it leads to a deeper understanding of the image, this makes it even more successful.In this statement, Manuel Alvarez Bravo may have been referring to his title for this image,Somewhat Gay and Graceful. Despite its ambiguous meaning, it hints at the personality of the woman whose awkwardly turned legs are shown retreating from the viewer. Alvarez Bravo achieved this jarring, flattened perspective by photographing from an oblique angle. Despite the title's reference to poise, everything in the image--the camisole laid out to dry, the griddle filled with tortilla strips, and the woman--appears transitory and unstable.
Caught mid-stride, two figures approach each other on an otherwise empty road. Carefully mincing her steps, the young woman carries a parcel; in Manuel Alvarez Bravo's eyes, she is making an offering. The young man, on the other hand, hurries along, propelled forward by his lengthy gait. Alvarez Bravo saw the man's movement as flight, as if he were hiding or running away. Above them, a different kind of movement stirs the clothelines, as laundry items saturated with midday sun blow in the breeze. Though their paths are about to cross, the lives of these two people may never connect. Alvarez Bravo's image captures the tension of encounters on city streets and illustrates the indifference that people express towards one another in urban environments.
Artists have traditionally depicted leisurely figures strolling through parks and along scenic promenades such as Paris streets, but here Manuel Alvarez Bravo shows a different kind of wanderer, one he calls a  pilgrim.  Walking along a gritty urban street, a solitary transient clutches a walking stick. His path is not embellished by rolling hills, trees, lakes, or streams; nor is it enhanced by cafes and boutiques. Dirt, concrete, corrugated tin, and rubbish mark the journey of thisPilgrim of the Things of This Life. His solemn expression and purposeful stride suggest that his may not be a pursuit for material reward so much as a quest for spiritual fulfillment.
Palm leaves, flowers, ribbons, and paper ornaments decorate this roadside shrine in Chalma, a pilgrimage site not far from Mexico City. Like many of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs, this image explores the devotional aspect of Mexico's daily life.Since the 1500s pilgrims have been visiting Chalma, where a miracle is believed to have taken place. Christian missionaries, eager to convert the indigenous people, persuaded them to renounce their worship of Otzocteotl, a deity to whom they offered prayers and sacrifices. The miracle occurred when the venerated statue was found shattered and in its place rose a crucified figure. Though nearly five hundred years have passed, Christians still make pilgrimages to the site. In illustrating how the pilgrims mark their route, Alvarez Bravo's photograph reveals the rustic accoutrements of a cultural tradition.
Oblivious to the figure seated behind her, a young woman with a baby on her back emerges from a house functioning as a general store. Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photograph captures a moment of suspended motion, in which the young woman's half-lifted foot hovers above the ground. Her shawl's tassels swing in the air and, from afar, appears to brush the seated woman's arm.Alvarez Bravo sometimes referred to this image asSueo de una turista,meaningTourist's Dream. The tourist here is Doris Heydn, his second wife, whose socks and huraches emphasize her foreign origins. Heydn had accompanied Alvarez Bravo on a photography expedition to the countryside. Unaccustomed to extended periods of time in the relentless sun, Heydn was soon exhausted. The two women, oblivious to each other though separated by a few steps, create an ambiguous tension.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo directed this eerie but provocative arrangement of a skeleton clutching a dagger. He included clues, a pearl necklace and earrings, to inform the viewer that the subject is a female. The model for this scene, Doris Heydn, Alvarez Bravo's second wife, holds the end of a dagger near the brooch bearing the wordamada, which means  beloved.  By using the X-Ray process, Alvarez Bravo succeeded in penetrating her exterior flesh and capturing the interior landscape of her body.
The Mexican muralist Diego Rivera once wrote that Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs radiate a  profound and discreet poetry, [a] desperate and refined irony .   This statement is borne out in Alvarez Bravo's image of light falling on tree leaves, which then cast distinct and diffuse shadows on a floating surface, perhaps a canopy or some other type of temporary structure.Aiming his lens upward, Alvarez Bravo captured the stirring clouds that were momentarily suspended in the narrow opening between treetop and shadow-speckled surface. His angled perspective achieved a tension of ascent. In extracting something extraordinary from the everyday, Alvarez Bravo emphasized how visual realities can suddenly appear inscrutable to passersby.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser
Billowing, black smoke fills the sky, obscuring the grazing burro on the right, in this photograph of an adobe brick kiln. Manuel Alvarez Bravo called this imageLa Quema, a term meaning  the fire  or  the burning.  Depicting a landscape threatened by human industry, the image may symbolize more sinister historical events. Alvarez Bravo, who came of age during the violent Revolution of 1910-1920, often saw dead bodies burning in the street.The Mexican people may have viewed the kiln--a site of fiery transmutations--as an allusion to the Spaniards' conquest and purging of the Aztecs in the 1500s. About this image, one historian has said:   The photograph does not project sorrow or excessive drama, but quiet and noble resignation. Even the human figure standing at the base of the kiln pyramid has an attitude, extremely Mexican in character, of resigned acceptance of destiny. 
This crumbling, whitewashed, cemetery speaks of the human need to erect boundaries, a persistent theme in Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs. The wall's foundation, which seems as firmly rooted as the tree growing in the distance, suggests stability and permanence, but its decay signals the ephemeral nature of material things. In this image, Alvarez Bravo used the collapsing wall as a metaphor for the transience of life, a message that a vault inside the cemetery's boundaries somberly reinforces.
Manuel Alvarez Bravo often scrutinized the Mexican landscape, probing its jagged surfaces for signs of human intervention. In this photograph, unusual in his body of work, he depicted one of Mexico's many rugged geological formations. While the eroded, zigzagging slopes of this mountain range create a geometric pattern, the cacti further down provide textural interest. Alvarez Bravo is known for his patience and willingness to wait until exactly the right moment to make a photograph. The image was created when the sun was directly overhead so that shadows would not obscure the varied plant life on the mountain's surface.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser
The leaf of a nopal, or prickly pear cactus, once used by the Aztecs for medicinal purposes, becomes a study in shape and texture in Manuel Alvarez Bravo's sharply focused photograph. Split through the middle, the normally oblong leaf bears irregular pits that dot the surface like craters in the moon. The close range of Alvarez Bravo's lens and the leaf's segmentation lend an artisanal quality to this common Mexican plant.
In contrast to the withered brush at the foot of this cross, festive paper flowers and ribbons adorn the top of this grave marker. Manuel Alvarez Bravo photographed this scene from a low vantage point to illustrate the multiple layers of crosses at work. According to Mexican culture, life and death, intertwined with the idea of rebirth, represent stages of a cosmic process that repeats itself incessantly. Death, therefore, becomes an intricate part of everyday life. Perhaps these decorations were left over from the rituals ofDa de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, when people visit the cemetery to honor their deceased relatives.
The thin trunk and skeletal branches of a leafless tree cast soft shadows against a pristine, white wall, whose solidity seems to contrast with the tree's fragility. Hairline cracks in the wall's surface meander upward from its base in the foreground, as if stretching to meet the tree's branches, and echoing their lines. To the left of the building, a black void--negative space--enhances the mysterious and elusive quality of the scene.
Dancing revelers decorate this Athenianred-figurecup. On the interior, a youthful reveler, naked except for a wreath in his hair and a short cloak over one arm, dances and flourishes his walking stick, a mark of Athenian aristocratic dandies. This lone figure finds his companions in the ten other youths encircling the exterior of the cup. These similarly outfitted youths twist their bodies into elaborate poses with their energetic dancing. Vase-painters in the last decades of the 500s B.C. were interested in accurately portraying the human body in movement and in different postures. The unknown artist of this cup exploited the potential in this scene of revelry for showing the body in a variety of poses.This cup is unusual in that the interior of the cup, except for the small circle of black glaze surrounding the dancing figure, is covered in a coral-red glaze. A rare and difficult technique, coral-red glaze is known from only about sixty surviving vases. This intentional red color, much brighter than the normal reddish color of Athenian clay, was achieved through precisely controlled firing of the vases and was probably expensive to produce.
On the inside of this drinking cup, a nude young athlete pours oil from anaryballosinto his left hand. Behind him is a discus hanging from a sling and two javelins. His features are drawn simply, with short lines representing curls hanging from his head and slight curves and lines defining his muscles. Although his body is in profile, his right eye seems to look at the drinker head-on.Without the benefit of soap, athletes in ancient times rubbed scented oil on their bodies after competition. Then they scraped off the oil, sweat, and dirt with the edge of a bronze blade called a strigil. This vigorous scraping was followed by a steam or sponge bath. Gymnasiums had special rooms for pre- and post-competition oiling, along with bathing facilities.
In the 1500s, young artists practiced their drawing skills by copying the designs of more accomplished draftsmen. Jost Amman produced this image when he was only seventeen years old, carefully reproducing a print by his contemporary Virgil Solis. Although Amman painstakingly duplicated the line work of the original engraving, he changed various other features to display his own virtuosity more clearly. This drawing is far larger than the engraving, and Amman eliminated thebackgroundlandscape to monumentalize the figure of the officer. The artist created texture and depth with only two techniques: fine vertical hatching and thick black outlines. Amman further enhanced the liveliness and sensuousness of the surface by preparing the paper with a pale dusting of black chalk in lines radiating from the figure.
Andrea del Sarto made these drawings as studies for figures in an unfinished painting in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. On therecto, with strong, sure strokes, he worked out the musculature of the kneeling apostle who appears in the painting's left foreground. On theverso, the standing nude figure with drapery provides the pose for Saint Thomas. Of the two heads later crossed out by the artist, the one at the upper right resembles the apostle on the recto. Del Sarto used these poses again in other paintings.Del Sarto's working process of making a series of preparatory drawings for each of his paintings became a model for other artists of the 1500s. He began by quickly jotting down a first idea, then, as in the kneeling figure on the recto, he made studies of individual figures, checking them against a live model. He also used sculpture as a source. Del Sarto then developed the initial composition into a sequence of studies drawn in rapid, soft strokes of black or red chalk, which led to the final version for the painting. The finalcartoonwas transferred to the wall or panel.
Preparatory studies were not necessarily made only for paintings or sculpture: Andrea del Sarto drew these studies for the hood of a cape. Each represents the figure of Moses in the Transfiguration, which was embroidered on the hood of the cape, part of the vestments given to the cathedral of Cortona in 1526 by Margherita Passerini and probably commissioned by her son, a cardinal.The drapery study on therectoillustrates del Sarto's sophistication in creating texture and a range of tones using red chalk. Solely to develop the figure's overall pose, he made the nude study for Moses on theverso, which is much more simply drawn. While del Sarto continued the Florentine HighRenaissancetradition of the large, classic form and measured pose, he also began to deviate slightly from their ideals. The nude figure on the verso may no longer quite represent ideal proportions; he is more stocky, perhaps more like a peasant, when compared to the consistently noble nature of figures by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael.
The lightly drawn figure of a young man with one arm lifted toward the viewer fills this irregularly trimmed sheet. The boy wears a fashionable outfit including a blouse with wide sleeves gathered on either side of the elbow and decoratively slashed to show the lining underneath and a doublet or vest short enough to reveal his codpiece.Concentrating on the pose and drapery of the figure, Andrea del Sarto merely suggested the head and facial features with a few lines. He changed his mind as he drew the right arm, fingers, and the positioning of the left shoulder, leaving visiblepentimenti. This drawing served as a preparatory study for the figure of a young male servant standing in the center of afrescoin a Florentine church. The figure's pose and drapery were almost fully resolved in the drawing, with only a few minor adjustments made in the painting. The artist completed the fresco by May 30, 1523, thus scholars date the drawing to before then.
Andrea del Sarto worked out the problem of placing full-length figures behind a balustrade, or railing on both sides of this sheet. Each side contains two separate compartments with figures in varied poses.With quick, sure strokes of his red chalk, del Sarto experimented with a variety of complex arrangements for each figure's body, sometimes including drapery and always crossing limbs and turning heads. He overlaid numerous ideas for each figure, quickly trying one thought, then modifying it for the next. Beyond giving the figures balance, he aimed to make them look natural and relaxed. With the railing both standing in front of and bisecting the figures, the artist also had to work out how to maintain unity between the upper and lower halves of each figure. The many artistic solutions evident in this study give a glimpse of his fertile and creative mind.Scholars are uncertain about the purpose of these studies, but they may have been initial concepts for the Evangelists in the border of theParamento Passerini, an embroidered altar frontal now in the Museum Diocesano, Cortona.
This is one of six known plates from a service that belonged to the Vigeri family of Savona, whosecoat of armsappears in the center. The painter decorated the wide rim with four heart-shapedmotifsinterspersed with four dolphins, all surrounded by leafy scrolls. The silvery or golden redlusterembellishments that fill thebackgroundare characteristic of Gubbio, a town in central Italy.Four large and four small leafy scrolls in gold luster decorate the back of the plate, while the center is inscribed 'MG1524.' The MG refers to M(aestr)o G(iorgi)o di Pietro Andreoli, a master potter who moved to Gubbio around 1490 and established an active and successful workshop. His skills were so much in demand that he was even engaged to decorate plates from othermaiolicaproduction centers with his famous luster.
Sitting at a drafting table in a private drawing school, an artist concentrates on his work. Pots of ink and drawing instruments lay on the table, whileplaster castsofclassicizingreliefs--common teaching implements in drawing schools--hang on the wall. This vivid watercolor is notable not only for its beauty but for the way in which it reveals the cultural life of the early 1800s. During this period, the art of drawing expanded its influence, leaving the confines of the academy and entering the homes of the middle-class. Andriessen derived his primary source of income from his activity as a private drawing instructor. There is speculation that this may be a self-portrait of the artist in his studio.
Despite this statuette's small size,Jupiter, the supreme Roman god and ruler of Olympus, stands powerful and tall, ready to hurl his punishing thunderbolts. As he raises his arm, his toga falls, revealing clearly defined musculature on his chest and protruding veins on his arms. At his side stands an eagle, theattributethat identifies the god. Based on several well-knownantiquesculptures, the figure conforms to thethundering Jupitertype. The artist has chosen to depict him just before he releases his fatal thunderbolts onto wrongdoers: the anticipation of his raised right arm adds tension to the stable figure.Jupitermay have belonged to a group of figures of Roman gods and goddesses that was designed by the sculptor Michel Anguier for display in an aristocratic home. While multiple casts of the other figures survive, this statuette appears to be the only known cast of the figure of Jupiter. The figure's dramatic gesture, intense focus, and powerful body correspond to the RomanBaroquestyle popular in seventeenth-century France. Theclassicaltheme and the statue's relationship to antique works would also have appealed to aristocratic Frenchpatrons.
Thismanuscriptrecounts in words and pictures the lives and miraculous after-lives of two aristocratic brothers, Aimo and Vermondo, who lived in Milan at the end of the 700s (the text is written in Latin, with the titleLegenda venerabilium virorum Aymonis et Vermondi).It may have belonged to the church that they founded, where their tombs were located and which also owned another illustrated manuscript of their lives. The book would have served as a document confirming the miraculous power of the saintly brothers' mortal remains. It might otherwise have belonged to a devout follower of Aimo and Vermondo. Those who sought miraculous cures or made pilgrimages to a saint's shrine often owned copies of that saint's biography.
Aimo and Vermondo, the two figures with feathered caps, lead four men on a hunt for wild boar. Heading into the wilderness, the small group emerges from a small gated building that summarily represents the city. The men on horseback are engaged in conversation, and a young page on foot precedes the noble riders, surrounded by the dogs. The ornate tunics and dappled horses demonstrate the interest in lavish costume and decorative pattern that was often a feature of works of art made in the International style.
The brothers Aimo and Vermondo stride through the thick underbrush, where they encounter a number of wild boars. The dogs leap toward their prey with their mouths open and teeth bared. At this moment, the combat between the brothers and the boars is a stalemate: although blood pours out of the sides of the boars where they have been pierced by swords, blood also issues from the men's legs where the boars have inflicted grievous wounds.
Aimo and Vermando hold up a small church within a crenellated walled enclosure. The scene is not recounting a feat of superhuman strength in which the two brothers lift up a building. Rather, the image represents the brothers' financing of a new church dedicated to Saint Victor in the town of Meda. After being saved from an attack of wild boars, the brothers donated money for this church as a way of giving thanks. It is in the church of Saint Victor that the two were eventually buried.
The top scene on this page illustrates a procession accompanying the transfer of the saints' bodies from their original burial site to a new location, called a translation. This event was significant because it publicly proclaimed the sanctity and legitimacy of therelicsof Saints Aimo and Vermondo. The devotees who are gathered around the tomb in the lower scene illustrate the belief that the faithful who came into close contact with the relics of the saints could benefit from their power.
After their deaths, Aimo and Vermondo continued to perform miracles, many of which related to healing. No longer living men, they appear here as half-length figures in the sky. The miniature shows three different moments in the story. First, a cart runs over a little girl and the man tending the oxen looks back toward the tragic event. The mother, shown behind the cart, then prays to the two saints. Finally, Aimo and Vermondo appear above and raise their hands in answer to the mother's prayer.
At the top, a father holds up his sick child while the couple prays to Aimo and Vermondo for a cure, which is granted. Below, people kneel in prayer before the two saints. Among these people are rich men and women in fancy robes, others in more humble dress, and robed nuns and tonsured clerics. Together they represent a relatively wide range of humanity in the context of Italy at that time. The center, however, is reserved for the very special people for whom the two saints were advocates and miracle workers: the blind--the figures shown with eyes closed--and the physically challenged--shown with crutches.
Silver-inlaid eyes and excavated pupils give thisbustfigure of a young man a piercing gaze and an arresting presence. Working in bronze, the artist, Pier Jacopo Alari-Bonacolsi, called Antico, realistically depicted such finely finished details as the man's downy facial hair and the heavily undercutmassof his luxuriant curls. Antico copied a Roman marble portrait bust now owned by the Hispanic Society in New York City, possibly as part of a series of bronze heads made forIsabella d'Este'sgrottoin the Gonzaga palace in Mantua. The outdoor fantasy setting of her grotto project incorporated both ancient works and contemporary pieces made specifically for the project.Because of his reputation for reviving ancient forms--the source of his nickname--Antico's sculptural work was perfectly suited to Isabella's project. He adopted the bust format, hollow at the back with a rounded truncated chest, fromclassicalworks.
A battle rages on the top of the rim of this Atheniandinos. Groups of hoplites, or foot soldiers, and a single cavalryman clash amidst waiting chariot teams. Four ships under full sail cover the rim's interior. The rim is the only part of this vessel decorated in theblack-figure technique; shiny black glaze covers the rest of the body. The dinos was a vessel used at asymposiumor drinking party to mix wine and water. The Greeks made a very strong wine that they always drank diluted. When the vessel was full of mixed wine and water, the ships on the inside rim would appear to sail onHomer's wine-dark sea.  The vase-painter Exekias introduced this visual ploy, but it later became a popular scheme of dinos decoration among other vase-painters. Dinoi have rounded bottoms and cannot remain steady on their own. Originally, this vase would have had a stand to support it. The stand here is a modern restoration.
This gradual, measuring over two feet tall, contains the sung parts of the Mass. The large size was deliberate: it enabled a group of singers standing before it to read the notes and words. The saints invoked in the litany suggest that the gradual was made for the Franciscan church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in Rome. The illuminator Antonio da Monza enlivened the border of the manuscript's most elaborate large page with luxurious small-scale decoration that encourages close examination. The antique motifs he used in the border reveal the profound influence of antiquities upon Renaissance artists. After artists rediscovered the Golden House built by the emperor Nero in Rome, and its Fourth Style wall painting, they adopted its grotesques and candelabra motifs.
A grand initialRornaments the most elaborate page in the gradual and marks the introit for Easter, the chant sung by the choir as the priest enters the church. Within the letter, Jesus stands atop his sarcophagus, giving the priestly sign of blessing while holding a cross staff with a banner, a traditional sign of his Resurrection. Below him, several Roman guards awaken from sleep. A long vista extends into the distance to include a monastery.In the border, decorative and figural motifs derived from classical antiquity and known as grotesques delight the eye. Winged putti scamper across the backs of tritons, and Roman monumental lettering mingles with military trophies and carved cameos.
Adecorated initialVopens the introit for Ascension day,Viri galilei quid admiramini aspitie[n]tes(Men of Galilee, why are you astonished gazing up ). Set apart from the rest of the text by its large size, color, andall'anticahandling, the initial is particularly elegant. A variety of forms from antiquity-vine leaves, wreaths, decorative arabesques, and gems-sprout from the letter's armature. A scribe wrote the music in square notation, a system developed in the Middle Ages and still used today.
The introit forPentecostin this gradual opens with the words:Spiritus domini replevit orbe[m] terraru[m](The spirit of the Lord filled the whole world). Thedecorated initialSis a flourish of classically inspired arabesques and horns. Mimicking the sense of the text, theSnearly fills the entire space relegated to it. TheilluminatorAntonio da Monza contained the exuberant curvilinear forms of the initial within anillusionisticframe that seems to project from the page. Da Monza drew on an antique visual vocabulary made popular by the recent discovery of the Golden House ofNeroin Rome.
A portrait of the Greek orator Demosthenes decorates the carved gem of this large gold ring. Demosthenes, the most famous of Athenian orators, was known for speaking out against the growing power of the kingdom ofMacedonia. When Athens fell to the Macedonians in 323 B.C., he fled and committed suicide rather than face execution. Depictions of orators on Roman gems are quite rare, but in the earlyRoman Empireportraits of Demosthenes in all media became popular. Theintaglioportrait on this ring shows the orator as an older, bearded man with a high furrowed forehead and a receding chin. This portrait, as with the other Roman examples, appears to derive from a famous bronze statue of Demothenes by the sculptor Polyeuktes, which was set up in the AthenianAgorain 280 B.C.The gem engraver Apelles signed his name on the face of the gem.
Battle rages before the crenellated walls of a city on the interior of thisred-figurekylixor drinking cup. Two warriors standing on the walls defend the city, while two attackers rush in below. As the defenders lean out from the battlements, menacing with their spears, the attackers raise their shields in response, and the warrior on the right reaches back to hurl a stone. Apollodoros did not identify this battle, but it may be a scene from the mythological Seven against Thebes or theTrojan War. Although vase-painters in the closing years of the 500s B.C. began to show an interest in the setting of their scenes, the depiction of battle in an architectural setting is very rare in Greek art. This use of an architectural backdrop meant that Apollodoros had to alter his vase-painting technique from the standard red-figure. The figures set against the wall had to be drawn in outline.Today the cup is reassembled from fragments, but it was already broken and repaired inantiquity. Five surviving holes near the left handle once held staple-like lead clamps used to reattach the handle.
Vivid scenes drawn from Greek mythology decorate the small surviving portion of this thin bronze strip. The top panel showsMenelaos, king ofSparta, reclaiming his wifeHelenafter theTrojan War, which had been caused by Helen's desertion of Menelaos for her loverParis, prince of Troy. At the right, looking on, is the goddessAthena, identified by the name written beside her in Greek. The lower panel shows thecentaurNessosabductingDeianeira, the wife of the heroHerakles.This piece comes from a strap on the inside of a shield. In the early 500s B.C., the leather strap on a shield's interior was often decorated with strips of bronze showing mythological scenes or monsters. Many such straps come from the Sanctuary ofZeusatOlympia, where worshippers left elaborate shields as dedications or gifts to the gods. The city ofArgosin southern Greece was the major production site of this art form. Although many shield straps include writing that identifies the mythological figures, the lower panel of this strap displays the artist's signature, a rarity in this medium and one of the earliest such occurrences in all of Greek art.
Designed to hold cut flowers orporcelainflowers mounted on naturalistically painted metal stems, this vase form was introduced at the Vincennes Porcelain Manufactory in 1754. It would probably have been set in front of a mirror, so that the elaborately painted scene on the back could also be admired. At the time the vase was produced, the vivid turquoise ground color, developed with aquamarinepigmentimported from Venice, was a recent invention and much admired.The elaborategildingthat frames the bird scenes and marks the edges of the vase is also notable for the skill it required. Gilding had to be applied at least twice over this ground color, as the turquoise-blue color tended to absorb the gold during firing because of its high copper content.
On learning of the birth ofChrist, whom theMagicalled  the King of the Jews,  KingHerodfelt his throne was in jeopardy. Knowing only that the baby was somewhere in Bethlehem, the king ordered Jewish boys around Bethlehem under two years old to be murdered. Alerted by angels, Christ's parents fled to Egypt and saved him.For this drawing, Amico Aspertini borrowed from the ancient Roman sculpture that he had seen in Rome five or ten years before. The intertwining figures at right parallel those on ancient Romansarcophagi. Aspertini's art also included unidealized shapes and awkward bodies. Original and unconventional for the date, his figures look like local peasants rather than ideal types. Aspertini's draftsmanship characteristically included encrusted whitehighlights, squat figures, and manic energy. Between about 1510 and 1520, he often used this colorful combination of red and black chalk with white bodycolor. His extreme whiteheighteninglends the drawing a feeling of near three-dimensionality.
Tiziano Aspetti, one of the most prominent sculptors in late sixteenth-century Venice, probably originally designed this small bronze statue of a nude male either as anandironornament or as one of a group of figures to be placed along abalustradeor in a collector's studio, known as astudiolo. In the 1400s, the image of the nude male and the use of bronze were revived as Italian artists looked back to the culture of ancient Greece and Rome for inspiration. Though its subject is ancient, this work was conceived in a thoroughly innovative style of expressionistic and dramatic movement. In typicalManneriststyle, the figure twists elegantly, revealing a play of shimmering effects on the surface as the light reflects off pronounced muscles. The figure's animated face, as if in mid-speech, was designed to engage the viewer, much as his pose encouraged the viewer to walk around the sculpture.
In 1783Louis XVIcommissioned an impressive new dinner service for the palace ofVersailles, including this wine bottle cooler. By the time the king was executed in 1793, less than half of the proposed 442 pieces had been completed by the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. For example, of the twenty-four wine coolers ordered, only nine were ever finished. Wine coolers were placed on the table or sideboard and filled with ice or cold water to chill the wine.Both the dark, even background color and the detailed reserve scenes are of the very highest quality and indicate that this wine cooler was made for a royal client. The dark blue ground color, known in the factory archives asbeau bleu(beautiful blue), was extremely difficult to fire. Without careful application, the color became patchy and uneven in the kiln or could bleed into other areas of the design. The central reserves are carefully painted with scenes fromclassical antiquity: one illustratesHerculeswhile the other shows Mentor.The reserve  Mentor at Salentum  is from an engraving by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard, after a painting by Charles Monnet. The reserve scene  Hercules  is based on an engraving by Georg Haas, after a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre.Gildinghas been attributed to tienne-Henri Le Guay.
Who was this serious little girl standing so perfectly still to have her portrait made  She is dressed for an outing, her straw bonnet carefully placed on the table beside her and a tasseled basket dangling from her arm. Her name is lost to posterity, but her penetrating gaze has endured. Her  mirror image,  as daguerreotypes were called, will reflect her likeness for generations to come. Her flesh has been lightly hand-colored, a common nineteenth-century practice that added a touch of realism to black-and-white photographs.Although expensive for most of the population--daguerreotypes cost roughly five times the average working-class daily wage in the 1840s--many working-class people sat for daguerreotypists to have their likeness made. Sitters planned for their portraits as carefully as for the most important ceremony, with every detail of presentation thought out beforehand.
Eugne Atget's masterful composition of sinuous tree roots exploits the rich graphic properties inherent in an organic subject. Located at the foot of a wall in the old royal park of Saint-Cloud outside Paris, this site offered a study of interwoven organic textures: wood, stone, moldering leaves, and earth. This is one of the first photographs Atget made of tree roots, a subject that was highly unusual at a time when most images resembled what one photographer called  the worst arty pictorials that existed anywhere.  One critic berated Atget's French contemporaries for trying  to make their photographs look like paintings or charcoal drawings. . . .  While this unexpected image resembles neither a painting nor a drawing, it would have been quite fitting as a source of Art Nouveau imagery, a style that was then flourishing in France.
A busy outdoor market in front of the church of Saint-Mdard, built in the 1100s, was a natural subject for Eugne Atget, who often photographed commercial establishments. He shot this photograph close to noon, past the height of market activity. After choosing from the  largest assortment of goods in Paris,  the market-goers are dispersing, returning to their apartments or perhaps to a restaurant for lunch.
At this intersection, a dome surmounts an architecturally eclectic building with shuttered windows and an arch surmounted by a cartouche. Eugne Atget's quest for the remnants of Paris's past led him to photograph this unusual building, which once housed the medical school of the University of Paris. He also captured the wine shop across from it, with its potted plants along the sidewalk and vegetable cart parked in the street. Despite human activity on each of the three corners, the intersection appears still and quiet.
The Gardes Rpublicains, part of the national military, were a perennial presence in the streets of Paris and thus a fitting subject for Eugne Atget. His photographs depicted all that could be seen in and around Paris, especially its citizens. Lined up along the boulevard du Palais, the guards have assembled in front of the Palais de Justice, under the oldest clock in the city. Atget placed his camera so that their formation begins at the lower left corner of the composition and continues diagonally into the distance. Stooped under the black drape that attached to his bulky camera, Atget evidently captured the curiosity and attention of most of the guards, who gaze at the photographer.Although Atget's primary interest was in documenting the architecture and people of Paris, he often inadvertently captured supplementary information. An advertisement for absinthe, a liquor flavored with wormwood and fennel, appears adjacent to the guards on the right side of the photograph. Soon after this picture was taken, the beverage was outlawed in France because a chemical in one of its ingredients caused convulsions, hallucinations, mental deterioration, and psychoses. It was not until 1918 that a substitute for true absinthe was available.
In this photograph of an alley leading to the facade of Saint Julien le Pauvre, a church built in the 1100s, the viewer's eye follows along the sloped gutter in the center of a cobblestone street. As the drain veers left, the viewer's eye shifts to the church's guardian, comfortably seated by the entrance and gazing at the camera.The extreme clarity of Eugne Atget's photograph recorded the cracked and peeling details of the weather-beaten facade and the missing glass from its rose window. Clearly, a building had once stood to the left of where Atget placed his camera, although all that remains is a boarded-up, hollow space.
Outside the Palace of Monkeys at this street fair, performing dogs and music attracted patrons to an animal circus. An ornately painted organ and humorous illustrations of dogs performing circus antics and dealing cards adorn the stage. A rarity among Eugne Atget's photographs of street fairs, this one includes the crowds as well as the attraction. Both the organ grinder on the far left and a young boy in the center gaze at Atget, more engaged by the action of the photographer than the talent of the dogs.
In the center of this image, four handsomely dressed young girls entertain themselves playing or drawing in the sand. One of them, looking directly into Eugene Atget's lens, is clearly more interested in the photographer. A child too young to participate with the older girls stands eyeing her toy, while a boy on the run appears to have stopped mid-step, curiously staring at the photographer. A nanny looms over the children in the foreground.Gardens such as this one are an enduring aspect of Parisian life, offering a welcome respite from the city's busy boulevards.
Posed with one hand leaning on his cane and the other resting on his hip, this market porter was clearly a compliant subject for Eugne Atget's series of portraits of street tradesmen. As was common with the traditional garb of his profession, the porter's knee-length smock drapes loosely around this man's body, while his broad-brimmed hat almost completely hides his face in shadow. Although he probably used his cane for support, such objects as hats and canes were also, ironically, important accessories carried by aristocratic Frenchmen. Hardly an aristocrat, however, this working man was responsible for carrying crates of produce or animal carcasses in one of the Paris markets.
In this poignant image, achiffonier, or ragpicker, pulls his horseless cart through the Paris streets. The deep shadow that conceals half the vendor's face amplifies the intense expression created by his furrowed brow. Despite being notoriously independent and proud, ragpickers were outcasts in the view of French society.The ragpicker was one of many street vendors photographed by Eugne Atget for his collection of  documents for artists.  Used by engravers and graphic artists, the photographs illustrated a large assortment of trades, from produce vendors and umbrella peddlers to cutlery sharpeners and asphalt layers.
Au Petit Dunkerque, a bar in Paris, was bustling with business when Eugne Atget stood directly in front of the entrance to document it. The name of the establishment is subordinated to the sailing ship above it, a leftover from old Paris, when many businesses advertised with images rather than words because of their largely illiterate clientele. A trellis of grapes grows around the doorframe and heavily barred windows, then a Parisian requirement for premises that sold alcohol. By contrast, the open door is a deep, black chasm from which emerges a truncated, headless ghost in a white shirt and waistcoat. Due to their excessive motion during the exposure, his head and legs have disappeared into a hopeless blur. The striped fabric along the top left edge and the fringe on the folded-back awning across the top of the image create a frame for the facade.
A formally dressed waiter stares at the camera from inside this cabaret while above him hangs a sign depicting an armored man lounging on a cannon; combined with the establishment's name, these two subjects create a strikingly masculine image. Although the presence of the waiter implies that this photograph is a portrait, Eugne Atget was actually documenting the elaborately gilded ironwork sign above the entrance, which dates from the 1700s. Atget photographed a number of such signs, including a baby Bacchus astride a wine cask, and the bucket and pulley at a well.
This graceful staircase in the Htel de Brinvilliers sweeps down into the entrance hall of a house built in 1630. The neglected building was visibly run down by the time Eugne Atget took this photograph. The plaster and stonework are badly stained, and the tiles are scuffed and dirty. The ornate wrought iron railing is all that remains lovely in this once-elegant home.
With his neck extended and mouth open, this wide-eyed dragon adorning the reflecting pool at the Grand Trianon commands attention. His muscular, winged body almost completely fills the frame of Eugne Atget's photograph, conveying a vigorous presence.The Grand Trianon, built by Louis XIV in 1668, provided a place of refuge for the royal family, away from the rigid etiquette observed at the palace of Versailles. The king often hosted concerts and suppers for selected guests at this retreat.
In the 1600s, when literacy was rare, symbols were used to illustrate the goods and services offered by merchants. At this shop front, Eugne Atget photographed a sign that featured a wrought iron rope, bucket, and pulley, which allude to a well. The refreshment drawn up atAu Bon Puits(The Good Well) was not water but wine. This historic sign is now part of a collection in the Muse Carnavalet that focuses on early pictorial signs.
Shop Sign, rue St.-LouisThe elaborately worked iron on this storefront dates to the 1600s, evoking a time when literacy was uncommon and symbols were a more effective means of conveying an idea. Above the shop's door, a babyBacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry, sit astride a cask surrounded by grapevines, announcing to passerby that they could procure wine from the merchant inside.From behind the glass panes of the shop door, a waitress peers out at the photographer in the street. Though Eugne Atget was far more interested in documenting the facade of the wine shop than the waitress's image, her presence adds an engaging aspect to the composition.
While this engaging lampshade vendor holds out several colorful examples in his hands, others of various styles poke awkwardly out of a handmade basket on his back. Standing against a sharply receding old cobblestone street and plying his trade on foot, this old-fashioned street merchant epitomizes a fast-disappearing way of life in urban Europe. The gas lamps for which he sold shade were being rapidly replaced by electric lights, though this process took longer in Europe than in America.Around the turn of the century, Atget produced a small series of photographs on various street merchants, a subject traditionally portrayed by French graphic artists. As a photographer of  documents for artists,  Atget recorded these figures in the hope that they would be of use to his clients. Indeed, the images were often used as source material for postcards and wood engravings.
The long vista seen here was an unusual feature in the photography of Eugne Atget, whose typical urban subjects were constrained by the closeness of their environment. Travelers crossed this monumental bridge ornamented with majestic fountains along the forty-mile road from Paris south-southeast to Fontainebleau, one of the largest palaces built by the kings of France.King Louis XV commissioned the fountains and their sculptural finials as part of his 1728 campaign to improve and embellish French thoroughfares. The water from the fountains provided refreshment for dusty travelers and their horses, but the grandeur of the wide road and its decorative monuments was also especially fitting for the sumptuous destination.
Eugne Atget framed the Temple of Love in the distance with the trunk, branches, and shadow of a thick tree in the foreground, contrasting the formal architecture with the irregular shapes of nature. Commissioned by Marie Antoinette in 1778, this twelve-columned Neoclassical pavilion adorns the garden of the Petit Trianon, a small hideaway adjacent to the palace at Versailles.The Petit Trianon and its extensive grounds, given to Marie Antionette by Louis XVI, provided a retreat from the formal protocol of the French court.
A tree takes center stage in this bold composition principally concerned with the depiction of pedestrian space and a Paris monument. Eugne Atget composed the photograph so that the viewer's eye is led down a path toward Marie de' Medici's seventeenth-century Palais de Luxembourg. Although the path is not occupied on this wintry day, the presence of a few gentlemen--one overlooking the River Seine, another seated on a park bench--suggest that Parisians frequently traveled along it.During the 1600s the rich decoration of the Palais de Luxembourg had a powerful influence on French taste, especially on interior decoration. One of many former royal residences of historical significance in Paris, it saw other uses after the monarchy fell. It served as a prison during the French Revolution, and the senate assembled there during the reign of Napoleon.
This study of a shop window in Paris unites interior with exterior in an intriguing juxtaposition of reflections and objects. The sidewalk, which is completely overexposed in the foreground, is revealed in detail in the reflection of the shop window. A clear depiction of the photographer at work is also evident: Eugne Atget appears in profile, standing at his camera in the lower-center pane of the shop window, as though he is a miniature automaton prominently placed for sale. It is almost impossible, in fact, to tell where the reflection of the street ends and the contents of the shop begin. A lamppost appears to be up for sale alongside a mantel clock; a wagon wheel is displayed just under a cherub to the right of the vases. The overlapping of the contents of the antique store with the everyday objects of the rapidly urbanizing city suggests that Atget was making a commentary about the reduction of Old Paris into nothing more than a collection of curios.
Eugne Atget's photograph of a pavilion and column documents an architecturally and historically significant site. The pavilions were constructed in 1787; six years later, in 1794, more than one thousand people were guillotined here in a two-month period during the French Revolution. Atget was well versed in the history of Paris and was concerned with recording important sites as well as aspects of the culture that were disappearing. The pavilion and the column comprise an ensemble that was part of a gateway in the wall that circled Paris.
Eugne Atget's particular interest in places with historical associations led him to the magnificent chteau of Fontainebleau, where a tourist guide stands at the foot of its famous horseshoe-shaped staircase. Atget's steep perspective resulted in an imposing composition in which the chteau forebodingly looms over the expansive courtyard. The guide's presence enlivens what otherwise would have been an image of frigid majesty.Once a royal palace, Fontainebleau had housed generations of sovereigns beginning as early as the 1100s. The complex and irregular building that currently exists, which includes a court theater commissioned by Napoleon III in the same year as Atget's birth, is the result of numerous additions and alterations by Fontainebleau's many residents.
The largesphinxheads ornamenting this house, built in 1799, reveal the influence ofNapoleon Bonaparte'srecent Egyptian campaign. Other eclectic elements, such as the decorativefriezeof Roman figures above the sphinxes and the vaguely Moorish archedtrefoilwindows on this building, also crept into urban architecture in Paris at this time.Eugne Atget revealed his interest in historic architecture in a letter describing the inventory of negatives that he hoped to sell to thecole des Beaux-Arts:  I have amassed . . . artistic documents of fine civil architecture  from the 1500s through the 1800s,  old hotels, historic or curious houses, . . . fine facades.  Inevitably, Atget also recorded bystanders in his urban photographs; they became fundamental elements of the final images. When taking this picture, Atget and his cumbersome tripod-mountedview cameraclearly drew the attention of four men in front of the street-level restaurant.
Drawn to the masses of dark foliage and the abstract quality of the staircase, Eugne Atget photographed this spot on the left bank of the Seine River repeatedly, beginning in 1904. During the 1600s, orange groves flanked either side of these stairs, which were once part of a royal estate. After the chteau that had occupied these grounds burned in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, the gardens were all that survived.The absence of children or other pedestrians leisurely enjoying the park imparts a sense of solitude and loneliness to the image. Atget intended that his photographs be used as source material for artists of all mediums. This empty park would have provided a simple background, like a stage set, for an artist to copy and then enliven with the addition of figures.
Fallen leaves littering the steps undercut the glory of this monumental sculpture symbolically representing the triumph of France over Spain and Austria. The sculpture, on the grounds of Versailles, was clearly meant to exalt Louis XIV, who wrote,  In my heart I prefer fame above all else, even life itself . . . . Love of glory has the same subtleties as the most tender passions.  He and his ministers often sponsored such works, using allegorical figures and symbols to convey narrative meaning. The trophies of armor signify military skill, and the fleurs-de-lis adorning the shield and garments of the figure in the ceremonial chariot were an emblem long associated with the French crown.
Numerous staircases were necessary to connect the various sections of the gardens on the sloping terrain of Saint-Cloud, a royal summer retreat on the River Seine. This one linked the terrace of the chteau to that of a horseshoe-shaped basin. Although decorative vases remained at the top of the flight of stairs when Eugne Atget made this photograph, the sculptures that once stood on the blocks of stone halfway up the flight had disappeared. His diagonal perspective resulted in a composition of abstract repeated forms, where curving stairs appear as the receding lines of a harmonious and rhythmic study.From the 1700s on, many artists painted the gardens of Saint-Cloud, most often as a landscape or, in some examples, as the background for picnics, parties, and puppet shows. Atget made this image as part of his collection of  documents for artists,  which were meant to be used as source material by all types of artists.
This statue of a grinning Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, looms over a corner of the park at Versailles, squeezing grapes into a bowl as if beseeching visitors to celebrate and make merry. The weathered facade of the statue, however, contrasts with Bacchus's role as a god who should be attended and worshipped; like the overturned chair and the scattered dead leaves, it emphasizes the abandonment of the park. Although a place of great festivities, the empty park appeared desolate and neglected when Eugne Atget photographed it.
This photograph of two arches that were part of an arcade running along one side of the garden of the Palais Royal in Paris is unusual in Eugne Atget's work because of the symmetry and straightforward angle used to define the composition. An illustration of elegant yet colossal design, this image recalls architectural renderings more than photographs. It is one of many Atget made in his  documents for artists  collection, which were meant to be used as preliminary sketches.  Architects would have purchased this photograph for the information it conveyed about the proportions and details of this building from the 1700s.
To a casual observer, Eugne Atget may have seemed like a commercial photographer, making a living documenting architecture for artists, designers, and institutions. Perhaps he had the Bibliothque Historique in mind as a client for a series of photographs he made of Parisian interiors belonging to people of various social classes. This room was undoubtedly the most luxurious of all, located in an ornate building then serving as the Austrian Embassy.In this relatively close-up view, Atget focused on a fireplace with an elaborate clock and candelabras on its mantel, and two floral-patterned chairs on either side. The fireplace is filled with a large mirror that reflects a slipcovered couch, and on it, Atget's hat and overcoat. The photographer's tripod-mounted camera is nearby with a black focusing cloth draped over it. These items suggest the image as a kind of self-portrait, although Atget probably did not intend it as such.Atget was so personally interested in the history of Paris that he spent years documenting the city. As this photograph attests, Atget's work encompassed and transcended both documentation and the seemingly opposing self-expression.
Residents surrounding this narrow passageway provided few signs of their domestic lives for the photographer to record. Baskets and a few rags hang out of the uppermost window, while two people below observe Eugne Atget making this picture. On a windowsill to the right, houseplants bask in the sunlight invading the tall shaftway. Although people inevitably ambled in and out of this courtyard, dropping off and picking up their ironing at  the most pleasant ironers,  the absence of activity when this picture was created conveys a stark sense of gloominess. The weather-beaten facades  and the rubbish bins at the left further underscore this impression. During the time that it took to record the details of this space on Atget's glass plate negative, the brightness of the sunlight from the street outside caused overexposure of the view through the portal.
Carefully arranged produce along the shelves of this neighborhood market created an appealing display for the local customers. Much of the abundant selection, which included apples, peaches, pears, and grape bunches, was assembled in baskets lined with paper or newspaper to increase its attractiveness and cushion its support. Two cauliflower heads at the center of the top shelf surmount the presentation in the same fashion as a floral centerpiece. Merchandise display of all sorts was a persistent theme in the work of Eugne Atget, whose street-level perspective allowed viewers to feel as if they were the passersby encountering the merchandise themselves.
Storefront (Little Bacchus)Eugne Atget made this image of a storefront with a babyBacchusabout seven years after he madeStorefront (Little Bacchus), a photograph that encompassed the shop's entire facade. When he reprinted from his original negative, Atget moved significantly closer to the sign itself, which allowed him to capture the details of the ironwork at a larger scale.Historic architectural embellishment, such as this ironwork, was a significant part of Atget's work. He marketed his series of prints, entitled  documents for artists,  to a modest clientele of artists who would have used the images as source material for their own work.
This secondhand book dealer on the place de la Bastille was so engaged in reading from her merchandise that she ignored Eugne Atget as he made this photograph. The books--arranged on the stand in side-by-side receding rows, or lying flat against the front, or piled on top of one another--create a dynamic geometrical composition that is further underscored by Atget's diagonal perspective.Traditionally, used books have been sold in Paris from stands like these, which are closed at night and during wet weather. This vendor used stacks of books, rather than struts, to hold the stand's lids aloft. When she was ready to close up, the dealer would fold the lids down and the fronts upward.The famous Bastille prison that stood nearby once housed prohibited books, which were considered as dangerous as its other occupants, persons charged with crimes against the Crown. Mobs destroyed the hated structure at the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789.
The angular branches and twisting trunks of these trees form a compelling subject--and they resulted in a dynamic photographic composition. Tree roots, a true challenge to photographers, have rich graphic possibilities. Eugne Atget may have created this image out of an interest in the sources of Art Nouveau, or he may have hoped that an artist-client would purchase it as source material for his or her own work in that style.
Thick lily pads and water lilies floating on this still pool evoke images of Claude Monet's Impressionist paintings, which were made in his garden at Giverny only a few years prior to this photograph. As a photographer specializing in  documents for artists,  Eugne Atget had to try and predict what types of images would be useful to artists as stand-ins for preliminary sketches. Atget may even have created this image in response to the popularity of Monet's numerous water lily paintings.
In Eugne Atget's study of a dignified tree, shadows on the ground mirror the bare branches above. Atget created this symmetrical image when the sun was high, allowing a horizontal axis to center the composition. Although it is a simple subject, the image's nervous radial patterning of branch and shadow convey an unsettling dancing energy. The play of light and shadow was an infrequent subject for Atget, who masterfully exploited their properties in this photograph.Artists, to whom Atget marketed his work, would certainly have found this photograph to be a valuable source of imagery when executing drawings and paintings of landscapes.
The proprietress at this secondhand shop slumped in the sun, dozing among her tightly packed goods while Eugne Atget made this picture. The neat display of suitcases, trunks, satchels, overcoats, lap blankets, and other gear for travelers was carefully arranged along the sidewalk so as to appear most appealing. Two mannequins in chauffeur's uniforms stood guard over both the merchandise and the shop's entry. The eclectic array of goods sold by this establishment included musical instruments and, according to the sign over the shop door, clothes for wedding parties.
Eugne Atget had set out to Compigne, just outside of Paris, to photograph its chateau and park but was clearly captivated by this humble establishment, so he photographed an unpretentious furniture shop. The figure of a craftsman chiseling a piece of wood informed the passerby that the site, once a residence, now housed a cabinetmaker. Used furniture, pictures, and statuary spill out of the crowded interior onto the sidewalk. Inside, clocks fill the shop window.
Masks, shoes, and a crown line the shelves of the window, while a clown suit and a child's military jacket adorn the facade of this extremely modest costume shop. A rod running over the window and door, along with brackets on the building's corner, provided ample space for this merchant to present goods outside the shop itself, a practice regarded as inelegant and unsuitable for valuable items. Eugne Atget's interest in merchandise display specifically excluded the grand windows of bourgeois boutiques and department stores in favor of cheaper commodities hung outside small storefronts and strewn across sidewalks.
In the courtyard of his shop, a metalworker stands with one hand on his hip; a stiffly posed woman, presumably his wife, appears in a window above him; and a man stands in the distance at the end of the alley. The locations of these three people, all of whom direct their attention at the photographer, form a dynamic triangle.The passage de la Runion provided a spatially exciting subject for Eugne Atget, who would have observed the alley's various planes, created by straight and curving walls and their relationship to the patterned road. For this photographer concerned with places and aspects of Parisian life that were disappearing, this alley, essentially unaltered from a much earlier period, was an ideal subject for his photographic collection. Atget sold images such as this one to artists who then used the photographic documents as source material for their own work.
Lying about the sidewalk and on the windowsill are numerous objects and tools from the tinsmith's shop, located inside the darkened doorway. The teapots, pans, and basins easily viewed by passersby would have provided an effective advertisement for this tradesman. The photograph's unusual point of view indicates that Eugne Atget was working in a very narrow passageway, allowing him to record the reflection of sunlight from a variety of timeworn surfaces: battered and abraded stone, scarred metal, and grimy windows.
When creating this photograph of a hairdresser's shop window, Eugne Atget documented the fashionable pompadours and upsweeps of the period as well as the popular plunging necklines and draping shawls. This establishment offered a wide variety of hairstyling services from cutting to dressing and a selection of wigs, both full and partial. To make the shop's services and wares more alluring, the mannequins wear elaborate cosmetics and filmy, delicate fabrics.Beginning in the mid-1800s, when haute couture first appeared, Paris dictated the chic mode in women's styles. Fashion plates and journals throughout Europe and America illustrated French garments and accessories. Although Atget specifically avoided photographing subjects associated with fashion and individual display, this composition reveals his fascination for how shopkeepers exhibited their wares.
This basket maker, a resident of the no-man's-land that existed just outside the old Paris city walls, paused in his work so that Eugne Atget could photograph him. Seated in front of his shack with his raw materials and finished goods, this humble tradesman lived in an area that many poor people, especially junk collectors, called home. The fence along the right side and behind the dwelling shows that property in this village was clearly demarcated and more secure than many of the city's slums. Atget's extensive documentation of Parisians excluded the wealthy in favor of the poor, for whom he was genuinely concerned.
Bundles of newspaper, sacks of rags, and scattered miscellaneous debris at the foot of this ramshackle flight of stairs indicate that this is the domain of a middleman in the junk trade. Over the interior doorway, a neatly lettered sign provides prices for various kinds of scrap, including glass, mixed paper, and iron.In a 1920 letter to the director of the cole des Beaux-Arts, period staircases were among the many images that Eugne Atget listed in his collection of prints. Apparently, Atget felt that the subject was of historical interest and should therefore be documented. When creating images, Atget was primarily concerned with recording subjects--including architecture--that he felt were disappearing from Parisian life and culture. The decay illustrated here clearly showed that this carved wood staircase was not going to endure.
An impoverished ragpicker, considered nothing more than an urban scavenger, partially masked the indigence of his home by affixing recycled debris--including several woebegone dolls and a variety of preserved and mounted animals--to the facade and roof. A makeshift window box, out of which vines creep up onto strings arranged across the window's opening, further enhances the atypically picturesque quality of his shed.Eugne Atget's photograph documented this site from the perspective of the pedestrian, making its viewers feel as if they themselves had just stumbled upon the dwelling. Although a chair props open the door of the shed, the absence of the occupant in the image conveys a sense of trespass and voyeurism.
Leeks, cauliflower, cabbage, and garlic were but a few of the vegetables available from this unpretentious grocery store on an unknown Parisian street. Fruits, momentarily shaded from the sun by burlap covers, were also available. To keep the woven baskets used in the display from upset or theft, the owner threaded a cord through them and attached it to the plank shelving.
Seated among the debris of his junkyard, a proprietor with his back to the camera bends over some task partially hidden behind a trashcan. Pots and pans, baskets, shoes, and clothing are among some of his possessions, which he would have collected in the cart in the left foreground and then sold as scrap goods. Because it would have taken Eugne Atget time to set up his tripod-mounted camera, this man was surely aware that he and his establishment were being photographed.
By composing this picture with the pool in the foreground, Eugne Atget created a dynamic composition that incorporates the sweeping horizontal curve of the pool's edge as well as the receding line of the trees. The pool and gardens at Saint-Cloud were originally designed for Louis XIV's brother, the Duc d'Orlans, whose landscape architect contrived remarkable perspectives by employing optical illusions. To create the effect of great distance, progressively smaller greenery recedes along the alley behind the pool. Although the royal chteau that once occupied these grounds burned in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian war, the gardens survived untouched.
At Charenton, on the eastern outskirts of Paris, Eugne Atget made this carefully constructed study of a wheel-less old mill. The bulk of the building and its buttress bisect the image along a vertical axis, while the grassy bank anchors the composition at the lower right corner. Through the archway at the left, the river recedes from view.
Eugne Atget chose to isolate this cluster of lilies in a close-up study; dozens more out of focus behind the clump create a hazy background. In order to make the  documents for artists  that the sign outside his door advertised, Atget had to consider what types of photographs would be useful to artists as source material. His clients included textile designers, wallpaper designers, and painters, all of whom might have found this image of lilies in bloom quite valuable.
This statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of the harvest, with a sheaf of grain and bouquet of flowers, gazes across an avenue of leafless trees in the deserted garden of Versailles. Although this park had once been a lively and luscious playground of the royal family, Eugne Atget's photograph conveys a somber mood. The absence of people and activity has transformed the garden into a place of isolation.The gardens at Versailles were of great importance to Louis XIV, who oversaw their design and visited them daily when he was at the retreat south of Paris. The king himself wrote a guidebook of the gardens for visitors in 1689, which was revised several times until 1705.
Eugne Atget's penchant for photographing in the early morning accounts for the street's empty stillness. A sole inhabitant peers out from the hotel doorway, so unobtrusive he becomes a part of the architecture as he quietly watches the photographer work.Atget's decision to photograph when the city was deserted heightens the sense of desolate abandonment in the city's older sections, soon to be demolished to make way for grand, broad, new boulevards. The two dark, solemn buildings in the foreground thus frame the old, narrow lane with the solid weight of history. An hourglass-shaped shaft of bright daylight cuts through the frame, dividing the street into shadow and illumination.
A woman wearing high lace-up boots and a short dress of lightweight fabric stands in the doorway of a brothel, presumably where she works. Nothing else distinguishes the faade of the building except for a faint number2above the door; no signs or other markings identify the type of establishment.A fur stole is casually draped around her neck as if it were a cuddling pet, with its long tail trailing down her body. Although she stands in the shadows, she is brilliantly illuminated; the sunlight ironically bathes this woman of the night. She engages with the photographer, Eugne Atget, openly and directly, smiling as though she has encountered him before. Atget frequently photographed women in and around brothels, since he had no access to professional models or respectable women.
In this study of three roses, Eugne Atget captured the flowers at the peak of bloom, just as their petals were beginning to curl under. Although the photograph is symmetrical, with two tall stems flanking a shorter one, each of the three full roses faces a different direction. Fresh buds are visible on the tall stems, as if to remind the viewer that new blooms will soon replace the current blossoms.In order to make the  documents for artists  that the sign outside his door advertised, Atget had to consider what types of photographs would be useful to artists as source material. His clientele included textile designers, wallpaper designers, and painters, all of whom could have found this image of roses in bloom quite valuable.
Eugne Atget made this moody study from a higher vantage point than he usually employed. This departure from his usual practice--a street-level perspective--suggests that he may have been commissioned to photograph this courtyard, where a leafless tree struggles upward as a living contrast to its crumbling surroundings.In a letter to the director of the cole des Beaux-Arts, Atget declared that his collection, meaning his prints and negatives, included  all of Old Paris.  To Atget, it was important not to record popular destinations and fashionable districts but to create  artistic documents . . . of old hotels  and  historic or curious houses.  These urban views were ideal images for his  documents for artists,  a collection of photographs available for purchase by artists as source material for their work.
The curbs of the sidewalk and the sharply angled lines of the dark buildings looming on either side of this image guide the eye along a path through a Paris intersection. Eugne Atget repeatedly photographed this neighborhood, usually during the early morning, when pedestrians were scarce and the streets were tidy. The arrangement of strong horizontal and vertical lines, with the street sharply receding into the distance, resembles a stage set immediately after the curtain rises.
In this meditative image, boats moored near the Pont Neuf, the oldest existing bridge across the River Seine, rest on still water. By the time Eugne Atget created this photograph, he had previously documented the embankments and quays along this section of the river and their attendant commerce. While the earlier images possess a clearly documentary purpose, this image reflects Atget's interest in mood, here effected by the palpable damp rising from the water.The shift from prosaic to poetic studies in Atget's work reflected a change in his sensibility after World War I. Although the mood in these two styles of photography differs, both would have been appropriate for Atget to market to his artist-clients for use as source material.
The carousel is in the exact center of the image; an equal amount of sky and ground surrounds it. Like many of the figures who were captured in Eugne Atget's photographs, the bow-tied bunny at the right appears to be eyeing the photographer cautiously and curiously as Atget goes about recording him. The pleasure spectacle of the carnival ride is made ordinary by the ladder visible at the right toward the back of the ride. Carnivals were usually traveling shows, stopping for only a short while before moving on to the next town, and this attraction was probably still being assembled when Atget came upon it and set his tripod down.The two small, half-oval marks along the top of the print come from the clips that held the glass negative plate in place in the back of the camera. They appear in many of Atget's prints and serve as a kind of trademark, even though they may look like a mistake.
The bare trees and high, weather-stained wall in front of this building convey a contemplative atmosphere that seems especially appropriate for an old convent. Propped against the wall behind the gas lamp, a ladder suggests a romantic scene from literature, perhaps an escape of some sort. Although it was not raining when Eugne Atget created this picture, the wet ground indicates that a downpour had only recently passed.
The three amiable women posing in the doorway of a dilapidated building convey an image of friendship and leisure. Their mid-length dresses and covered legs belie the fact that they are prostitutes. Although Eugne Atget was commissioned to photograph prostitutes in 1921 by a customer writing a book on the subject, scholars have not explained his return to the subject in 1924.Berenice Abbott, who diligently worked to purchase many of Atget's negatives and prints after his death in 1927, printed this image about twenty-five years after Atget made the photograph. Abbott once remarked that  the photographs heralded as art in France in the early part of the century were the worst arty pictorials that existed anywhere.  Especially offensive to Abbott was the way photographers presented their female subjects as inane pictures of the  pretty.  In Atget's work, everyone from small shopkeepers to tradesmen and prostitutes was treated with dignity, an approach that Abbott defined as the  shock of realism. 
Eugne Atget made a number of prints from the negative of this spiky angular building; this example was exposed for longer than the others during the printing process, yielding a darker composition. As a result, the picture gives the dramatic impression that it was made during that indistinct period of early morning when the sun is rising and night is fading away. Other prints of this image are lighter and, consequently, less striking. To accommodate the tall structure within the parameters of his lens, Atget was forced to position his camera at a considerable distance from the building, filling the foreground with an expansive fork in the road.
Historians have suggested that the solitary tree served as a kind of self-portrait in Eugne Atget's photographs. Trees were a favorite subject of the reclusive and private photographer, and they appear often as silent witnesses in his views of Paris and its environs. In a busy architecture study such as this one, the lone, winter-bare tree dominates the composition, its branches drawn carefully on the blank slate of sky. The old neighborhood's bleak textures of mildew, decaying wood and plaster, and scarred stone fill three-quarters of the frame, while the few signs of nature, such as the tree and the modest garden of the house at the left, hold forth a promise of seasonal renewal.
Leafless black trees and sunlit white snow strikingly contrast with the muted gray tones of a brick and stone building in this wintry photograph. Although Eugne Atget made his photographs early in the morning when the sun was strong, the season's dim light resulted in this atmospheric portrait.Atget intended his photographs to be used as source material for artists, such as the noteworthy painter Maurice Utrillo, who favored orderly architectural subjects. Utrillo modeled a 1926 painting on this image, altering the season to spring and adding a few spindly shrubs and several figures.
This gritty photograph of what had once been a grand mansion and an inspiring church conveys the density and decay of a metropolitan center. In the foreground, the facade of the 1625 manor appears to crumble; in the background, the effects of urban industrialization have blackened the formerly pristine church of Saint-Eustache. The short focal point of Eugne Atget's lens compressed the architecture so that the grimy elements of the two buildings are difficult to separate. Cutting across the foreground at a dynamic angle is the rue du Jour, enlivened by the shadowy presence of a woman adjacent to the tilted barrow.
The mannequins in this shop window appear to be engaged in a choreographed game of musical umbrellas, with their delicate hands poised to pluck the protruding handles as they saunter by. They appear aloof, indifferent both to Eugne Atget, who photographs them, and to the mysterious voyeur whose legs, reflected in the glass, are visible just above the  250  sign. The reflection of the blowing trees in the glass may suggest an imminent storm directly above the mannequins' heads, hopelessly blurring the line between inside and outside. The domed building in the reflection is the former chapel of the Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory, which became the Gobelins Museum. Its looming presence frames the mannequins as if they were on a stage.
 Armand the Giant on Display with the Smallest Man in the World,  the sign tantalizingly proclaims. Barely visible within the open tent, a sideshow still life of empty chairs and shoes beckons. Eugne Atget photographed the entrance to this street fair from at least three angles, including this one and a close-up of the display just within the tent.Between the circular vignetting caused by the shifting of Atget's short-focus lens and the string of lights hanging over the top of the artificially grand faade, the tent appears like a two-dimensional set rather than any kind of space that could be entered. The photograph is a study of textures and the visual trickery associated with the street-fair trade. Like a good sideshow attraction, it seduces with its grandiose columns, marble surfaces, and larger-than-life painted illustrations, but what lies within may or may not measure up to such promises. Upon closer inspection, the  marble  base is held together with two strips of tape in the lower right corner, and a rough stick wedged into a corner of the tent opening indicates a less-than-solid structure.
Atop a fancifully painted table, a large chair and a small chair stand silently empty, pushed as far as possible apart from each other and precariously close to the table's edges. Placed in front of each chair and facing each other as if in confrontation are high-topped shoes scaled to the would-be occupants of the seats. Signs with  1  entrance fees and photographs of two men of dramatically unequal size hang suspended around the chairs, seeming to float in space. A lone light bulb hovers above the entire scene, punctuating the blackness with its distinctive silhouette.What is this surreal sideshow still life of presence and absence  Taken just inside the sideshow tent, the photograph is a close-up view of a street-fair display advertising the attraction of Armand the Giant and the smallest man in the world. As Eugne Atget has isolated the arrangement, it is a curiously haunting advertisement that is more disturbing than inviting. He also photographed the fair booth in a sidelong view that shows the tent's fake exterior.
In addition to his interest in documenting the vanishing buildings and neighborhoods of Paris, Eugne Atget wished to record endangered aspects of Parisian life. Seasonal street fairs featuring merry-go-rounds, circuses with menageries, and collections of sideshow freaks were particularly appealing subjects of amusement. Although the fairgoers and sideshow attendants had dispersed by the time Atget made this photograph, litter on the pavement attests to their earlier presence.Atget intended his photographs to be used as source material for artists, such as the noteworthy painter Maurice Utrillo, who modeled a 1927 painting on this image.
When photographing this newly remodeled nightclub in the Place Pigalle section of Montmartre, Eugne Atget deviated from his usual subject matter, Paris's historic architecture. Atget may have chosen to photograph this building to illustrate the sharp contrast between its flat, comparatively windowless planes and the colonnaded buildings that surround it.Although this structure is new, the Place Pigalle had been a center of bawdy nightlife since at least the 1870s, when artists and writers frequented its bohemian cafes and music halls. Despite the Place Pigalle's colorful history, Atget seems not to have photographed here until 1925, when he made this picture. Today's tourists still frequent the area's strip joints, drag shows, and discotheques.
This idyllic part of the River Marne, a short excursion by train from Paris, was a favorite weekend retreat where city dwellers enjoyed riverside cafs and restaurants, fishing, and boating. Rather than photograph a scene crowded with vacationers, Eugne Atget chose to depict this spot as a tranquil setting, with the glassy surface of the river reflecting its stillness. The tethered boats for hire along the riverbank allude to the vacationers who regularly descended upon this popular retreat.
Who were the customers for such an establishment, with its large display windows revealing a most curious product As unlikely as an encounter with this gruesome storefront seems, Eugne Atget chose to photograph it so as to emphasize its accessibility to the passerby on the street; the sidewalk, curb, and brick road take up fully one-third of the frame. The distance from the window also allows for a bit of mystery concerning the creatures or parts being preserved within the jars. Like many of the figures captured in Atget's photographs, the skeleton of the ape appears to be eyeing the photographer cautiously and curiously as Atget goes about recording him.
Late in his life, Eugne Atget made many photographs in a public park that overlooked the river Seine on the outskirts of Paris. The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal chteau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones. Berenice Abbott, a young American photographer who befriended Atget and purchased many of his prints and negatives after his death, made this print some fifteen years later.
Thisphotogenic drawingof a plant specimen shows the stems of the plant species in various stages of growth, from an almost-solid staff to a spidery, blossoming branch. It is a page fromCyanotypesof British and Foreign Ferns, an album of one hundred botanical illustrations with hand-written titles now in the Getty Museum. Anne Dixon originally gave the album to her nephew, who was interested in photographically illustrated volumes.Dixon and Anna Atkins created each image, or photogenic drawing, by carefully placing the specimen onto a sheet of paper that had been made light-sensitive by a coating of a combination of chemicals. The resulting print is called a cyanotype because of the blue color produced by the chemicals. Securing the specimens to the paper with a sheet of glass, the glass and paper were then placed in the sun; after sufficient exposure to light, the paper was washed in water, which caused the image to appear in its final form. Because the specimens were solid objects that light could not pass through, they appear as negative images.
After working as a designer of patterns for carpets, fabrics, and wallpapers, Aubry formed a company to manufacture plaster casts and make photographs of plants and flowers. His detailed prints of natural forms were intended to replace the lithographs traditionally used by students of industrial design. This close-up of a delicate arrangement of leaves and grasses on a lace-covered background appears as if a slight movement of air could disturb it.
Two candelabra, each with four lights, form part of a set of eight from a silver service of over sixty pieces made for the English King George III, who was also Elector of Hanover in Germany. The service, which included plates, dishes, tureens, mustard pots, and condiment vessels, was made for his palace in Herrenhausen, Germany, and seems never to have been taken to England by the king.Robert-Pierre Auguste, the leading French silversmith at the end of the 1700s, created the elegant and restrained tapering forms of these candelabra, with their leafy scrolling arms, delicate beading, and putti.
Jacques-Andr-Joseph Aved created a sense of immediacy by depicting Marc de Villiers, a high government official to the court of Louis XV, leaning slightly forward while fixing the spectator with an intense gaze. Behind him an ornate desk is covered with parliamentary and state papers. Grasping the arm of the chair as if about to rise, Villiers holds a copy of Homer'sIliadin his right hand, giving the impression that he has been interrupted while reading. By appearing in his study and in casual dress, the sitter presents himself not only as a high-ranking official but also as a gentleman scholar.
Under a pale grey winter sky, a variety of figures enjoy ice skating, sledging and conversing. In the foreground, two men play colf, a traditional Dutch sport that is a cross between golf and ice hockey. Hendrik Avercamp, was the first Dutch artist to elevate watercolor and gouache drawings to the status of paintings. His skill is visible here in details like the fine pen and ink lines describing the figures, or the delicate gouache coloring suggesting shadows on the ice. His typical monogram is visible in the lower left (the letterHenclosing the letterA), indicating he saw this as a finished work, not a study.Avercamp was a prolific draftsman, and helped popularize such landscapes with seventeenth-century Dutch collectors. His contemporaries would have appreciated this winter scene on multiple levels. The skaters, some of whom have fallen on the ice, would have suggested the notion ofde slibberachtigheyt van's menschen levenor  the slipperiness of human life,  to remind viewers of life's brevity.
Patronsnormally ordered carved furniture such as these armchairs in sets from amenuisier.In addition to the chairs, the set might have included settees, firescreens, folding screens, tables, and mirrors. All would have formed a large matching group with similar carving,gilding, and upholstery.Intricately carvedRococomotifsof leaves, flowers, and vines decorate these armchairs. Jean Avisse, a leading chairmaker of the mid-1700s, probably made them to furnish a large reception room in a Parisian town house.
In the 1800s Prospect Point at Niagara Falls was a popular destination for travelers in search of a transcendent encounter with nature. The falls were revered as a sacred place that was recognized by the Catholic Church in 1861 as a  pilgrim shrine,  where the faithful could contemplate the landscape as an example of divine majesty.Two well-dressed couples are seen from behind as they stand on the shore downstream from the falls, gazing at its majestic splendor. The silhouetted forms--women wearing full skirts and bonnets and carrying umbrellas and men in stovepipe hats--are sharply outlined against the patch of shore and expansive, white foam.Platt D. Babbitt would customarily set up his camera in an open-sided pavilion and photograph groups of tourists admiring the falls without their knowledge, as he appears to have done here. Later he would sell the unsuspecting subjects their daguerreotype likenesses alongside the natural wonder.
This unidentified woman wears an elegant, colorful dress that was the height of Florentine fashion around 1540. Her costume and music book indicate that she came from a cultured, patricianbackground; she may have been a member of the Frescobaldi, a powerful Florentine banking family that once owned this painting.Bacchiacca's portrait beautifully exemplifies the FlorentineManneriststyle and shows off his ability to represent intricate textile designs, such as the tablecloth's border. Bacchiacca derived his ambiguous space, juxtaposition of dissonant colors, and polished, sculptural treatment of flesh from Agnolo Bronzino's contemporary portrayals of theMedici court.
Two angels swoop down to hover above the manger where the infant Jesus lies sleeping on a pile of straw, cradled by his mother Mary. Numerous other angels peer over her shoulders, eagerly crowding around Joseph to catch a glimpse of the infant Christ, while local shepherds kneel to pay homage with their backs turned to the viewer.Baciccio concentrated on rendering the powerful effects of light in this preparatory study for his painting of the same subject in a church in central Italy. Light seems to radiate from the baby, casting a brilliant glow over the faces of those gathered around his crib. In contrast, broad areas of wash create bold shadows over the bodies of the shepherds crouched on the edge of the drawing. Baciccio also used exuberant, free lines that give the scene a sense of dynamic movement.
A woman poses in front of aparapet, over which an Oriental carpet hangs. She wears a dress of luxurious, heavily brocaded fabric with a daring neckline. Strings of pearls wrap across her shoulders, wrist, and around her headpiece. Her face and chest are brightly lit, and she looks out at the viewer with an assertive gaze. Although her identity is unknown, she is obviously a woman of status and wealth. Jacob Adriaensz. Backer derived the woman's pose from Rembrandt, whose work greatly influenced him.
Scholars are uncertain of both the subject and the artist of this drawing. It seems to show a scene from theGospelofSaint Matthew. WhenChristand his disciples were on their way to Cana, they met a woman who begged Christ to heal her sick daughter. Ignoring the protests of his followers, who objected that the woman was not an Israelite, Christ performed the miracle.With the top of the sheet cut into the shape of an arch, the balanced figures dominate theforegroundplane. Behind them a rocky outcrop supports a cluster of trees, while the road winds across a river into the distance. To lighten the areas of darkerwash, the artist used liberal amounts of whitebodycolorin the landscape.
Jean-Antoine Nollet designed and assembled this pair of globes, which show maps of the earth's surface and skies. Globes frequently adorned the libraries of the aristocracy, lending an air of scholarly respectability in an age when uncharted territories around the world were being mapped and new trade routes established. They frequently appeared in eighteenth-century portraits but were usually supported on simple turned columns. These examples, with their red and yellowlacqueredstands decorated with Chinese figures, are exceptionally elaborate and may have been made to match similarly lacquered furniture.A pair of globes on tripod stands similar to those in the Getty Museum's collection is reproduced in an engraving from 1740 of the library of a wealthy eighteenth-centuryfinancier, Joseph Bonnier de La Mosson. The second floor of his townhouse was devoted to a series of seven rooms, including a chemistry room with fountains and ovens; an apothecary; alatheroom; a room for his drug supplies; a room that housed his collection of minerals and rare animals, stuffed or in jars; and a room filled with machines and models relating to clockmaking, navigation, and hydraulics.
Jean-Franois Nollet, a noted scientist who taught physics to the French royal children, designed and assembled this globe, which shows a map of the night skies. He dated the globe1730and dedicated it to Louis de Bourbon-Cond, comte de Clermont.Clermont was an importantpatronof the arts who became protector of the Socit des Arts in 1728. This was a new organization established to provide collaboration between the arts and sciences; painters, sculptors, astronomers, clockmakers, architects, and goldsmiths were all members.
This engraving, produced by the amateur printmaker William Baillie in June 1774, is a nearly exact copy in reverse of the Getty Museum's drawing by Peter Paul Rubens. As the inscription along the base states, the drawing was made to commemorate a 1636 visit of the  Siamese Ambassador who attended The Court of K[ing] Charles the 1st.  In the 1700s, copies of important works were engraved and distributed among a wide audience. A print such as this one promoted the collection of the drawing's owner, Mr. Willet. It also educated the public on the rare visit of an exotic individual more than one hundred and fifty years earlier. Prints were a vital form of propaganda, information, and portraiture in the era before photography.
David Bailly concentrated his meticulous technique on the details of this woman's face, which pops out of the more sketchily rendered costume, giving an almost three-dimensional effect. He played with the more unusual circular format, echoing its roundness with the girl's head, cap, and stiff lace collar, and added expression to her eyes by scratching the paper to create her pupils' whitehighlights. Influenced by the relaxed approach to portraiture that took hold in Holland around the beginning of the 1600s, Bailly gave the girl expressive eyes, the hint of a smile, and stray locks of hair coming loose from her formal lace headdress.With drawings like this one, Bailly continued the tradition of miniature portrait drawings and engravings that Hendrick Goltzius and Jacques de Gheyn II had established at the end of the 1500s. Bailly also adopted De Gheyn's technique of hatched and stippled modeling in two tones of brown ink.
The Night is not merely sleeping and perhaps dreaming, for sleep is an approach to death. The body in sleep sinks under its own weight. My night is conceived as a state of creativeness. It is the period when subconsciously the human joins with nature's forces, and lives as a tree, a flower, or an insect.--Saul BaizermanThis reclining female figure suggests stillness and movement, fragility and strength. The oversized nude conveys mass and weight, but it is in fact a slender sheet of hammered copper supported by an iron armature. The substantial presence of the form is also undermined by the marked absence of head and neck, arms and feet. Finally, the textured, irregular copper surface, an indelible record of the artist's hammering, also animates the figure's sensual curving form.Saul Baizerman executed a pair of large female nudes entitled Night and Day. Night alludes to the work of Michelangelo--in particular, a marble figure of Night from the tomb of Giuliano de' Medici in Florence created in the early 1500s.
For years, the most distinguished Florentine noblemen, scholars, and artists assembled at the Marchese Valori's country villa outside Florence every summer. There Filippo Baldinucci displayed his considerable amateur artistic talents.  [A]lmost every day he was condemned to make a portrait from life of one of his gentlemen companions, in black and red chalk, choosing by lots each day the one to be portrayed,  wrote his son.Baldinucci drew his friends' portraits, all in roughly the same format, and gave them to his renowned host, who hung them in his villa. After Valori's death, the collection remained intact, becoming part of the Uffizi Gallery's collection in 1866. Baldinucci also made duplicates for his own collection. These duplicate drawings, unbound from the book in which he collected them, were dispersed at London sales in the 1760s. Scholars are uncertain about the identity of this sitter. Theversodisplays an accidental offset from another portrait drawing, most likely by Baldinucci, which suggests that this drawing probably came from his book of duplicates. The residue of a tinted edge along the right side of the paper and traces of stitch holes at the left also demonstrate that the sheet was once part of a sketchbook or album.
A monk preaches to an appreciative audience, with a prominent plaque of Christ in judgment behind his left hand identifying the sermon's theme. At his feet, a seated woman with a long cloak and a covered head clasps her hand dramatically to her heart as if the message has reached her. A plump man in a hat seems attentive but unperturbed, while a standing bearded man has removed his hat out of respect.Hans Baldung Grien arranged the tight composition between two columns, framed by intertwining branches above. A gifted pupil of Albrecht Drer, Baldung Grien had an idiosyncratic style of drawing. He combined long, thin strokes describing the outlines of figures with smaller, sometimes looped strokes for modeling and shading. The stubby hands of the preacher, with their almost circular nails, are also an identifiable feature of his draftsmanship.This drawing's round format and composition suggest to scholars that it was designed as a preparatory study for a stained-glass window.
As he practiced drawing different heads for use in later paintings and prints, Hans Baldung Grien created a pattern unified by abstract hatching. The facing heads represent three distinct facial types: a young woman with long flowing hair and a crown, a bearded man in the top left, and a young man looking upward at the bottom right.By contrast, the six faces clustered in groups of two and four near the upper center of the sheet resemble physiognomic studies, or variations on distinctive profiles. Baldung Grien recorded various hooked, straight, and curving noses combined with rounded, pointed, and sloping or non-existent chins. The artist used light, flowing strokes to outline most of the faces and dark, broader accents to emphasize the eyes, noses, and mouths.
Photographed from below by Edouard Baldus, the Mulatire Bridge over the Rhne River appears monumental. The bridge represents the industrial progress ofSecond EmpireFrance: one arch spans the entire length of the photographic frame, dwarfing the simple, rough-hewn barge moored in its shadow, which symbolizes the French past. The rubble at the bottom left suggests not ancient ruins but an active, modern construction site just out of the frame. The official-looking characters assembled atop the bridge contrast with the workers and observers on the riverbank. The image heralds progress, much like the railroad whose tracks are barely visible on the far bank; both represent a dramatic improvement in technology for France.In July 1861 Baldus was commissioned to produce an album of views of the structures and environments along the railroad from Lyon to the Mediterranean. Thisalbumen printwas included in the album.
Immediately below the bridge on the right, ghost images of a horse and carriage foretell the demise of travel at the fitful pace of animal power. In the presence of the Paris-Lyons and Mediterannean Railroad's new viaduct, the ghost images are dwarfed and almost indistinguishable. The railroad, traveling at three times the speed of a horse and carriage, was a unifying element in France, literally and figuratively bridging the country's various regions and promoting an unprecedented sense of nationhood.Like other photographers working in the 1800s, douard Baldus used long exposure times to make his photographs. If an individual or a carriage moved away from its initial position, a faint impression was captured on the negative and appeared in the print. The impression's transparency gives it its name, a ghost image. While Baldus made this exposure, the horse and carriage repeatedly moved, twice stopping long enough to be faintly recorded on the negative.
Standing on the banks of France's Rhone River, douard Baldus photographed an old town and historic building framed within the arch of a modern iron railroad bridge. Photographs regularly recorded the engineering feats that went hand-in-hand with railroad building, often illustrating links between the past and the future. Just as twenty-first-century train passengers now delight in speeding across France at almost two hundred miles an hour, record speeds of thirty to forty miles per hour exhilarated travelers in the 1800s.
Baldus structured this composition around the perspective lines of the landscape's railway tracks, embankment, and lakeside path, which converge at the center. Human command over the natural world is underscored not only in the photograph's strong geometrical organization but also in its subject. Railways and steam-powered locomotives, a major technological development of the 1800s, transformed life and perceptions of distance by dramatically changing the ease and speed with which one could traverse the countryside.
douard Baldus made this photograph of the newly built train station at Toulon for the Paris-Lyons and Mediterranean Railroad, which commissioned him to document the engineering feats and historical sites along its route. Many railroad companies in America similarly hired photographers to photograph their expanding networks.This image demonstrates the use of glass and cast iron in buildings; extremely popular in France at the time, glass and iron were being used to build everything from libraries and department stores to churches. This proliferation of glass and iron architecture occurred partly as a result of encouragement from Napoleon III, President and Emperor during the Second Empire, who believed that such technological feats best expressed the strength and modernity of France.
Baccio Bandinelli drew the outlines of each nude with strong, confident lines in pen and brown ink. Using parallel strokes of hatching and cross-hatching, he then indicated both the lighting and the volume of the forms, simply by varying the length and curve of the same strokes. Rippling muscles on the chest, as well as the figures' bulging thighs all appear with a few zigzagging strokes.Having trained as a sculptor of both marble and bronze, Bandinelli often found inspiration in the work of his more famous contemporary Michelangelo. Having once boasted that he could produce a sculpture that would rival and even surpass Michelangelo's famous statue of David--he was richly ridiculed when he did not--he took elements from that statue for his own work.  The right arm of the figure on the left and the left arm of the figure on the right derive from the famousDavid.Bandinelli made the drawing on theversoas apreparatory studyfor the head ofHercules, who looks into the distance with a dark, shadowy face.
The form andgiltbands on this small watering can, decorated with sprays of flowers and gilding, imitate contemporary ones made of metal. The VincennesPorcelainManufactory made two sizes of watering cans beginning in 1753. This is the smaller size, only five examples of which are known today. It was probably used indoors for watering plants.
The apotheosis ofHeraklesdecorates the front of this Athenianblack-figureamphora. Identified by his attributes of club and lionskin, Herakles waits while the goddessAthena, his protective deity,mountsthe chariot that will drive him to the home of the gods on Mount Olympos.Hermes, the messenger of the gods, stands behind the horses' heads preparing to lead the chariot. The back of the vase shows a battle scene in which a hoplite, or heavily armed infantryman, falls to the ground between two cavalrymen.Herakles being escorted to Olympos in a chariot was an especially popular subject in Athenian art in the late 500s B.C. Some scholars have suggested that the image's popularity was politically motivated: the tyrants of Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, had adopted Herakles as their symbol. An account of Peisistratos's return from exile, in fact, describes how he had a woman dressed as Athena ride in the chariot with him. This vase was broken and extensively repaired inantiquity. One handle was reattached with staples, and the mouth of the amphora was replaced with one taken from another similar amphora. The substitute mouth appears to be at least twenty years later than the original, indicating that the vase had been used for some time before it was damaged.
During the Civil War, the Quartermaster's department hired George Barnard to record the unprecedented production, transportation, and storage of materials being requisitioned to equip the Union army. At the start of the campaign that would become famous as General Sherman's march to the sea, Barnard documented rows of Chattanooga warehouses where supplies were being amassed. Looking like innocuous barns, the vertical board and batten storage buildings reveal little of their function or content.
This sweeping view of the city of Nashville seen from the landing of the Tennessee Capitol building was made toward the end of the Civil War. In 1862, Nashville was a major Confederate arsenal and industrial city, difficult to reach by land but an easy target by steamboat. When Union gunboats began to race up the river, seen in the distance at the right, Confederate soldiers mounted a defense; nonetheless, the Union captured Nashville that February.This view of the capitol shows the guns in the hands of the Union army, holding command over the city. The Union dominance is subtly represented here by the presence of the weapons in an otherwise tranquil setting.
One of Edgar Degas's earliest documented involvements with photography occurred in 1885, when he directed the creation of a parody of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's grandhistory painting,The Apotheosis ofHomer,now in theLouvreMuseum. A local photographer, Walter Barnes, made the negative and print, surely following Degas's explicit instructions. Entitled theApotheosis of Degas,it is very much an aggrandized self-portrait of Degas.
Federico Barocci made this oil study, the first of two, for analtarpiecein the Church of Santa Croce in Senigallia, Italy. Before beginning this sketch, he oiled the paper, perhaps to eliminate the  halo  the paint's oil would have created as it seeped into the dry paper. Here Barocci studied tonal values for the painting, building a largely monochrome composition from rich, dark browns with brilliant bluish-white highlights in the figures' robes, especially that of the figure on the left who supports Christ's legs. He left the kneeling figure of Saint Mary Magdalene unfinished in the right foreground, though she appears in a similar pose and position in the later, more colorful oil sketch and the finished painting.Barocci commonly used an elaborate preparatory method for planning his pictures. After determining the form of a composition, he made several chalk studies for each figure, including separate studies of the limbs and head. He then drew one or more fully worked-up sketches of the composition, such as this one, and finally moved onto the full-sized cartoon.
Federico Barocci used different colored chalks against colored paper to create a dynamic composition of a single head. He placed the boy's head diagonally on the page, and gave it a sense of forward motion by heavily applying light-colored chalks on the face. These light tones appear to advance to the front, and that movement is heightened by the recession into space created by the blue paper. Throughout his career, Barocci made many such studies of heads drawn from life in colored chalks.Barocci made this tender drawing as a study for the head of the infant Ascanius, son of Aeneas, in his only secular narrative painting,Aeneas's Flight from Troy. Lightly drawn studies for the figure of Ascanius cover the verso.
Federico Barocci applied black and white chalk energetically to describe the body of a man holding a large bowl under one arm. Using assured strokes he captured the man's hunched position as he leans forward, legs bent, balancing the weight of the bowl by leaning to the other side. White chalk lines create texture on his robe as it slips from his shoulders, while softly smudged patches on his shoulders, neck, and face give his body a glistening sheen.Barocci produced the drawing as a study for a servant in the left corner of a painting. On the verso, another sketch shows the same figure drawn facing the opposite direction. Perhaps Barocci made it when he was contemplating placing the figure at the other side of the composition.
Franois Barreau made this virtuoso piece to be admired as a work of art. Its ivory shapes, arranged on four levels in intricate forms such as concentric spheres surrounding a star, would have amazed and delighted its owner. Private scholars and wealthypatronscollected intricate ivory objects such as this one to display in theircabinets de curiosit.Such rooms or series of rooms held unusual or intricate arrangements of rocks, shells, clocks, barometers, or microscopes, displaying the wonders of nature and science.Barreau carved each intricate form from a single block of ivory. The pierced spheres and urns could not be carved by hand but were turned on alathe, a difficult and precise technique that required great patience and skill. Scholars estimate that one sphere could take nearly two hundred hours to produce.
Once thought to be a portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, this painting is now associated with Bartolomeo Veneto. Head tilted to the side and wearing an enigmatic expression, a young woman plays the lute. Instead of consulting the open book of music at the bottom of the painting, the lutist faces the viewer. A sheer veil covers her wavy hair, and embroidered and jeweled trimming lines the bodice and sleeves of her green velvet gown. A fur piece is draped over her left arm. Worn by high-ranking women in the 1500s, such furs were thought to keep away fleas.The many versions and derivations of this portrait made by different artists indicate that the subject enjoyed great popularity in Milan in the first half of the 1500s.
A rust-colored luxury sedan parked in the shade of a young tree serves as the beguilingly mundane focus of this photograph by Adam Bartos. In the early 1990s, Bartos made a series of images at the recreational campgrounds of Hither Hills State Park in Montauk, Long Island. Taken in late afternoon over the course of several years, these evocative photographs documented the ritual of the obligatory family vacation, juxtaposing the cultivated yet natural landscape with its seemingly alien visitors who contrast rather than blend with the setting.
A muted palette of blues and grays conjures up the hazy, late-afternoon summer light. Belying the natural beauty of his Montauk, Long Island, setting, Adam Bartos focused on banal, unlikely components--tent seams; an empty, torn canvas bag; a bare, worn picnic table; and a brown sedan with its hood raised.Adam Bartos made this photograph at the recreational campgrounds of Hither Hills State Park in Montauk, Long Island, as part of an early 1990s series for the photography magazineDouble Take,published in 1997. Taken in late afternoon over the course of several years, these evocative photographs document the ritual of the obligatory family vacation.
This family conspicuously inhabits the human-made space within the image, carefully constructing as much of their world as will fit on the poured slab of concrete. Bringing the trappings of normal domestic life--chairs, table, tablecloths--into the  wild  and tending the campfire from the comfort of one's lawn chair exposes the incongruity of  car camping.      Adam Bartos made this photograph at the recreational campgrounds of Hither Hills State Park in Montauk, Long Island, as part of an early 1990s series for the photography magazineDouble Take,published in 1997. Taken in late afternoon over the course of several years, these evocative photographs document the ritual of the obligatory family vacation.
A precise eye for detail-here articulated by a chipped, slightly singed yellow candle holder nestled between pots and pans--distinguishes the photographs Adam Bartos made in the early 1990s at the recreational campgrounds of Hither Hills State Park in Montauk, Long Island. While the delicately printed tablecloth hints at the contrast between camping and creature comfort, the focus on eating implements connotes a well-worn tradition of domestic still lifes, telling the history of a family through an intimate portrait of its tools for nourishment.
A large python wraps his winding body tightly around the straining gnu, forcing the much larger animal to the ground and biting him on the throat. The two beasts intertwine in a tangle of struggling legs and snake coils. Sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye posed the animals in contradiction to their natures: the light-footed gnu, whose delicate legs skip over rough surfaces, here is brought to the ground, while the snake, whose lack of legs naturally forces him to shimmy along the ground, strikes the gnu's throat in mid-air. Images like this one of a dramatic and ultimatelyRomanticstruggle between life and death made Barye one of the most popular animal sculptors of the 1800s.Made out of plaster retouched with red wax, the sculpture is a model for one of nine bronze groups of struggling animals commissioned by Ferdinand-Philippe, duc d'Orlans. The animal groups were designed as part of a large and elaborate table decoration for the Palais de Tuileries that was never completed. A bronze version of the wax model of thePython and Gnuis now in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore.
Embracing the celebrated Venetian love of color, Jacopo Bassano made only six large compositional studies in colored chalk. Here he combined blue paper, widely used by Venetian draftsmen, with natural black chalk and colored fabricated chalks, including blue, mauve, red, yellow, and peach. Thoughtful consideration of color was integral to his preparation for painting. Bassano used color, not line, to articulate space. The flesh and peach tones in the reclining males at left project outward, Christ's mauve robe draws the eye into space, and the central figure's red costume provides a focal point in themiddle ground.Bassano illustrated an important episode from theNew Testament, in whichJesusshowed his authority in the Temple of Jerusalem, saying,  Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'  But you have made it a den of robbers  (Mark 11:17). After Jesus threw the money changers out of the temple, the chief priests and scribes  kept looking for a way to kill him; for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching. 
A melancholy middle-aged man with a florid complexion, a long beard, and large, watery eyes looks to the side. His head inclines to the right as though he is listening to or observing someone outside the picture frame. His small, soft, half-open mouth seems about to speak. The unknown man's slightly protuberant eyes communicate an emotional state that provokes a sympathetic response from the viewer. Jacopo Bassano emphasized the man's strong, physical presence by the darkened shadow cast against the wall on the left, the solid mass of his upper body, and the way his flesh is modeled to suggest the underlying bone structure of his skull.
TheVirgin Marykneels at anantiquehalf-column decorated with bucrania and swags, a symbol of the pagan world vanquished by the arrival ofJesusChrist. Mary looks up with astonishment from her reading, indicating that the angel Gabriel may once have been part of the sheet before it was cut down. The artist, probably Lazzaro Bastiani, drew the drapery with elegant simplicity. Subtle patterns of light fall across the Virgin's form, highlighting the folds and pleats in her robe. He used tightly executedwashes, modeled with the point of the brush and rendered as hatching in the areas of halftone, such as on the side of the column.
In the upper half of this oil study,Christis depicted in glory surrounded by adoring angels. Looking up at him are fourmartyrsaints: Saints Celsus, Marcionilla, Julian, and Basilissa. Pompeo Batoni made this sketch when he was only twenty-eight, in preparation for his first important commission in Rome. He was commissioned to create a life-sizealtarpiecethat still hangs in the the church of Saints Celsus and Julian today.
In a portrait commemorating his Grand Tour, the Englishman John Talbot, later first Earl Talbot, casually poses full-length before a Romanbackground. Legs crossed in a leisurely manner, the young Talbot leans on his left elbow and rests his right hand on the top of his walking stick. He wears a light gold waistcoat and breeches with a rose-pink velvet coat and white hose and holds a tricornered hat with gold braid. Around him are allusions to his interest inclassical antiquity. The LudovisiMarsstatue on the left and theMediciVase on the right stand for two of Rome's most popular and important works of art. The broken capital in the leftforegroundand the base of a column at the right refer to Rome's classical architectural heritage.Pompeo Batoni was known for his portraits of wealthyGrand Touristsduring their stay in Rome. He frequently depicted them in the presence of antiquities in order to amplify their image as learned, cultivated, yet leisured aristocrats.
Heavy, opaque bodycolor effectively conveys the accretion of snow on the rooftops and riverbank, the dripping icicles in the trees, and the wintry cloud cover. The bodycolor's weight and solidity harmonizes with the muted brown and gray color scheme. Subtly but effectively, Gerrit Battem also added the slightest touches of vivid blue and red to animate the scene.Figures on a Frozen Canalbelongs to a group of whimsical winter cityscapes that Battem made as independent works of art. The luminous bodycolor he chose to use may signal that he intended these drawings to resemble oil paintings.Winter landscapes with peasants had been a fixture of Netherlandish art since the time of Pieter Bruegel the Elder in the 1500s. In the early 1600s, Hendrik Avercamp continued and enlivened the tradition, packing his paintings with incidental detail and brightly colored costumes. Like his predecessor, Battem filled his scene with fun and anecdote as well as fanciful architecture and expressive, skeletonlike trees.
Craftsmen of the 1700s used the highly adaptable material ofgiltbronze in numerous ways, as decorativemountsfor furniture, clocks, ceramics, and light fittings. On this large desk, the elaborate gilt bronze mounts form the main decoration. Gilt bronze frames the drawer fronts with rich sprays and floral clusters, while shell-like corner mounts taper down the legs into leafy scrolling feet known assabots.Shells and vines even decorate the lock plate.Scholars believe thatLouis XVgave this table to the empress of Russia in 1745. In the 1800s it stood in the Oranienbaum Palace near Saint Petersburg.
Every part of this commode is of the highest quality. The front and sides are set with panels of Japaneselacquerthat were removed from an imported chest. Delicatelychasedmeandering gilt-bronzemountshide the seams of the panels, and imitationnashiji,a clear lacquer sprinkled with gold, covers the remaining surfaces. Even the thick marble top is carved both above and below its rim, an unusual refinement.This commode exemplifies the European passion for objects from the Far East and the Parisian taste for transforming these foreign goods into quintessentially French wares. While its form is strictly French, the three panels of imported Japanese lacquer are the focus of the design. Originally of brown lacquer, thebnistepainted the ground of the panels black and added gold decoration in a technique known asvernis Martin.Although the commode is not stamped with the name of a cabinetmaker, it is attributed to the cabinetmakerJosephBaumhauer because it resembles other works stamped with his name. Two trade labels, one on top of the commode under the marble and one underneath the commode, identify themarchand-mercierCharles Darnault, a dealer who sold luxury goods in his Paris shop,Au Roy d'Espagne,as the source of this commode.
The combination of rare and expensive materials used on this cabinet indicates that it was a particularly expensive commission. The four Japaneselacquerpanels date from the mid- to late 1600s and were created with a technique known askijimaki-e.For this type of lacquer, artisans sanded plain wood to heighten its strong grain and used it as thebackgroundof each panel. They then added the scenic elements of landscape, plants, and animals in raised lacquer. Although this technique was common in Japan, such large panels were rarely incorporated into French eighteenth-century furniture.HeavyIonicpilasters, whose copper-filled flutes give an added rich color and contrast to the gilt-bronzemounts, flank the panels. Yellow jasper, a semiprecious stone, rather than the usual marble, forms the top.
This image is an early example of a scientific fundamental of photography--the light sensitive nature of certain chemical compounds. Without the use of a camera or lens, Hippolyte Bayard carefully arranged a delicate selection of laces and flora on a sheet of paper that was made sensitive to light with a combination of iron salts that produced a blue-tonedcyanotypewhen developed. The sheet of sensitized paper with the objects placed upon it is exposed to sunlight in order to make a camera-lessphotogenic drawing.The opacity of the object blocks the light in relation to its density, thus creating a silhouette of the object on the paper. Because the process was relatively uncomplicated, cyanotypes provided a quick method of recording easily recognizable shapes and patterns. Bayard filled the entire sheet of paper, creating a catalog of specimens that reveals the basic structure of each flower, leaf, feather, and scrap of fabric.
A construction worker stands below eye-level amidst the geometric structure of a two-story building. This photographic view of daily life in the 1840s was quite unusual, demonstrating Hippolyte Bayard's early interest in what later came to be considered a social-documentary approach.Aside from his human subject, Bayard seemed drawn to the negative shapes of the broken glass pane of a shuttered window and those of the barred one below. These graphical forms support the photograph's gridlikecomposition, which seems curiously at odds with its gentle framing. The oval mask may have been an attempt to soften the subject's starkness, following a fine-art approach adopted by photographers in the 1800s.Bayard made many views of Paris in the early years following photography's invention, favoring the British-inventedcalotypeprocess over France'sdaguerreotypeprocess. He created this photograph several years before working on a series of architectural studies for the Commission des Monuments Historiques'Mission Hliographique,a French government-sponsored project to record historic buildings around the city. It also predates Eugne Atget's atmospheric, Parisian street scenes made some fifty years later.
One of several self-portraits by amateur gentleman photographer Hippolyte Bayard in the Getty Museum's Collection, this example presents Bayard as a man of the middle class. Although not dressed to plunge his hands in the earth, he looks at home in his garden, surrounded by the commonplace tools of the trade: a barrel, a rustic vase, emptyterracottapots, a watering can, a ladder, and atrellis. The beginning of a vine adorns the trellis and new growth appears at his feet, both of which suggest a new season for the garden as well as the gardener. His confident, proud stance suggests that Bayard was also a gentleman gardener very keen to identify himself with his pastime.
In the mid-1920s, the advent of small, affordable, hand-held cameras such as the Ermanox and the Leica enabled more people to own a camera, and many photographs produced at theBauhausreflect the novelty and ease that these cameras brought to picture-taking. With portable cameras, people could take photographs anywhere--even at the beach--and faster films made it possible to capture motion and spontaneous moments such as this one. The woman's sportiness and skin-baring costume also attest to the changing definitions of femininity in the 1920s.
In Kasahara's garden in Waimea on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, improbable brown, paper bag jackets protect mangos and navel oranges from insects. In the foreground, a lone bird of paradise insinuates its vibrant presence amidst a sea of lush foliage, while on the right a barely noticeable man tends the fragile harvest of another tree. The photographers Virginia Beahan and Laura McPhee neither condemn nor praise the manipulation of the landscape; they simply see the interaction between humankind and nature as a necessity of life.
Here Beahan and McPhee delve into the landscape as a site of human history and conflict. With the High Sierra as a backdrop, rusty remnants of the Manzanar relocation camp, used to detain Japanese Americans during World War II, occupy the foreground. In the middle ground stand the desiccated trunks of an orchard, part of an 1860s settlement that was abandoned after the land's water was diverted in the 1920s to irrigate Los Angeles. The orchard, in turn, had uprooted a community of Paiute Indians, who had lived there for generations.
Before the availability of commercial color materials in 1907, hand-coloring of black and white photographs was an extremely popular practice.The blue of the sky, the pink and green of the flowers, the sitter's dress, and the tablecloth have been delicately tinted to create the illusion of natural color. Although cheaper than a painted portrait, photographs were expensive for the average customer in the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, from the early years of photography, there was a tremendous market for photographic likenesses. This portrait was commissioned by a client, R. Holdsworth; a copy of the original sales receipt still exists. Although the props used in such traditional portraits were often symbolic of the sitter's identity, the blossoms that Mrs. Holdsworth holds in each hand are used here as a pictorial element and as anattributeof femininity.
Twas he has summon'd to her silent BedThe Morning Dream that hover'd o'er her Head.A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-Night Beau. . . .Carrying a long baton tipped with a glittering star, an elegant suitor of the 1700s peers through an opening in the bed-curtains to spy on Belinda, the protagonist in Alexander Pope's poem,The Rape of the Lock.According to the passage from the poem, the suitor probably represents the  Morning Dream  sent to Belinda by her guardian to populate her fantasies.In his typically sensuous and inventive way, Aubrey Beardsley did not illustrate the passage literally; rather, he chose suggestive, fantastic imagery replete with allusions. Long, lacy bed-curtains embroidered with women'sbustsand femininemotifs, such as the peacock, symbolize Belinda. Beardsley's unique manner of drawing includes elaborate layering of patterns, such as the delicate dotting that resembles textile embroidery.
This scene of the Secundra Bagh palace courtyard at Lucknow, India shows the aftermath of the Sepoy Rebellion by the native soldiers(sepoys)of the Bengal Army of the British East India Company. The story goes that the Bengalese soldiers feared that their foreign employer was trying to forceChristianityupon them by violating their cultural taboo. They had purportedly been issued rifle cartridges lubricated with pork and beef lard, which was in violation of Hindu and Moslem laws. In defense of their beliefs, the soldiers attacked an English garrison and colony at Cawnpore. The British retaliated in November 1857, and the scattered bones of some of the 2,000 rebels killed were intentionally left unburied in the courtyard.Historians believe that Felice Beato and his assistants may have rearranged the skeletons seen in theforegroundto heighten the photograph's dramatic impact.
Hodson's Horse was a new British regiment created during the Indian Mutiny in 1857. This irregular light cavalry of two thousand horses was named after its leader, Major William Stephen Raikes Hodson (1821-1858). The regiment included British military officers as well as native soldiers, many of whom were Sikhs from the region of Punjab.
Beato took many views of the Taj Mahal, an iconic monument in India. Dating from the mid-seventeenth century the mausoleum built by the ruler Shah Jahan to honor his late wife is regarded as one of the best examples of the architecture of the Mughal period (1526-1858).
Military paraphernalia strewn about the Pehtang Fort in China reveals that a battle occurred shortly before Felice Beato made this image. For over a decade, China and Britain had been engaged in conflict over Britain's right to import opium into China from India. Chinese officials had made numerous unsuccessful attempts to curtail the import of the highly addictive narcotic. When a Chinese ambassador took a drastic measure in 1839--seizing and destroying over 20,000 chests of British opium--Britain immediately attacked.In 1858 Beato accompanied a British expeditionary force sent to punish the Chinese once again for their resistance and rebelliousness. With the aid of French forces, Britain took possession of the Pehtang Fort on August 2, 1860. By October of that year, the second Opium War, as it came to be known, was over, and Britain was victorious. Beato's image illustrates that the soldiers had been in China long enough to adopt some of their styles and customs--in particular, the water carrier in the center of the image.
Beato made this image not only to celebrate the capture of South Taku Fort, but also to commemorate an earlier episode in the Second Opium War. On June 25, 1859, 89 British sailors were killed and another 252 wounded in the mudflats below the fort. The military atlas includes detailed studies of the Chinese defense.
Beato photographed the North Taku Fort shortly after its capture, creating a sequence of eight views in order to vividly re-create the event. A British military physician, Dr. David F. Rennie, recalled in his memoir of the campaign:  I passed into the fort, and a distressing scene of carnage disclosed itself. . . . Signor Beato was here in great excitement, characterising the group as 'beautiful, ' and begging that it might not be interfered with until perpetuated by his photographic apparatus, which was done a few minutes afterwards.

Beato was able to record the French and British forces regrouping on their way up the coast from Hong Kong to Peking (present-day Beijing). The widespread encampment of the troops nearly fills the four-part panorama and seems to threaten the small local village on the far right.
Taken during the Second Opium War, this 180- degree panorama of Peking (present-day Beijing) seems both to witness and to celebrate the takeover of the Chinese capital by British and French troops. The view is centered on the Da Qing Gate, a passage leading to the Imperial City. The monument to its left is the west wing of the Wu (Meridian) Gate, the main entrance to the Forbidden City.
On October 7, 1860, the French and British troops reached the Summer Palace to find that Emperor Xianfeng (1831-1861) had fled. In retaliation for Chinese mistreatment of British prisoners, the imperial residence, known for its magnificent architecture and rich art collection, was looted and later burned.
When Beato arrived in China, he began recording local life. In April, while waiting for the British and French forces to prepare the upcoming offensive, he went to Canton (present-day Guangzhou) to photograph major monuments, such as the Nine-Storied Pagoda, an ancient Buddhist temple built in 537.

In April, while waiting for the British and French forces to prepare the upcoming offensive, he went to Canton (present-day Guangzhou) to photograph major monuments, such as the Nine-Storied Pagoda, an ancient Buddhist temple built in 537, as well as more vernacular subjects like the lively shops of Treasury Street.
In 1863 Beato joined a Swiss diplomatic mission and managed to take several views of the shogunate capital, Edo (present-day Tokyo). When he set up his camera to make this picture, officers hastily approached him and urged him to stop. Beato asked them to confirm this command with their superior and meanwhile made two exposures. The threatening officers did indeed appear in the final print Beato made.
The monumental sculpture of the Dai Bouts (Great Buddha) had been the centerpiece of a temple that was destroyed by a typhoon. It was an important attraction at Kamakura, and Beato was the first Westerner to photograph it. He posed himself in the scene, sitting on the stairs, while local men climbed the statue.
Beato took many of his scenic views following the course of the historic Tokaido Road, a great highway linking the shogun capital of Edo (present-day Tokyo) with the imperial capital Kyoto and the city of Osaka. In this image featuring the mountainous landscape of Japan and its pine forests, Beato had his porters pose on the wooden paths to create a sense of immediacy.
In late 1863 a delegation of four samurai from the Satsuma clan came to Yokohama to negotiate an indemnity with the British diplomats for the murder of an English merchant in September 1862, as well as to normalize relations between their clan and Britain. In this portrait, Beato captured the samurai's mood of defiance and the tension of the time.
The Bakumatsu period marked the end of the samurai military class. Following the restoration of imperial rule in 1868, domains governed by feudal lords and their samurai were replaced by modern prefectures administrated by governors. The traditional class system was abolished, including such rituals as sword carrying and styles such as the traditional topknot, a haircut featuring a partially shaved head with the remaining hair pulled into a small ponytail.
Beato favored the hand-coloring technique for his series on domestic Japanese society. Full-length portraits, made in the studio or outdoors against a neutral background, isolated the sitters from their immediate environment and focused on their costumes and traditions. Tinting and vignetting around the image enhanced its painterly quality. This image and the one at left show the traditional armored costume of the samurai, the soldier of noble class who served the powerful rulers of Japan.
This portrait depicts the chief artist in charge of hand coloring the photographs in Beato's studio. Its original caption touts the  singular excellence of the Japanese in the art of coloring small pictures, a work that well accords with a character for patience in details.  
Focusing on traditional Japanese life, Beato offered a rare visual record of the last years of feudal Japan before modernization began in the Meiji period in 1871. The kango was then a popular mode of transportation. It was replaced by the rickshaw, a two-wheeled cart pulled by a runner, in the early 1870s.
Beato's studio work catered to his Western audience, but he was also inspired by traditional Japanese imagery. This elaborate studio scene of a woman in winter dress walking in snow is reminiscent of traditional Japanese woodcuts.
Holding a harness while standing in front of a saddle--attributes associated with the duties of a betto (groom)--this elaborately decorated man stands with his tattooed back to the camera. An expensive undertaking, the tattoos were acquired over an extended period. Hand coloring allowed Beato to reproduce the tones of the tattoo that the camera was not able to capture. A study of similar photographs of this subject reveals that, in some cases, the colorists, in fact, created the tattoos.
In a two-day assault, American forces captured and destroyed five forts and killed more than 240 Korean soldiers. Fort McKee was the site of the main offensive. There Beato arranged rebel corpses to create macabre photographs of the battlefields, in a style reminiscent of his work in India and China.
In this group portrait taken onboard the flagshipColorado,its commanding officers are staged as if they were determining where to lay anchor. Beato no doubt saw the commercial potential of the campaign, and he rapidly promoted his work. Views were reproduced in publications such as theNew York TimesandHarper's Weekly.
Here three military officers pose in front of a Korean flag they captured at Fort McKee. The mission was essentially a failure, resulting in unnecessary deaths and failed negotiations between the United States and Korea. Commissioned to make photographs for the Americans, Beato perpetuated the illusion of victory.
Sagaing, the capital of Burma (present-day Myanmar) in the 1300s and 1500s, remained the country's center of Buddhist faith. Hundreds of pagodas, monasteries, and other retreats, including caves, are nestled in the surrounding hills and forests. In this temple there were fortynine representation of Gautama, the founder and primary figure of Buddhism.
Soon after the annexation of Burma (present-day Myanmar), British authorities occupied the Mandalay royal complex and other official and religious buildings. At the time Beato made this photograph, Kyoung, a Burmese monastery, was in fact the master mess house, where the troops took their meals.
Beginning in 1885 Beato used the gelatin dry-plate negative process, developed some fifteen years earlier. Instead of having to laboriously prepare his negatives, he could obtain ready-to-use plates. Their normal exposure time of fractions of a second allowed for almost  instant photography,   permitting Beato to capture people in motion, as in this procession.
Beato made a large selection of portraits, including those of various ethnic groups he encountered during his trips, such as the Kachin people. Photography was popular among the local elite, and they often commissioned studio portraits from him.
Surrounded by attendants and seated at a round table before a tiled, outdoor pavilion, the Chinese emperor and empress enjoy a light meal. While the imperial couple are served tea and fruit, a servant reaches up behind them to remove a platter from a buffet of golden dishes and blue-and-white porcelain arranged in the European fashion. Seated on a stool to the left, a female musician with a monkey at her feet plays a stringed instrument resembling a sitar. In the center, a dwarf dances to her music, while to the right a maid drops incense into a golden incense burner.A large carpet covers the platform on which the emperor and empress sit. The edge of the carpet is woven with the inscription of Guy-Louis Vernansal, who was the chief designer of the tapestry series known asThe Story of the Emperor of China.
In one tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, a woman standing at the left, possibly the Chinese empress, gestures with her fan toward the tropical bounty and beyond to the six-storied pagoda and other buildings in the distance. The tapestry's foreground shows a field of pineapples and other plants, including a palm and a tall banana tree.The first pineapple grown in France had been given to the King of France, Louis XIV, but the fruit was still rare in the early 1700s and its form was probably unknown to the Beauvais artists who wove the tapestry. They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.
In a tapestry from the set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, four attendants carry the Emperor in a palanquin. Two guards on horseback follow the procession, one wearing a sword and bearing the imperial banner and the other carrying a quiver of arrows over his shoulder. The path in front is strewn with cut flowers, apparently from baskets like the one that remains in the center bottom, resting on the border. Birds fill the air above and the palace is visible in the distance.
In a tapestry from the set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, a terraced outdoor pavilion is the setting for the return from the hunt. The emperor, still wearing his quiver and holding his bow, leads the empress down the carpeted steps to show her the catch of game: a deer, waterfowl, and other birds. Behind them stands a large, elaborate throne with sphinxes at each armrest and carved, winged dragons on top. Peacock feathers fan from the crest, and jewels line its upper edge.The double arcade that arches over the throne is a whimsical structure created by the Beauvais artists rather than an authentic Chinese form. This fantastic architecture with its spindly Gothic ornament may have inspired designers of the late 1700s and early 1800s who copied the mixture of Gothic and Far Eastern motifs. This series may be one of the earliest examples of the emergingchinoiseriestyle, in which Westerners employed exotic Chinese forms combined with European motifs.
This woven carpet may have been used to cover a table, but more probably it was meant to lie on the floor. An imaginary light source, imitating the sunlight from a window, casts dark green shadows along one side of the floral garlands, creating the illusion of depth. This fairly small carpet was probably made for asalon,where it may have matched the tapestry upholstery on the chairs and other seat furniture in the room.As there are no identifying marks on this carpet, scholars can only presume on the basis of style that it was made in either a French or Flemish manufactory. Research has shown that the lush garlands of flowers, which combine carnations, daffodils, poppies, roses, and tulips, portray specific varieties of flowers that were introduced to Europe at known dates.
The Offering toBacchus, which shows a decorated pavilion housing a white marble statue of Bacchus, is one of a series of six tapestries known as theGrotesquesseries. The light subject matter and whimsical decoration appealed to a wide range of purchasers, and theGrotesquesbecame one of the most popular sets produced by the Beauvais manufactory. For over forty years, wealthy patrons ordered hangings from the series.Not only the decorative subject matter, which contrasted with the more formal biblical and historical themes of other contemporary tapestry series, but also the flexibility of the design made it popular. Weavers could easily adapt the composition and change the dimensions to fit a specific location without losing the meaning of the design. The orange-brown color of the background, known astabac d'Espagne(Spanish tobacco), also became extremely fashionable, and a few individuals ordered matching furniture upholstery to complement this unusual shade.
As imagined by a French designer of luxury goods, who had probably never been to China, the wife of the Chinese emperor Shun Chi embarks on a pleasure boat ride. Three servants attend the empress, one of whom plays a portable keyboard instrument and sings. Other musicians, acrobats, dancing rats, and monkeys entertain her from the landing.Originally one of a popular, frequently woven set of ten tapestries, this particular subject,  The Empress Sailing,  was least common among the series. Only one other surviving example is known.Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, commissioned this specific tapestry as part of a set for his country residence outside Paris. Nine tapestries from his set are known to survive, each with borders of the same design, including his monogramLAin the four blue ovals of the border. The Getty Museum owns seven tapestries from this set.
In a tapestry from the set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, European and Chinese figures assemble on a stone terrace around an elaborately mounted globe. In the center of the group stands the Chinese emperor, wearing the imperial insignia of the winged dragon and gesturing with one hand while the other rests possessively on the globe. The bearded man taking a measurement on the globe with a pair of compasses is the German Jesuit priest, Father Schall von Bell, who attained a high rank in the Qing court through his knowledge of Western astronomy. He headed the Imperial Astronomical Bureau and developed a close personal relationship with the emperor, based on a shared interest in mathematics and astronomy.The large globe, telescope, and the ecliptic armillary sphere on the dragon-shaped base represent actual objects made by the Chinese after European designs. The originals survive today in the observatory in Beijing.
In a tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, the empress sits cross-legged on a large cushion beneath a small domed pavilion in the open air. A maid shields her from the sun with a parasol, while two others serve her fruit and tea. To the right, a square table holds a large metal ewer and a basket with various glass and blue-and-white porcelain vessels. Floral swags hang from the poles of the pavilion, and a circlet of flowers is suspended in the middle.
Beside a fountain on an outdoor stone terrace, Psyche is groomed by her attendants. Two maids stand behind Psyche and dress her hair. A large mirror reflects her face and one of her attendants. To the left of the mirror, an attendant appears transfixed by Psyche's beauty; another displays a length of pink silk fabric. At the right edge, a seated attendant sorts flowers and converses with a maid who carries powder and perfume on a silver tray. Psyche is probably being prepared for her first night with her new husband,Cupid.Nicolas Besnier, a silversmith and co-director of the Beauvais manufactory, probably advised Boucher on the trio of elaborate silver objects in the foreground--a large pitcher, basin, and tray.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
With arms outstretched, a despairing Psyche gazes upward at the departing figure ofCupid, who arches his back in flight against gray clouds. A trio of naiads, or waternymphs, witness the event, their eyes following Cupid's aerial departure. As Cupid leaves Psyche, she finds herself in a remote and stony wilderness, its lack of hospitality tempered only by the source of a spring whose cascading water becomes a stream.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
Love-struckCupidhas had beautiful Psyche brought to his opulent palace. Amid billowing clouds, Psyche enters the sun-drenched residence, although Cupid himself is not there. She is escorted byZephyr, the butterfly-winged god of the west wind. Psyche walks on aNear Easterncarpet that has been unrolled to receive her. Clusters of languid attendants play music, arrange flowers, or simply admire Psyche's dramatic entrance.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.
A bearded man, the godPan, assists a disheveled Psyche down an earthen path in a wooded vale. They approach two seated women--the goddessCeres, her right arm outstretched, and her daughterProserpine. The two goddesses are surrounded by sheaves of wheat and wicker baskets. In the lower left corner, a nanny goat, one of Pan's attributes, seems to look toward its master. At the top of the tapestry, set into the expansive sky, is agiltcartouche bearing the royalcoat of armsof France and the Kingdom of Navarre (a region of southwest Europe).Either Jean-Baptiste Oudry or Andr Charlemagne Charron also assisted with this tapestry.
This suite of matching furniture, a set of ten armchairs and a settee, is all upholstered with tapestry covers each portraying a different bird. Artisans made the frames from solid mahogany, a fashionable but expensive hardwood that had to be imported into France. Beginning in 1806, during the Napoleonic wars, a Continental blockade prevented France from buying mahogany from the English colonies. Although this impediment further increased the price of the wood, it remained extremely popular among the upper classes.Furniture built in the first decades of the 1800s was heavier and more majestic than earlier styles. In this suite, gilt bronzemountsin the form of rosettes, strands of bellflowers, and leaves decorate the legs, arms, and backs of the chairs and settee.
I saw our Lord fastened upon the cross coming down towards me and surrounding me with a marvelous light...Then there came down from the holes of his blessed wounds five bloody beams, which were directed towards the same parts of my body: to my hands, feet, and heart.This was how, according to legend,Saint Catherine of Sienadescribed receiving thestigmata. In this panel by Domenico Beccafumi, Catherine is shown kneeling in a small chapel while members of her order wonder what is overtaking her, since only she can see the miraculous vision. Another woman sits on the stairs, either asleep or lost in meditation. Analtarpieceshowing theNativityis in thebackground.Beccafumi effectively told the story with a minimum of detail. He uses a striking pose to demonstrate the ecstasy of the saint: she bends forward as if to meet the tilting crucifix, her arms outstretched to receive the stigmata. The small panel and its companion,The Miraculous Communion of Saint Catherine of Siena,were probably made for thepredellaof an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Catherine.
This small panel depicts an episode from the life of the Dominican tertiary and mystic,Saint Catherine of Siena. Upon arriving at church late one day because of her difficulty walking, Saint Catherine was dissuaded by her companions from taking communion because they knew her ensuing ecstasy would last for several hours. She concurred but prayed for God's help in receiving the Eucharist. Miraculously, an angel took a piece of the consecratedhostand gave it to the saint. CelebratingMassat a side altar, her confessor looked around with concern for the missing piece of the host. Neither he nor the others could see the miracle, so their expressions reflect bewilderment.This panel and its companion,Saint Catherine of Siena Receiving theStigmata,were probably made for thepredellaof analtarpiecededicated to the saint.
With his face in shadow, hiding his mixed emotions, the Old Testament patriarch Abraham raises his sword to kill his own son Isaac, bound and also masked in shadow on an altar to the right. God had ordered the sacrifice to test Abraham's faith. But before he could use the weapon, an angel appeared and stopped him, declaring that he had proven his faithfulness to God.Domenico Beccafumi captured the most dramatic moment in the story as a preparatory study for the pavement of the cathedral of Siena in 1547. Although a number of minor differences exist between the drawing and the pavement, this sketch established Abraham's basic pose and gesture. Beccafumi used broad applications of wash to hide his face, indicating where the darker areas were to be on the pavement.
This cooling tower, its worn, corrugated sides crisscrossed with steel supports, is an unwitting work of sculpture. Its industrial purpose is communicated by the title, not the structure's appearance. Centralized and isolated, Bernd and Hilla Becher framed the tower like a gigantic milk bottle placed squarely in a miniaturized landscape, dwarfing the building on its right.The blank, pale gray sky surrounds the tower, emphasizing its clean lines. In order to achieve an overall uniform contrast in the print, the Bechers exposed their negatives on overcast days for even lighting.
We were interested in architecture. But what you call  architecture  is probably designed architecture, and we were both interested in that difference. The principle  form follows function  is rather not in architecture but in industrial buildings.--Hilla BecherIn the early twentieth century, engineering teams rather than individual architects took a strictly  form-follows-function  approach to the industrial buildings they designed throughout Western Europe. These nine examples of water towers in France and Germany exemplify that philosophy. The cylindrical shape of a water tower, for example, reflects its primary function as a storage vessel. Because water towers are concentric and symmetrical, they present one of the simpler types of industrial building that can be described in a single view. As Hilla Becher has explained,  Some objects don't need different views. In this grid of nine images of water towers, the artists encourage viewers to participate in a playful game of examining forms and their details. This comparative analysis of types is a fundamental aspect of their work, from basic form as a reflection of function, to details and material as a reflection of regional styles or late modifications. The Bechers came to refer to arrangments like this as  typologies.  The typology occurs in two forms in their work: organized in more traditional linear sequences, usually in books; or--as exemplified here--arranged in grids to encourage comparisons based on horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacencies.
A cubic thing, like a house, you can photograph from eight different angles and they all make sense. It's logical. And if you put this together, it's like walking around a house.--Hilla BecherThe systematic nature of Bernd and Hilla Becher's photographic approach permeates every aspect of their work. This arrangement of photographs describes one house in eight views, a process that Hilla Becher has described in methodical terms:  You take the street side, the backside, and two side views; and then you take them from all four corners. Published in 1977,Framework Houses of the Siegen Industrial Regionis the first of many books of the Becher's work. The half-timbered construction of these simple houses, some of which are adorned with slate shingles to protect against moisture, is characteristic of the Siegerland, a farming and mining region surrounding the town of Siegen, east of Dsseldorf. The Bechers classified their pictures into categories of gable sides, slated gable sides, street and rear views, slated street and rear views, corner views, and groups of houses. They also includedAbwicklungen(the unfolding) of individual houses, eight views that document each house in its entirety--of which this grid is an example.

To be able to compare photographs, they have to be free from moods. They have to be as neutral as possible. You have to eliminate, and then you can compare anything that's taken from a similar angle.--Hilla BecherDeveloping a systemized approach that they employed consistently throughout their their joint career, Bernd and Hilla Becher documented the Western World's bulwarks of heavy industry, such as this blast furnace. Their no-frills approach is evident in the way that they carefully centered this building's complex structure to fill the picture frame. They also took advantage of natural, even light to reveal reflective surfaces and multiple tiers of scaffolding in exquisite detail. Hilla Becher has likened the blast furnace building type to an  octopus,  with its extended pipes resembling tentacles. When she and Bernd initially considered photographing blast furnaces, it seemed a daunting task. Ultimately, it became her favorite type of structure to approach for the challenge it presented of making sense of its complex form through multiple views.Built solely for the function of smelting iron ore, the blast furnace is one of a number of archaic, anonymously constructed industrial building types that the Bechers focused on throughout their career. Other building types include: lime kilns, cooling towers, winding towers, water towers, gas tanks, and silos. In the forward to their bookAnonyme Skulpturen(Anonymous Sculptures), the Bechers wrote of their subjects:  They are generally buildings where anonymity is accepted to be the style. Their peculiarities originate not in spite of, but because of, the lack of design.

Lotte Beese made this inventive self-portrait by photographing her own shadow against a door. The strong black of the door handle echoes the shape of her truncated hand and the window shadows that intersect her head. The negative-positive quality of the print created by the intense sunlight disorients the viewer.
Oblivious to his cluttered surroundings, the unkempt figure of analchemistsits among a chaotic jumble of paraphernalia. He holds a scale while weighing out a substance for one of his experiments in making gold. By the seventeenth century, alchemy was no longer considered to be a respectable science, and its practitioners were often the subject of ridicule.In thisgenre scene, Cornelis Bega commented on time wasted on materialistic and futile pursuits. Like other Dutch artists of his time, Bega was a close observer of natural appearances. Textures and surfaces of the assorted cracked clay and glass vessels are accurately described. Light pouring in through the open window and the harmonious tones of brown, gray, and blue give the painting a cozy warmth.

Barthel Beham studied the human skull from three different views: side, underside, and front. The care with which he described the intricate pits, crevices, and ridges, particularly on the underside of the middle skull, suggests that he drew them from life. His keen interest in anatomy was a typical manifestation of the emphasis that theRenaissanceplaced on the study of the human form.Beham also varied the level of finish on each skull. He chose to simply outline the right skull with black ink and to use a more complex technique of hatching and cross-hatching to create the shadows and hollows of the base on the center one. The left skull, with its iridescent brow glowing with white bodycolorheightening, a bold outline, and the use of gray wash to cast shadows and create depth, emphasizes Beham's graphic expressiveness. The drawing appears to have been a preparatory sketch for a print.On the other side of the sheet, Beham freely sketched an architectural study showing the top portion of a facade. Scholars are uncertain whether this was simply a fantasy building or a structure to be used for a specific festival.
Hans Sebald Beham chose an unusual pose for his standard bearer. Artists typically portrayed such figures in motion, striding forward with a flag fully unfurled, but Beham chose a static, frontal composition instead. The standard bearer strikes a classical contrapposto pose to balance the visual and actual weight of the massive flag, drawn with delicate penmanship.The standard bearer wears an elegant doublet with wide, flowing sleeves that have been quite literally  torn to ribbons.  The fashion for slashing garments became extremely popular in Europe in the early 1500s, particularly in Germany, where it reached the most extravagant levels. Tailors cut slits in the clothing and pulled the lining through to show off its different color. In the same lavish style, the man wears tights held up with ribbons tied below the knee and a broad hat covered with multiple long plumes. Throughout the drawing, the nineteen-year-old artist used distinctive strokes such as the short, hooked lines on the man's thighs and gnarled collarbone. In the dark folds of the flag, Beham explored shadowy areas through varied patches of dark hatching.
Hans Sebald Beham concentrated on this man's costume, stance, and the implements that he carries, rather than individual facial features. In fact, the man's face is in shadow, partially obscured by the vertical hatching that continues down the right side of his body. The position of legs and arms, the tilt of the head that echoes the line of his extended foot, the doubled lines that emphasize the movement of the leg, and the curved surface of the jar and the cheeses on the ground display Beham's skill in depicting figures and three-dimensional objects. Beham produced numerous drawings and prints that included peasants going about their daily activities. This picture of a young peasant boy and its pendant showing a peasant woman carrying a jug were probably once on the same sheet of paper. Rather than having been made for a specific print, both images perhaps once formed part of a fund of stock types that Beham used in different combinations and poses in his numerous engravings and woodcuts of the poor.
Hans Sebald Beham concentrated on this woman's costume, stance, and the tools that she carries, rather than individual facial features. In fact, the hood that covers her forehead, neck, and chin almost completely obscures her face. The shape of the cloak that covers her humped back, rendered with a few well-chosen lines, echoes the curved shape of her jug. The doubled lines around the jug emphasize the movement conveyed by her bent left leg and her pointing fingers. Beham produced numerous works that included peasants going about their daily activities. This picture of a woman carrying a jug and its pair showing a young peasant holding a jar were probably once on the same sheet of paper. Instead of being made for a specific print, both images may have been part of a fund of stock types that Beham used in different combinations and poses in his numerous engravings and woodcuts of the poor.
The Virgin Mary and Joseph watch with clasped hands as a priest prepares to circumcise their son, the infant Jesus. The drawing's simplified linear style appropriately renders their air of homespun piety. Sebald Beham relied upon simple, bold outlines and hatching to describe the scene, since few details would be visible once the scene was set high in a church window.During the 1520s, Beham and his workshop produced many designs for stained-glass windows. This highly finished sketch was part of a series of more than twenty-five works made for a group of windows showing scenes from the lives of the Virgin and Christ. The drawing functioned as a cartoon for a specialist stained-glass maker, who then cut and painted the glass in shapes and colors according to the design. The color notations and red chalk lines inscribed throughout the drawing indicate the placement of glass sections and leading. The lead was then soldered and cemented around the glass pieces before the panels were secured to the window's iron cross-bars.
Several skilled craftsmen collaborated to produce these elaborate wall lights, as strictguildregulations restricted the work their members could perform. The architect Franois-Joseph Blanger produced the design from which a wax model was then made. Next, a bronze caster poured the bronze into the mold, and finally a skilled bronze worker, such as Pierre Gouthire, gilded and delicatelychasedthe surface of the wall lights.
Surrounded by attendants and seated at a round table before a tiled, outdoor pavilion, the Chinese emperor and empress enjoy a light meal. While the imperial couple are served tea and fruit, a servant reaches up behind them to remove a platter from a buffet of golden dishes and blue-and-white porcelain arranged in the European fashion. Seated on a stool to the left, a female musician with a monkey at her feet plays a stringed instrument resembling a sitar. In the center, a dwarf dances to her music, while to the right a maid drops incense into a golden incense burner.A large carpet covers the platform on which the emperor and empress sit. The edge of the carpet is woven with the inscription of Guy-Louis Vernansal, who was the chief designer of the tapestry series known asThe Story of the Emperor of China.
In one tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, a woman standing at the left, possibly the Chinese empress, gestures with her fan toward the tropical bounty and beyond to the six-storied pagoda and other buildings in the distance. The tapestry's foreground shows a field of pineapples and other plants, including a palm and a tall banana tree.The first pineapple grown in France had been given to the King of France, Louis XIV, but the fruit was still rare in the early 1700s and its form was probably unknown to the Beauvais artists who wove the tapestry. They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.
As imagined by a French designer of luxury goods, who had probably never been to China, the wife of the Chinese emperor Shun Chi embarks on a pleasure boat ride. Three servants attend the empress, one of whom plays a portable keyboard instrument and sings. Other musicians, acrobats, dancing rats, and monkeys entertain her from the landing.Originally one of a popular, frequently woven set of ten tapestries, this particular subject,  The Empress Sailing,  was least common among the series. Only one other surviving example is known.Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, commissioned this specific tapestry as part of a set for his country residence outside Paris. Nine tapestries from his set are known to survive, each with borders of the same design, including his monogramLAin the four blue ovals of the border. The Getty Museum owns seven tapestries from this set.
In a tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, the empress sits cross-legged on a large cushion beneath a small domed pavilion in the open air. A maid shields her from the sun with a parasol, while two others serve her fruit and tea. To the right, a square table holds a large metal ewer and a basket with various glass and blue-and-white porcelain vessels. Floral swags hang from the poles of the pavilion, and a circlet of flowers is suspended in the middle.
The Savonnerie workshops, the royal manufactory that provided carpets, screens, and covers for chairs and benches for the sole use of the French royal household, made this pair of three-panel screens of knotted woolen pile. Such screens were known asparavents(against the wind) and were usually kept folded in the corners of dining rooms or anterooms of the palaces. When needed, servants would arrange the screens to protect the occupants from drafts.The Savonnerie manufactory produced eight different designs for screens, of which the Getty Museum's examples are the tallest. Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay provided thecartoonsfor these screens in 1714, and Franois Desportes drew the birds in the central panels. Each panel has a yellow ground, while the flowers, leaves, and birds are woven in equally vivid shades. The relatively unfaded colors of this pair make them exceptional in comparison to other surviving screens.
A wounded young veteran of the American Civil War, wearing only a shirt and jacket, stands supported by crutches, his right leg severely wounded as described in the photograph's title. A mirror is placed behind him in order to show the leg from multiple angles, but the reflection mercifully reduces the gruesome evidence to shadow, blocked by the right crutch. He stares intently at the camera, perhaps uncomfortable being photographed in such an awkward and immodest position, yet surely grateful to be among the survivors. Like their counterparts in other army branches, medical officers such as William H. Bell, who became official photographer of the Army Medical Museum, carefully documented the effects rather than the events of the war, as well as their healing techniques.
As the distant landscape peeks around in an almost vain attempt to assert its presence within the photograph, the Perched Rock, located at Rocker Creek, Arizona, dominates the frame. Perfectly balanced upon its natural pedestal, the rock's massive bulk poses no threat to the dark, crouched figure of a man below, who has been inserted as a barely noticeable scale marker at the lower right. In 1872 William H. Bell joined the United States War Department's Arizona expedition and survey, under the command of Lieutenant George M. Wheeler. This mounted print was part of an album titledPhotographs. Explorations and Survey West of the Hundredth Meridian 1871, 1872 and 1873.
A young woman with long, curly hair wrestles open the jaws of a lion. The play of light and shadow across her belted dress emphasizes the rounded curves of her body, while Giovanni Bellini's simple yet powerful portrayal of her wrestling grip emphasized his skill with contrasts. He drew the woman's delicate curls with circular strokes, subtly different from the looser, curving lines of the lion's mane. Bellini displayed a confident and assured touch unusual for such a small-scale work.The woman represents Fortitude, one of the four Cardinal Virtues, a symbol of endurance and strength in mythology. She is more usually shown as a warrior, wearing a helmet and holding a shield, spear, or sword. Scholars do not know the purpose of this drawing, but because of its small size, it was likely made for a miniature or manuscript illumination.
The artist, probably Giovanni Bellini, relied on line to create gradations of light and shadow on this bearded man wearing a turban and holding a book. He unified the drawing with a wide range of hatching and cross-hatching, creating texture as well as tonal contrasts on his robe.Representations of Turks became more common in Venetian art of the late 1400s. During this time the Ottoman Empire began to spread westward from its center in ancient Anatolia, now modern Turkey, threatening the independence of Venice. Ottoman armies won important victories in southeastern Europe, and the second Venetian-Ottoman war began in the 1460s, following Venice's refusal to relinquish its forts on the Aegean coast. In 1479 Gentile Bellini traveled to the court of Constantinople as official artist; on his return in 1481, he introduced Venetians to eastern artistic influences.
Bernardo Bellotto was the nephew of Canaletto, a painter renowned for his idealized views of Venice. Together they produced many painted vistas for tourists who stopped in Venice on their Grand Tour of Italy.Grand Touristswould have purchased these types of paintings as souvenirs and reflections of their cultural sophistication.In this architectural record of Venice and the Grand Canal, Bellotto presented a cross-section of Venetian society going about business on a sunny morning. Light from the east falls upon the Palazzo Pisani-Gritti with its arched windows and painted faade. A Venetian devotional box housing various types of religious icons hangs below the arched windows of the building at the left. Such boxes were usually placed on a building right next to the canal so that passers-by could pause for a moment of prayer upon leaving or arriving.Its image reflected in the canal, theBaroquechurch of Santa Maria della Salute dominates the right bank. Next to it, behind a shadowy row of houses, stands theGothicfaade of theAbbeyof San Gregorio. On the far right is the Dogana or customs building. Gondolas and ferries, modes of transportation still in use today, traverse the water between the two banks. The mouth of the canal, where seafaring vessels leave or enter the city, is visible in the distance.
In this view in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Mount Tom, one of the eastern mountains north of Crawford Notch, is visible in the distance, its peak echoing the roof of the plain barn in the center of the image. The photographer Samuel Bemis had come for a holiday visit in the summer, no doubt eager to experiment with his newly purchased daguerreotype camera outfit. One of the earliest surviving outdoor scenes of North America, its foreboding sky actually results from unintentionalsolarizationof the daguerreotype plate, which caused the photograph's highlights to begin to  reverse  into a negative image.
Boston dentist Samuel Bemis, one of the first Americans to use adaguerreotypeoutfit successfully, practiced photography during his summer months in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. His landscape views of the area are the earliest surviving American photographs to depict untamed nature. Here he depicts a scene of rugged beauty.An innovative amateur, Bemis was not a masterful technician of the complicated daguerreotype process. The dark tone of the sky and the light areas along the slope of the mountain indicate inadequate processing of the daguerreotype plate.
According to contemporary biographers, Marco Benefial had an imposing appearance and he was proud of it--a testimony supported by this self-portrait. He presented himself with a pen and a sketchbook, the tools of his profession, and he added a Latin inscription in the cartouche:Aeques Marcus Benefial Romanus Anorum Quadraginta Septem Mensisque Unius(Roman painter Marco Benefial aged forty-seven years and one month). The ornamental border and billowing drapery accentuate his dignified pose, and the loose edges of his open shirt echo the cascading lines of his flowing hair. Benefial made this self-portrait for the Florentine nobleman Francesco Maria Niccol Gabburri, who was known for collecting more than a hundred drawn portraits of artists. Gabburri seems to have had a particular interest in self-portraits, requesting them from dozens of his artistic contemporaries.
The esteemed Flemish artist Simon Bening lavishly illuminated this prayer book for the powerful Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Elector and Archbishop of Mainz and an ambitious patron of the arts. Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion. The sequence of forty-one brilliantly colored, full-page miniatures that Bening produced for the manuscript was designed to evoke an intense empathic response as the viewer contemplated Jesus' suffering.
Thiscoat of armsrepresents the different aspects ofCardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, not only a powerful political andecclesiasticalfigure but also one of the most discerningpatronsofFlemishart of the 1500s. A red cardinal's hat, whose ropes loop around into knots with a calligraphic flourish, sits atop a crucifix. The cross,crozier, and sword refer to the cardinal's sacred and secular duties, including his roles aselectorandarchbishopof Mainz and Magdeburg. Theheraldicsymbols on the shield, mostly variants ongriffins, refer to Albrecht's noble lineage. The image's rich, sensual quality emphasizes the patron's delight in the senses.
Underneath a date palm, a luxuriously clad God the Father lifts up and blesses Eve, his newcreationformed from Adam's rib. Behind the three figures, the golden Fountain of Life pours water into a stream from which the animals of Paradise drink.In thebackground,Adam and Evereach for the forbidden fruit on the Tree of Knowledge. Halfway up the closest hill, an angel wielding a sword drives the couple from Paradise in punishment for their sin. On top of the mountain, Cain andAbeloffer their gifts to God, Abel's signifying God's acceptance with rising smoke and Cain's signifying God's rejection with descending smoke. Thus in the beautiful landscape of Paradise, the tragedy and sorrow of humanity's fate already casts a gloomy pall on the glory of Creation.
This historiated border, which shows God creating birds and fishes, expands upon the subject ofCreationin the facingminiature. The variety of fowl presented at the bottom of the page and the swirling water from which the fish emerge are particularly delightful features. The text is a prayer devoted to the creation of the first humans and their fall from grace.
Seated on a low stool with her arms folded in a gesture of humility, the Virgin gazes piously at aprayer bookopened on her lap. Into this quiet scene of domestic tranquility enters the angel Gabriel to tell Mary that she will bear the son of God. Floating in the air, suspended between heaven and earth, Gabriel points up toward the light of theHoly Spirit, which fills the room with divineillumination. Thus Simon Bening movingly and masterfully represented God taking on human flesh and the realm of the spirit opening up into the everyday world.
Mary andJoseph, four angels, and an ass and an ox cluster in a tight circle around the tinyChristChild. They block the view of two shepherds, who lean out from behind a column to get a glimpse of the child. Two angels above complete the group of adorers, all eager to pay homage to the newborn child.The Roman ruins chosen as the site for theNativityprobably symbolicallyhighlightthe transition from theclassicalto the Christian world that occurred with the birth of Christ.
As was customary according to Hebrew law, a priest circumcisedJesuson the eighth day after his birth. Within this cavernous temple interior, that priest pierces the infant's skin with his knife. Simon Bening implied the building's enormity in part bycuttingoff pillars and statues at the edge of the image, which forcefully suggests the continuation of the space beyond the confines of theminiature.Medieval Christians viewed the circumcision as related to the final events of Christ's life, his Passion and death, because he shed his first blood then. They often discussed Christ's first suffering as a kind of foreshadowing of his final sacrifice on the cross.
In a green meadow dotted with dainty flowers and backed by an ethereal golden sky--not a real space but a spiritual realm--theChristchild sits on a pillow like a precious object, surrounded by seven angels. One angel gestures toward the baby and looks down at a spear, referring to the piercing of Christ's side at theCrucifixion, an event yet to happen. Others hold the nails driven into Christ's hands and feet, his crown of thorns, the cross itself, and a sign that had been attached to the cross with the initials for the Latin wordsJesusofNazareth, King of the Jews.Simon Bening placed thisdevotional image, which projects forward in time to the inevitability of Christ's sacrificial death, in the midst of a series ofnarrativescenes from his infancy.
Although the Virgin and child sit humbly on a carpet on the ground, the red cloth canopy defines the area where they sit as royal. The threeMagi, traditionally described as kings from the East, approach the newbornChristwith sumptuous gifts. Despite their fine clothing, the kings pay homage to Christ by kneeling or bending down to kiss the infant's feet. The base of the largeclassicalcolumn in theforegroundand the beautiful pearls painted as if set into the surrounding frame further lend the scene a regal sense appropriate to the theme of rulers visiting a new and mightier king. Through such imagery, Simon Bening evoked the power of humility, a concept at the core of the Adoration of the Magi story.
Josephand Mary bring the infantJesusinto the entryway of the Temple, whereSimeon, a devout priest of Jerusalem, reaches out to accept the child. According to Hebrew law, the first-born son of each Jewish family was presented to God forty days after his birth. Joseph holds two turtledoves, the traditional sacrifice, while a number of people behind him carry burning candles. Blue smoke rises from the glowing orange wick of a candle that has just been extinguished by a draft from the outside door on the left.TheHoly Spirithad told the elderly Simeon that he would see the Lord's anointed one before dying and urged him to go to the Temple. The Latin inscription around the border records Simeon's words as he took the baby into his arms:Nunc timittis servum tuum Domine secundum(Now you dismiss your servant, Lord, according [to your word]).
Fleeing to Egypt to avoid Herod's massacre of all newborn children,Josephwalks beside his wife theVirgin Mary, who cradles theChristchild while seated on a donkey. As the family passes a paganidolatop a column, it breaks in half, signifying the downfall of paganism and the onset of the new Christian era.  In themiddle groundat the left, soldiers pursuing theHoly Familystop to question a farmer in a field. He truthfully informs them that he saw the family when he was planting his crops, omitting to tell them that the wheat had miraculously grown to full height overnight. Assuming that they had missed the family by months, the soldiers give up their search. These two apocryphal stories often appeared in medieval depictions of theFlight into Egypt.
The twelve-year-oldJesussits on a chair in the center of an octagonal edifice set inside the enormous Temple, visible through the arches. As a group of older men gathers around him listening intently, he holds up his hand with an authority beyond his years. The two full-length sculptures on either side of the centralroundelabove Jesus representMosesandDavid, placing the young Jesus in the context of wiseOld Testamentleaders. Thisminiaturedepicts the story, recounted in theGospelof Luke, of Jesus in the Temple. When Jesus was twelve, his family set out for Jerusalem, where they journeyed every year atPassover. Soon after their departure from the city, Mary andJosephrealized that their child was not with them and returned to search for the boy. On the third day they discovered him in the Temple conversing among the doctors, who were all impressed with his wisdom. When asked by his mother why he had caused his family worry, Jesus responded,  Did you not know that I must be about my father's business  
As described in Matthew'sGospel, the heavens opened at Christ's baptism and the spirit of God descended as a dove. While still including accidental details of nature such as the irregular formations of rock and the reflections in the water, Simon Bening used elements of the story to create a precisely planned geometriccomposition. The stream of water flowing from John the Baptist's hand, the central ray emanating from the dove, and the tall thin tree at the right form a series of defining verticals within theminiature. The reeds in the bottom right corner curve in a way that echoes the circular ripples in the water aroundChristand the curving banks of the river. The golden water, which reflects the light of the Holy Ghost, reveals Bening's great sensitivity as anaturalisticartist treating a sacred theme.
Thinking to approachJesusin a weakened state after his fast of forty days and forty nights, the devil tempts him in three different ways, each depicted in thisminiature. In theforeground, the devil suggests that Jesus change some rocks into bread so that he can eat after forty days without food. Then, in the rightbackground, the devil sitsChriston the pinnacle of the temple of the holy city, saying that if he is truly the son of God, he can prove it by casting himself down, since he should be protected from the fall by angels. Finally, in themiddle groundto the left, the devil takes Christ to a high mountain from which all the kingdoms of the world can be seen and offers him these lands if Christ agrees to adore him. Jesus coolly refuses all of these temptations and commands the devil to leave.
Lazarus had been dead for four days whenChristmiraculously called him back to life in response to the entreaties of Lazarus's devoted sisters, Mary and Martha. The sisters turn toward Christ as he gestures for their brother to emerge from his tomb. In thebackground, one of Christ's disciples, probably Peter, comes to the aid of the bewildered Lazarus, who is still wrapped in his burial shroud.
Upon Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, one man greets him by spreading a garment on the ground while others strew boughs cut from trees along his path. Riding an ass while his disciples follow behind,Christholds his hand up to bless those who have gathered to welcome him. This episode marks the beginning of Christ's Passion.
In thisminiature, Simon Bening concentrated several moments of the Last Supper into a single scene. AsChristannounces that one of those at the table will betray him, the disciples react in a troubled fashion. As he speaks, Christ looks directly atJudas, the bearded man with curly hair on the left.Jesusalso offers him a piece of bread, the means of identifying the betrayer in Saint John's account of the Last Supper. Judas rises up from his seat to accept the bread from Christ.Bening set the scene in a contemporary interior with wooden floors and leaded-glass windows with shutters. To distinguish Christ's special status, Bening included a green brocade canopy behind him, a medieval marker of nobility and another feature contemporary with the artist's world rather than the biblical world.
Having wrapped a towel around himself,Christwashesthe feet of his apostles at the Last Supper. Simon Bening focused his image on Saint Peter's shocked reaction to the idea of Christ washing his feet. Peter throws his hands up into the air in an ostentatious gesture of disbelief that seems to be answered by Christ's own intent movements. The other disciples register their discomfort in varying responses. Seated along the length of the walls of the room, they alternately lean forward and back, creating a sense of visual unrest in theminiature. To make the viewer feel that the event had been captured at a very specific moment in time, Bening represented the water as if it was about to spill over the lip of the basin held by the boy.
JudasIscariot, dressed in blue and yellow robes at the left, secretly meets with the chief priests to name his price for deliveringChristinto their hands. Clutching the bag in which he will keep his ill-earned money, Judas emphatically points upward as if attempting to drive the price higher. One of the priests at the table begins to move the silver coins toward the center while another impassively counts out the amount on his fingers. Simon Bening decided to portray the moment of cold financial negotiation, emphasizing Judas's greed. He also paintedtrompe-l'oeilcurtains drawn back to each side, revealing the sordid, behind-the-scenes event to viewers.
Through the dramaticminiaturesin theprayer bookheilluminatedforCardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Simon Bening encouraged the viewer to identify withJesusin his Passion. TheAgony in the Gardenopens the sequence of devotional texts interspersed with Passion miniatures. To heighten the emotional tension, the artist compressed three events into one scene. In theforegroundthe apostles have fallen asleep despite Jesus' request that they keep watch. In the center of the image, Jesus prays to God, while in thebackgroundthe soldiers already approach toarresthim. Bening emphasized Jesus' emotional isolation as he prays by showing him separated from the apostles by a fence and a fallen tree. Before Jesus, an angel kneels, offering the cup that symbolizes his acceptance of death on the cross.Thenaturalisticdepiction of the dark night sets the mood, creating a dramatic setting for the events. The glow from Jesus'haloin the center provides a spotlight on his face, while in the background the soldiers' torches--painted with tiny dots of gold paint--draw attention to the imminent danger. Even the naturalistic trees flanking the central action increase the drama as they restrict the space around the central figure of Jesus.
Judascompletes hisbetrayalofChristby kissing him on the cheek, thus identifying him to the band of armed men. Upon seeing the cue, one soldier grabs Christ's robes while another dressed in bright blue-and-white-striped leggings reaches for his weapon. In theforeground, Peter raises his sword to cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. Despite the tumult, Christ remains calm and serene, responding to Peter's action by telling him,  Put your sword back in its place: for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.  (Matthew 26: 52)
An armed mob leadsChristaway with his hands bound and a rope around his neck. The torches carried by the crowd burn strong, leaving streams of smoke that trail off to the left, reinforcing the vigorous sense of movement to the right. Although moving to the right, Christ turns his head, present his face to the beholder for contemplation. A man with a wide-open mouth in thebackgroundlooks directly out of the painting, which further engages the beholder. Simon Bening adapted thiscompositionfrom an engraving by the German artist Martin Schongauer.
His head bowed and his hair scraggly and matted,Christcontends with the unruly mob after hisarrest. Many people lay hands on the surrounded prisoner: at the left a man carrying a lantern, whose face registers an almost bestial thirst for blood, rushes forward to get in on the action, while another throws a rope around Christ's neck. At the left, behind the violent frenzy of theforeground, the apostles run off into the darkness. In thisminiature, Simon Bening portrayed Christ at his most pathetic, abandoned, and alone.
Here Simon Bening continued with the stunning effects of flames and light that so fascinated him in the previous nocturnal scenes of Christ'sbetrayalandarrest. The torches brought inside burn with a new, more focused brightness, while the glowing coals and popping embers of the fire behind Annas make his portly figure more prominent. The viewer can almost feel heat coming from the hearth. More than just a skillful display on the artist's part, this detailed observation and representation of the natural world was a means of bringing the events of Christ's life into the viewer's sphere by presenting them as if they were occurring right before the viewer's eyes.
Intense drama marks Simon Bening's cycle of forty-one miniatures of Jesus' life and Passion in the prayer book of Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg. The Denial of Peter, set in an eerily lit hall, captures the climactic moment retold in the Gospel of Matthew, when Peter utters a third denial of his acquaintance with Jesus to a servant girl. She points to the right, where Jesus is being led away through the doorway. Shown on the left, Peter's expression reveals the depth of his agony as he realizes that Jesus' prophecy that he would deny Jesus  before the cock crows  has come true. The cock, with open beak, stands in the cupboard on the right.The intense glow of the fire in the center of the hall casts a naturalistic but also dramatic light on the scene, silhouetting a soldier standing between the viewer and the fire. The artist included other naturalistic details as well: the figure on the right, for example, who yawns sleepily to indicate the late hour. Such prosaic details draw viewers into the story, encouraging them to feel as if they are a part of the scene.
In thisminiaturethe artist Simon Bening emphasized the contrast between the passive and gentleJesus, in a neutral-colored garment, and the aggressively hostile high priestCaiaphas, clothed in more vivid colors and vigorously confronting him. Following Saint Matthew'sGospel, Caiaphas tears at his robe as he accuses Jesus of blasphemy for identifying himself as theMessiah. In contrast, Jesus, his physical beauty underscoring his divinity, calmly accepts his destiny. The artist heightened the drama of the confrontation by setting the scene in a darkened, monumental interior,illuminatedonly by eerie torchlight. By depicting a vulnerable and very human Jesus, Bening encouraged the reader to empathize with Jesus' suffering, a response that the Church and much religious art of the later Middle Ages promoted.Bening framed the scene with simulated wood arches, suggesting that the viewer is peering through a window into a real, three-dimensional space. The frame also recalls the frames found on thealtarpiecesthat graced the interiors of contemporary churches and chapels, reinforcing the devotional nature of the image.
Adorned in fine robes, Pilate stands on a stone portico holding a long staff with a grim expression on his face. An armed man leadsChrist, whose head is bowed and hands are bound, to the portico for judgment. A man in red begins to mount the stairs, looking up toward Pilate and gesturing toward the captive Christ with his hat, perhaps pleading for clemency. Simon Bening depicted a crowd of soldiers behind Christ; their large numbers seem to be still squeezing through the gate in thebackground.
Lavishly dressed in red velvet and ermine,Herodstands before a green-canopied throne on a platform raised aboveChrist. The cloth of the canopy twists around the columns of the throne, echoing and emphasizing the flamboyant, haughty posture of Herod, whose hand casually rests on his hip. In contrast, Christ, stands erect despite his bound hands, while lowering his head in humility.
Pilate, depicted with a pointed cap and long scepter, looks down from the portico of a palace.Christstands amidst his tormentors on the cobblestone street below. A man in red cruelly grabs Jesus' chin, while another leading him by the rope turns and smiles with amusement. A beggar dressed in rags takes joy in Christ's plight, stepping in from the left to make a face and stick out his tongue. In theforeground, a dog also sticks out its tongue. The similarity of expression between man and beast is no accident, for texts of the period often referred to Christ's torturers as dogs.
Stripped of his clothing,Christstands bound to a marble column in the center of thisminiature. Blood from the beating he has already endured covers his entire body and forms a pool at his feet. Simon Bening chose to depict the most dramatic moment possible: all four of the torturers swing back their whips at the same time, making the viewer anticipate the simultaneous strikes that Christ's already broken body will have to endure.
Simon Bening placedChristin the center of thisminiaturein a pose that reveals dignity and grace in the face of his attackers. Despite the grievous wounds he has sustained, Christ retains a solemn beauty while his tormenters appear ugly, foolish, and evil. In juxtaposing the distorted features of the henchmen with Christ's comely figure, Bening followed a common medieval artistic tradition meant to evoke a sympathetic response from the beholder. He also drew the viewer into the scene by placing Pilate and his retinue outside the windows of the torture chamber. In a sense, the officials mirror the position of the person looking at the picture.
Pilate bringsChrist, covered in blood and crowned with thorns, before the Jews in order that they might judge him. The response of the crowd is to call for hiscrucifixion. Because Pilate uttered the wordsEcce Homo(Behold the man) upon presenting Christ to the people, the scene is known by that name. Simon Bening filled the lower half of theminiaturewith the raucous crowd, thereby contrasting the ugly mob with the isolated and vulnerable figure of Christ.
As in many of the judgment scenes in this book,Christcomes before his accuser with his wrists bound, surrounded by a cruel and ugly group of tormentors. According to the Gospels, Pilate found Christ innocent but was reluctant to release him because the Jews wanted him executed. Bowing to the demands of the crowd, he decided to follow custom and release a prisoner onPassover. Upon asking the Jews whether they wanted to free Christ or the robber Barabbas, the people called for Barabbas. Pilate gave in to the wishes of the people but publicly washed his hands as a sign of his disagreement with the decision.
With his brutal captors pulling and prodding him along at an inhuman pace,Christstaggers under the weight of his own cross. Despite his efforts to reach Calvary, the site of hisCrucifixion, his merciless tormentors force him to move ever faster, ferociously raising their weapons to strike if he should hesitate for even a moment.The brutality of the armed men contrasts with the concern of Christ's family and friends. In a ravine to the right, the Virgin and Saint John lead a group of supporters. At the left, in an especially touching episode, an old man--perhapsJosephof Arimathea--helps support the cross, thereby easing Christ's burden.
The re-telling of Jesus' Passion in thisprayer bookclimaxes with this intimate yet powerful image of theCrucifixion.Jesushangs on the cross, suspended above the heads of his followers on the left and the Roman soldiers on the right. TheVirgin Marylowers her head in acceptance of his fate; her closed eyes suggest the depth of her grief. Below Jesus, Mary Magdalene kneels, clinging to the cross and wailing in anguish.Presented in anillusionisticarchitectural frame that almost turns theminiatureinto a small, framedaltarpiece, the image focuses meditation on Jesus' suffering. Mary Magdalene, shown from behind, shares the viewers' vantage point, encouraging them to identify with her sorrow. Both the image and the text opposite, a meditation on the Crucifixion, serve to bring the reader to a closer, more direct understanding of the Passion.Reproducing the scene as described in the Gospels, the artist Simon Bening painted an evocative nocturnal landscape, setting the tone for the mournful event. Skulls at the foot of the cross, identifying the site as Mount Golgotha, further contribute to the eeriness.
Following themanuscript'searliernarrativescenes of Christ's Passion, Simon Bening painted an image that concentrates on Christ's wounds. Focusing on his body as an object of worship rather than showing a specific dramatic episode from his life, this picture invites meditation on Christ's physical suffering and ultimate triumph over torture and death. Bening here meant to inspire the faithful with a sense of Christ's eternal presence rather than making the viewer an eyewitness to distant historical events.
Two angels hold up the tablet that Pilate ordered to be attached to the cross. According to theGospelof John, it bore Christ's appellation,  JesusofNazareth, King of the Jews,  in three languages: Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. On each side, an angel holds a candle and draws back the curtains to reveal the holy object. In the middle, another angel swings a censer, from which smoke flows toward the tablet. Conceiving the scene as a dramatic ritual presented to the beholder, Simon Bening thus singled out one of the objects from theCrucifixionfor special worship.
In contrast to the tumultuous scenes of crowds, torture, and high-pitched grief at theCrucifixion, this image focuses on the relationship between mother and son. As the soldiers and crowd move off in the distance and passersby point up toward Christ's ravaged body, the Virgin, Saint John, and Mary Magdalene take a moment for quiet sorrow. Transparent angels appear in the blue clouds, suggesting the heavenly preparation forChrist. Thisminiatureof the Crucifixion faces a text devoted to the Virgin's sorrow and compassion at her son's death.
While a crowd gathers in the lower half of theminiature, the bodies ofChristand the two thieves remain silhouetted against a light blue sky in the upper half of theillumination. By isolating the body of Christ against this bluebackground, Simon Bening emphasized the long lance piercing his side; a text devoted to the lancing directly follows this illumination. At the bottom left, the Virgin swoons with grief, supported by Saint John and two women. John's hand touches the area of Mary's side that corresponds to the lance wound in Christ's side, drawing attention to the pain she shares with her son.
And behold, there was a man namedJoseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man (this one had not consented to their counsel and doings) of Arimathea, a city of Judea, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body ofJesus.(Luke, 23:50-52)Kneeling in the center,Joseph of Arimatheaman pleads withPontius Pilate, who stands on the left in a magnificent brocade robe. Simon Bening contrasted Pilate's imperious stance, hand on hip and staff of office raised, with Joseph's posture of humility. Pilate stands beneath the arch of an imposing stone facade reaching up to the miniature's top frame, while a serene town, the open blue sky visible above, serves as a backdrop for Joseph and his companions. Bening thus divided theilluminationinto two halves, using body language and setting to increase the viewer's compassion for Joseph's cause.
Mourners in thebackgroundstruggle to bring down the ravaged body ofChristwith some sense of dignity. The mourners appear again in front, this time tending to the body, displayed so that the viewer sees it, stiff in death, from head to toe. The viewer is meant to meditate on the body, modeling his or her emotional reactions on those of the mourners. The Virgin cradles Christ's head and puts her hand to her breast, the Magdalene gently holds and looks at his hand, Saint John wipes tears from his reddened eyes, and another woman covers her face so that the beholder is compelled to imagine her expression of sorrow.Simon Bening emphasized the scene's sad tone by setting it in the gloomy light of dusk. In looking through the book, the viewer would have certainly noted this dramatic darkness, for it dramatically contrasts with the bright light of the preceding full-pageminiatureofJoseph of Arimatheabefore Pilate.
In thisminiature, presented as though seen through the frame of an arched doorway, Christ's family and friends say their final goodbyes and place Christ's body in a tomb. Sadness fills the scene, evident not only in the faces of the mourners but also in the gray tones of the gloomygothicstructure. The stormy skies in the border of the facing page reinforce the somber effect.The tenderness with which the mourners treat Christ's body evokes a sympathetic response in the viewer. Devotional treatises of the period would have asked the reader to imagine the kind of details seen in the miniature: the man on the left lowering Christ's legs into the tomb, the woman behind him who kisses his hand one last time, and Saint John comforting the Virgin.
In contrast to the immediately preceding miniatures of the Passion, which were sorrowful in tone, this illumination ends Albrecht of Brandenburg's prayer book on a more hopeful note while continuing the Passion-based themes that run throughout most of the manuscript. A group of adoring angels and a crowd of people representing various classes--kings, clergy, aristocrats, and monks--regard the extraordinary vision of the five wounds of Christ set in the middle of vibrant pink and gold circles of light. In this scene, an unusual version of the Second Coming of Christ, the body that had been destroyed has become a symbol of power. Christ's wounds are no longer objects of sorrow but of reverence and awe.
In the center of theminiature, the Virgin sits on the ground with seven swords piercing her, each symbolizing one of the events related toChristthat brought her sorrow. The theme of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin was meant to draw the viewer into Mary's thoughts and feelings as she reflected on her son's life and death. Moving clockwise from the bottom right around the central image, smallnarrativescenes represent the seven episodes: thePresentation in the Temple, theFlight into Egypt, the Dispute in the Temple, the Way to Calvary, theCrucifixion, the Lamentation, and theEntombment.
At the bottom of the page,Mosesremoves his shoes to avoid defiling holy ground while gazing at God above in the burning bush. Because the burning bush was on fire but not consumed, Christians came to see this event as aprefigurationof Mary's conception ofChristwithout losing her virginity. Thus the image of the burning bush complements the accompanying text devoted to the birth of Christ and the image of theNativityon the facing page.
Prefiguring theNew Testamentscene of Christ's circumcision on the facing page, the border of this page presents Isaac's circumcision as recounted in theOld Testament. His father Abraham and two midwives lean over the newbornIsaacwhile Isaac's motherSarah, who had been childless until God intervened in her old age, rests in bed. At the top right, a panel set within sculptural tracery names the source, the book ofGenesis.  The smoke pouring from the chimney just below marks the transition between the cozy bedroom and the outdoors.The scene's spatial sophistication--combining both interior and exterior in one view--was one of the hallmarks ofFlemishpainting of the 1400s and the 1500s.
Surrounding the beginning of the text devoted to the Holy Name ofJesus, this border conveys the vastness of heaven and the divine power located in Christ's name. God the Father blesses at the top, while theHoly Spirithovers in the form of a dove in the middle of a group of angels directly below. The radiant circle of golden light representsChrist, the final member of the Trinity, with the Latin abbreviation of the name of Jesus,IHS.At the very bottom, a virtual sea of the blessed adores the Holy Name. Four demons lurk in the lower corners, cut off from the heavenly masses by deep blue clouds.
Intrigued by reports of King Solomon's legendary wisdom, the Queen of Sheba visits him in Jerusalem, kneeling down with two of her attendants to present him with sumptuous gold and spices. Simon Bening constructed the scene as if it were taking place behind a text-panel that discusses the story of the Adoration of theMagi. This image of the Queen and her handmaidens approaching the wise king with gifts echoes that of the three kings visiting the babyJesusseen on the facing page. Bening used this artistic strategy to help the viewer make the connection between theOld TestamentandNew Testamentstories of visiting royalty.
In the border,Hannahdedicates her sonSamuelto the Lord, fulfilling a vow she made to God when she was barren. Medieval Christians saw this incident as aprefigurationof the Presentation ofChrist, described in this text and pictured on the opposite page. The similar positions and clothing of the two priests emphasize the link between theOld TestamentandNew Testamentevents.
In the lower right corner, David's wife Michal lowers him out of a castle window as her father approaches the main gate with his army. Michal had fallen in love with the youngDavid, her father Saul's sworn enemy, and her father consequently tried to have David killed. Her cunning plan for David's escape saved his life. Christians saw a parallel between thisOld Testamentstory andJoseph, Mary, and Jesus'sFlight into Egypt, seen on the facing page.
To the right, Athaliah, mother of the recently deceased King of Judah, impassively watches soldiers slaughtering her sons' offspring so that she can become queen. The eventual restoration of the rightful ruler--a grandson who had escaped--brought an abrupt end to Athaliah's reign and her life. Medieval Christians often saw suchOld Testamentstories as prefigurations ofNew Testamentstories with similar themes. In this case, the text on the page concerns Herod's order to kill all the male children of Bethlehem younger than two years old in the hopes of murderingJesus. Theminiaturethat would have faced this page, removed from themanuscriptat some point in its history, surely depicted theMassacre of the Innocents.
Representatives of all the tribes of Israel surround theprophetSamuelas he puts forward Saul as king, saying,  Surely you can see him whom the Lord has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people.  (I Kings 10:24) Both this event from theOld Testamentand theNew Testamenttale of the Dispute in the Temple depicted on the facing page are scenes in which God has recognized wisdom and leadership through special selection. Thus, Christians saw a typological relationship between the stories.
Pursued by the Egyptian army up to the shores of the Red Sea,Mosesand the children of Israel gain safe passage when God opens a path through the waters for them. Theilluminationdepicts the moment when Moses and the Jews have reached safe ground and the waters close in after them on the doomed Egyptians. The border surrounds a prayer concerning the Baptism ofChristand faces aminiatureof the same subject, another famous biblical water scene.
In a peaceful landscape setting,Christsits in meditation during a self-imposed fast in the wilderness that lasted forty days and forty nights. The border surrounds a prayer concerning his fast and subsequent temptations, the subject of theminiatureon the facing page.
The widow of Sareptha kneels over the pitiful dead body of her young son while theprophetElijahcalls him back to life. In the distance at the right, the miraculously resurrected little boy departs with his mother, his hand clasped in hers. Simon Bening paired this joyousOld Testamentevent with a parallel event from theNew Testament, the Raising of Lazarus, on the facing page. The text discusses the power and obedience ofChrist, while the two images demonstrate the fulfillment of the Old Testament in the New Testament.
As the youngDavidreturns, victorious in battle and carrying the head of Goliath, beautifully dressed women emerge from an impressive castle playing musical instruments to greet him. Medieval Christians saw this episode, which marked the Israelites' triumph over the Philistines, as anOld Testamentprefigurationof Christ's Entry into Jerusalem, depicted on the facing page.
Abraham, in a sumptuously plumed helmet, triumphantly returns with his army to Salem after rescuing his nephew from captivity. Melchizedek, king of Salem, greets him at the city gates and offers him bread and wine in honor of his victory. Christians interpreted this event as anOld Testamentprefigurationof the Last Supper, which appears on the opposite page. At the Last Supper,Christhad offered bread and wine to his disciples, telling them that it was his flesh and blood.
While two dogs playfully romp behind him, Abraham, the founder of the Hebrew nation, kneels down towashthe feet of three angels who appear to him at his home. His gesture of humility echoes the actions ofChristwhen he washed the feet of his apostles, a story honored in the prayer on this page and depicted on the facing page.
Passing merchants pull the youngJosephfrom the well into which his jealous brothers had thrown him to get rid of him. Though they mercifully free Joseph from the well, the merchants rescue him only to sell him into slavery. Laden camels wait nearby to transport him to Egypt. Simon Bening paired the story of Joseph'sbetrayalby his brothers with Judas's betrayal ofChriston the facing page.
With the pitiful corpses of his countrymen lying in a valley beneath him,Davidaddresses God directly with a heart-felt plea to punish him and his family instead of the population at large:  I am the one who has sinned, I have done wrong: these who are the sheep, what have they done  I entreat you to turn your hand against me and against my father's house.  (2Samuel24:17) On the facing page,Christin a similar manner accepts the sacrifice of his own life in exchange for remission of the world's sins.
Having asked Abner, the commander of King Saul's army, to meet him in front of the gate to Hebron for a private conference, Joab, commander of King David's army, treacherously stabs him in the back. Although theBiblestates that Joab stabbed Abner from the front, Simon Bening placed the two men almost in an embrace, with Joab reaching behind Abner to kill him, emphasizing his deceit. Thecompositionthus directly echoes Judas's betraying kiss seen on the opposite page, linking the Old andNew Testamentstories.
Guarded by soldiers, Achior unwillingly follows his captors to the besieged city of Bethulia. According to thisOld Testamentstory, Achior eventually converted to the Jewish faith after the Jews of Bethulia took him in and treated him well. The image of Achior bound and with a rope around his neck echoes the depiction of thearrestofChristseen on the facing page, an artistic strategy used to help the viewer make the connection between the Old andNew Testamentevents.
Departing from the artistic convention of showing a scene from theOld Testamenttypologically related to the facingminiature, this border containsillusionisticarchitecture and figures unrelated to anynarrative. The text describes the abandonment ofChristand the flight of the apostles.
King Ahab stands on the porch of a great palace listening in dismay as theprophetMicaiah foretells his defeat and death in a forthcoming battle. Angry with Micaiah's prophesy, the king chose to believe the words of the prophets who told him what he wanted to hear, that he would succeed. Before going off to the battle, where he was indeed killed, Ahab threw Micaiah in jail. Simon Bening paired this scene of a righteous man condemned for speaking the truth with the similar story ofChristbefore Annas, depicted on the facing page.
Facing the dramatically powerful image of the Denial ofSaint Peter, this page contains a meditational text. Like the facing image, the text focuses on the portion of the Passionnarrativein which Peter denies three times that he knowsJesus. AnHin the form of a broken branch introduces the beginning of the German text,Herr Iesu Chris[t]e(The Lord JesusChrist). Various plants, flowers, birds, and insects occupy the border, which completely surrounds the text. The artist's skillful depiction of the natural objects, with shadows beneath them as if they were present on the surface of the page, imparts a three-dimensional quality to the image.
In the lower right corner of this border, the JewishprophetJeremiah predicts before the King of Judah that ill will befall all the cities of Judah if the people do not obey the law of God. When the other priests and prophets threaten to kill him for his words, Jeremiah explains that if they do, they will be shedding innocent blood, for he was sent by God to speak to them. This scene of judgment taken from theOld Testamentfaces a similar event from theNew Testament,ChristbeforeCaiaphas.
An unidentifiedOld Testamentprince or king sits in profile holding a long staff and wearing a pointed hat, underlining his similarity toPontius Pilate, who appears with the same trappings in a similar position on the facing page. Theprophet, standing before the throne to be judged, is bound in the same manner asChriston the facing page. By showing the individuals in similar costumes and poses, Simon Bening visually emphasized the analogy between the story of this Old Testament prophet and Christ's meeting with Pilate in theNew Testament.
The border of this page consists of painting designed to appear as golden architecture set against a redbackground. Delicate tracerywork creates niches for a series ofillusionisticsculptures. The border frames a text that discusses the wayChristwas scorned and mocked beforeHerod, the subject of theilluminationon the facing page.
A pattern of pearls and gems set in precious metalwork decorates the border of this text page devoted to the story ofChristbeing led toHerod. On the right, Veronica holds up her veil with its miraculous image of Christ's face. The image was created when she used the cloth to wipe the sweat from his face as he carried the cross to the site of theCrucifixion. Below, the artist presents the image of Christ as the Lamb of God, a symbol meant to arouse the beholder's sympathy when contrasted with Christ's humiliation in the facingminiature.
Stripped naked, mocked by his wife, whipped by devils, and confronted with the destruction of his worldly goods by fire,Jobstill sits patiently on a dungheap, trusting in the will of God. Satan had challenged God to see whether Job, a devout man blessed with wealth, good health, and a loving family, would remain faithful after a series of trials. After killing Job's livestock and servants, sending a plague of boils to cover him from head to foot, and having a house fall on all his children, Satan was convinced that Job would curse God, just as his wife urges him to do in theillumination. Job refuses and responds that, just as God has the power to give good things, God may also give evil. Christians saw Job's patience as a parallel to the endurance ofChristduring his Passion, including the Flagellation scene on the facing page.
Crowned but barefoot, KingDavidflees from the invading army of his son, only to be stoned by Shimei, an old man who favored the previous king. David's persecution and loneliness mirror those ofChristduring his trials, seen on the facing page. The text on this page discusses Christ's stripping, mocking, andcrowning with thorns.
At the bottom right corner of this border, theprophetZechariahlooks up at a vision of Satan assailing the high priest Joshua. Medieval commentators saw a parallel between theOld Testamentstory of the priest Joshua and Jesus' plight as described in theNew Testament. Simon Bening expressed this parallel visually by having Joshua--also unfairly accused--stand next to Satan just asJesusstands next to Pilate in the facingminiature.
An angry mob approaches the palace of King Cyrus to demand that theprophetDanielbe thrown into the lions' den as punishment for killing a dragon that the people had worshipped as a god. The king, having been accused of turning against his own people to become a Jew, gives in to the crowd and delivers Daniel. Medieval Christians saw the reluctant Cyrus turning a righteous man over to seemingly certain death as anOld Testamentprefigurationof theNew Testamentstory of Pilate andJesus, seen on the facing page.
Against the backdrop of a beautiful atmospheric landscape, Abraham, a sword tucked under his arm, urges his sonIsaacto precede him up the mountain. In order to test Abraham's faith, God had ordered him to sacrifice his only son, an action stopped by an angel at the last moment. Medieval Christians often saw Isaac's sacrifice as anOld Testamentprefigurationof the story ofChrist, whose journey to Calvary appears in the facingminiature. Simon Bening underlined the parallel by showing Isaac in a position similar to Christ's, carrying on his shoulder the wood that will complete his sacrifice just as Christ carries his cross.
The emotional power of theCrucifixionon the opposite page complements the dramatic tone of the meditational text on this page. Arubricin red ink introduces the contents of the reading:Von der blossen kretzigu[n]g und hoher auffhenckung an das Creutz des herren Iesu(Of the stark Crucifixion and the hanging of LordJesushigh on the cross). The fact that theprayer bookis written in German rather than Latin reflects the increasing acceptance of thevernacularas an appropriate language for texts, both literary and sacred.Simon Bening surrounded the text with anillusionisticframe, as if the words were painted on a tangible wooden panel. The words on a small hanging sign to the right identify the biblical passage (Genesis22) that tells the story of the Sacrifice ofIsaac, the scene shown in the border below. TheOld Testamentstory of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, at the Lord's command was understood as aprefigurationof God's sacrifice of his only son, seen in the Crucifixion on the opposite page. Bening set the scene within a deep, continuous landscape that is only visible in the border, as if the text panel were blocking the observer's view.
Flowers and insects painted as though they were real objects resting on a gold ground decorate this border, surrounding a textual meditation onChristand facing an image of the Man of Sorrows.Flemishmanuscriptsof the later 1400s and the 1500s commonly featured such borders.
Flowers and insects depicted as if strewn on top of a colored ground decorate this border and those of many other Flemishmanuscriptsfrom the early 1500s. This text, devoted to the tablet bearing Christ's name that was attached to the cross, faces a scene of angels presenting the tablet to the viewer.
After speaking out against God, the Israelites were plagued with serpents, seen here in the lower border as vicious reptiles crawling over the bodies of three men. WhenMosesasked God what he could do to remedy the situation, he was told to make a bronze image of a serpent and set it on a pole; this image then had a miraculous power to cure those suffering from snakebites.Christlinked the story of Moses and the serpent to his own eventualcrucifixion, saying,  As Moses raised the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be raised.  (John 3:14) Following this understanding of theOld Testamentstory as aprefigurationof the Crucifixion, Simon Bening paired this border with an image of the Crucifixion on the facing page.
Butterflies, thistles, insects, and an alert squirrel examining a nut decorate this border surrounding a text devoted to the virtues and sorrows of the Virgin. The thistles seem to hover in front of the shimmering gold ground, castingillusionisticshadows below.
Magnificently clothed in red robes and a three-tiered crown, God calls forth Eve in the idyllic setting of the Garden of Eden. Christian commentators associated Eve's emergence from Adam's side with Christ's side being pierced by a lance, discussed in the text on this page and pictured on the facingfolio.
A variety of lively birds, insects, and colorful flowers decorates this border, which surrounds a text devoted to the story ofJoseph of Arimatheaasking for the body ofChrist. The objects seem to hover in front of the shimmering gold ground, casting shadows below.
Echoing Mary's feelings at the death of her son in the facingminiature, theOld Testamentfigure of Naomi kneels on the ground in grief before the bodies of her husband and two sons. The Book of Ruth begins with this story of Naomi being widowed and her two sons dying after they leave Bethlehem. Naomi returns to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law Ruth and tells the people there not to call her Naomi, which means beautiful, but Mara, which means bitter. Her words are recorded in gold paint in the red square at the right.
A text discussing the Five Wounds ofChristfaces a picture of those wounds being venerated. Some scholars consider the monogram in gold on a red field to the lower right to be the initials of the artist, Simon Bening, appropriately found on the lastilluminatedpage. In the upper right, an elaborate golden pedestal supports a statue of the Virgin and Child. By alluding to the beginning of Christ's life, this subject complements the facing scene, which makes reference to the end of his life. In this way, the final opening encompasses the entire life of Christ, which is the subject matter of the book.
Rough winds play havoc with two ships under a threatening dark sky asJonahis pushed overboard into the gaping maw of a large fish. The sailors cast him out because they blamed him for the stormy seas. Jonah remained in the belly of the fish for three days, praying to God. On the third day, God spoke to the fish, which vomited out the poor man. Because three days separated the death andresurrectionofChrist, Christians saw this story as a typological parallel to theEntombmentof Christ, discussed in the text on this page and depicted in the facingminiature.
TheOld Testamentjudge and warrior Gideon kneels in the bottom corner, watching as the fleece he has laid on the ground receives rain from an angel. In order to determine by sign whether or not God would deliver Israel, Gideon had proposed to God that the wetting of the fleece while the ground around it remained dry would signify God's promise of action. Christians came to see this event as aprefigurationof theAnnunciation, when God again delivered humanity, this time throughChrist. This page faces themanuscript'sAnnunciationminiature, and its text focuses on the subject of God's redemption of humanity. In both images, Simon Bening used golden rays of light to represent divine intervention.
While celebrating mass, Pope Gregory prayed for a way to convince doubters that Christ was truly present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist. His prayers were granted when the crucified body of Christ miraculously appeared on the altar, bleeding directly into the chalice. In this miniature depicting the vision, the viewer is invited to share in Gregory's experience by peering over his shoulder.
This leaf from the Munich-Montserrat Hours depicts the first attempt to kill Saint Sebastian. The emperor Diocletian, who ordered the saint's execution, watches from horseback as his soldiers mercilessly shoot arrows at Sebastian. Although the saint miraculously survived the ordeal, he was eventually beaten to death. The saint's stance here--tied to a column and defenseless--purposefully recalls traditional images of Christ's flagellation, when Jesus was tied to a column and beaten.The detailed yet expansive landscape seen in the background was one of the hallmarks of Simon Bening's late style.
Simon Bening painted this pair ofminiaturesback-to-back on a single leaf of abook of hours. The miniatures originally appeared at the bottom of two calendar pages that listed church holidays. Each page was devoted to a particular month, and each miniature depicts an activity associated with the month. In these miniatures, Bening showed that landscape backgrounds, with their distinctive weather conditions, could be even more evocative of a particular month than the activities themselves.Despite their small size, the scenes are as ambitious in scope andcompositionas independent paintings of considerably larger dimensions. Admiring these scenes as independent paintings, a previous owner of thecuttingframed it and hung it on the wall like any other landscape painted on canvas or wood.
As the local parish church prepares for services, villagers and rural peasants make their way down the path. In the distance, fields, gently rolling hills, buildings, and groves of trees give shape to the landscape. The candlelit procession inside the church, as well as the candles held by the approaching villagers, suggest the celebration of Candlemas, a church holiday observed the second of February.An earlier owner probably cut theminiaturefrom the lower border of the calendar of abook of hours. Despite its small size, Bening's landscape achieves a monumentality associated with larger contemporary panel paintings, where thegenreof landscape painting was developing along similar lines.
TwoFlemishpeasants gather sticks into bundles before a landscape of rolling hills, rural homes, and a river. The trees have lost their leaves, the sky is overcast, and the men are warmly dressed, suggesting winter. In addition, the activity of clearing away dead wood was traditionally a wintertime activity.This smallcuttingfrom the lower border of amanuscriptpage originally served as an illustration in the calendar section of abook of hours. The seasonal character of the landscape suggests that it was associated with one of the winter months. The expansive landscape and the description of atmosphere are characteristic of the art of Simon Bening, who worked in the first half of the 1500s, when landscape painting emerged as an independentgenreof art in easel paintings.
This cabinet was one of a pair delivered in 1788 for the bedroom of Louis XVI at the chteau of Saint-Cloud. From a memoir written in the same year giving a detailed description of both cabinets, scholars know that both were originally veneered with panels of Japanese lacquer cut from a screen. The document lists in detail not only the names of most of the artisans who worked on the cabinet, but also the cost of each part--an unusual and fascinating detail. From this document, researchers learned that the most expensive part of this piece was the elaborately chased and gilded mounts, which show symbols of the king.At some point in the early 1800s, someone replaced the lacquer panels withpietre dure(hardstone) plaques. The companion piece, now in the Royal Palace in Madrid, has been changed too; marquetry panels showing harbor scenes replaced the original lacquer.The mounts were cast by tienne-Jean Forestier and Denis Bardin. They were chased by Pierre-Philippe Thomire and gilt by Claude Galle.
Henry Hamilton Bennett ran his photography studio with the assistance of his family. He photographed himself with three of his children in the drawing room, which conspicuously displays two paintings and a sculpture of what appears to be a Civil War subject. The inclusion of the fine arts in an otherwise sparsely furnished room with worn floors and plain walls shows the importance of art to Bennett and this photographer's desire to align himself with the traditional arts.A painted landscape hangs on the wall directly above Bennett's head. He was a committed landscape photographer and land conservationist, so his symbolic placement under this image hints at his ambitions and interests. Furthering the connection between aesthetic contemplation and Bennett's profession, the daughter seated next to him seems to be perusing a photograph album, emphasizing both family unity and professional affirmation.
This secrtaire is designed in a rigidly architectonic style composed ofclassicalelements such as columns,pilasters, and a cupola. The panel in the midsection lowers to reveal drawers and pigeonholes designed as small rooms, withparquetrywalls and floors in many different naturally colored woods. Concealed above the fall front is a reading stand; below are drawers that can be rotated outwards.The interior of the secrtaire where the wood has been protected from daylight is pale yellow. This means that the cabinet has darkened considerably over time; with its pale woodveneer, white marble plaques, andgilding, it would have seemed much less somber. The secrtaire once had a large musical movement inside its base, which played a tune when the clock struck the hour.
With convincingnaturalism, a cow turns its head to survey a group of figures resting above a crevice on a hillside. Thesatyrsleeps with his head on the lap of anymph, and a young child playfully tugs at her arm. Cows and sheep rest around the family, completing the image of peaceful tranquility in thisarcadianlandscape. On the right side of the painting, trees grow at different angles on a rocky hillside sloping diagonally down toward a crevice or dry creek bed. In the far distance, hazy mountains give way to a light-blue sky with grayish-white clouds.Nicolaes Berchem was fond of depicting idylls in imaginary Italian settings. The foliage and hilly landscape identify the location as typical of northern Italy, not Holland. Here he used a vertical format and suggested movement through the diagonals of the hillside and leaning trees. Framed by the large open expanse on the left, the standing cow, rather than the family group in theforeground, captures the viewer's attention.
A man and woman lead their herd across a shimmering ford. The woman has already entered the shallow water and hikes up her skirt. A hefty cow tentatively dips its front hooves into the water. The hatted herdsman brings up the rear with a long stick in his hand. The group's movement is anchored around a pair of large trees that cross at the center of the composition.Nicolaes Berchem liberally applied brown wash to the figures, animals, and central trees. Pools of wash in the foreground water evoke cast shadows. Behind the group, layers of gray wash contrast with the white paper to convey raking, midday sunlight. On top of the gray wash, Berchem's sketchy use of pen and brown ink suggest slightly rugged foliage.During the mid-1600s, Berchem was one of the most popular Dutch artists working in anItalianatestyle. This drawing does not feature any typical Italianmotifs, like columns or ruins, but the sun-drenched scene suggests an idyllic Mediterranean setting. In the century after Berchem's death, collectors across Europe sought out these pastoral views. To meet the continued demand for his work, engravings were made after his drawings; this sheet was incised to be made into a print.
In the rustic courtyard of an Italian inn, a huntsman on a white horse, and several of his companions, refresh themselves. A multitude of hounds rest in the shadows; and the prize of the hunt, a deer, lies in the right foreground. Two huntsmen converse with a hostess-- perhaps regaling her with tales from the day's chase. On the balcony above, a washerwoman sets out laundry. At left, partly shrouded in shade, a woman serves two seated men. Above this trio, two pairs of tiny figures explore the upper reaches of the towering ruin behind the inn.Nicolaes Berchem is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. In these panoramic paintings, figures generally play a secondary role. By contrast, inThe Return From the Hunt, Berchem focused on the interaction between figures and architectural setting rather than the landscape. The unusual vertical format showcases the artist's command of light. Light falling on the mounted horseman also illuminates the woman on the balcony as well as the figures on the left.Hunters at rest was a popular subject among northern genre painters in the 1600s. In this painting, the pose of the man in blue, seen from the rear, quotes a well-known ancient sculpture of Hercules. Berchem may have seen this sculpture in person or copied it after an engraving.
This miniature scene is cleverly composed to display both a vast sense of space, and a detailed view of life on the frozen canals. In the background, at right, the faraway towers of the Hague are visible. In the middle ground, wealthy citizens take sleigh rides, and line up to buy hot drinks from a vendor. In contrast with this, and the assorted frolicking dogs and children, the foreground features peasants hard at work cutting wood. Artist Jan Berents also creates atmospheric perspective with the considered placement of trees, flag poles, and church towers. At the base of the image, Berents adds his signature, and a reference to his unusual dual career as a mathematician.This work is part of a long tradition of Dutch genre scenes. In particular, Berents' detailed landscape evokes those by an earlier Netherlandish artist, Pieter Bruegel. Much like Bruegel's figures, Berents' skaters have a somewhat comical air about them due to the extra long blades on their ice skates. Furthermore, his use of vellum, or fine-grained animal skin, his stippled technique, and the detailed portrayal of the winter season all evoke the work of the renowned Flemish miniature painter, Simon Bening.
In this hunting trophy painting, Christoffel van den Berghe saw the dead birds as opportunities to inventively orchestrate a variety of textures, patterns, and shapes. He not only showcased the birds' colorful feathers, but he complemented them with his entire still-life repertoire: fruit, flowers, and serving pieces.Thegenreof  game pieces  generally dates from the 1640s; this is one of the earliest in the history of Dutch art. Few Dutch artists painted such works, perhaps because the market was small. Hunting and shooting were not practiced on a large scale in the northern Netherlands, and these paintings were not commissioned.
This image is an enlarged still from one of Ella Bergmann-Michel's films. She was associated with theavant-gardegroupsdas neue frankfurtandLiga fr den unabhngigen Film(Independent Film League) in the early 1930s and made several social documentary films. This tree study is more experimental in nature than her films, subtly portraying the subject from an unconventional angle suspended in a fleeting moment in time.
When he was less than twenty years old, Gian Lorenzo Bernini carved this marble boy with a dragon for the palace of Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII. Even at this young age, Bernini was such a skilled marble sculptor that he could differentiate the textures of pudgy flesh, soft hair, waves of water, and dragon scales. A hole in the dragon's mouth shows that the sculpture was used as a fountain.The infant Hercules, who demonstrated his divine strength even as an infant by slaying poisonous serpents, appears here as a mischievous boy who smiles, sits on the dragon, and breaks its jaw with his bare hands. Common in Hellenistic statuary, the theme of Hercules and the serpent was revived in sculpture of the early 1600s. Bernini probably based the composition of his work on an antique work, but contemporary concerns also played a role. He may have represented the serpent as a dragon because his patron, Barberini, wished to convey a satirical message about another important Roman patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, whose family coat of arms included a dragon.
Neptune, Roman god of the sea, stands astride a dolphin on a bed of waves, lunging forward with his trident into the viewer's space. His unruly hair and beard and the billowing drapery that winds around his muscled figure evoke the sense of a whipping wind over the ocean. The flattened planes with which the sculptor modeled the muscles on the chest, arms, and legs heighten the feel of strength in the figure's movements. His intense focus on an unseen object before him adds a menacing tone. This drama of physicality and motion is characteristic of the Baroque style.The tabletop bronze is a reduced variant of a marble fountain sculpture made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini around 1620 for the garden of the great collector and patron, Cardinal Montalto, in Rome. All of the four known versions in bronze include a long-bodied dolphin between Neptune's legs, replacing the figure of a triton who served as a supportive strut on the marble statue. Reductions in bronze are unusual in Roman sculpture of the time; the multiple reproductions of Neptune are probably due to the celebrity of its maker, who dominated Roman sculptural production in the seventeenth century.
Unlike Gian Lorenzo Bernini's usual polished portraits, this study of an unidentified man is a free, spontaneous characterization. Bernini drew the young man with great liveliness, ease, and even looseness, especially in the shirt collar. By depicting the man gazing directly out with boldness and animation, Bernini created an active exchange between sitter and viewer, just as he did in his sculpture.Bernini rarely used red chalk without black. Here he added small amounts of white chalk, giving luminosity and greater substance to the image as if the nose, lips, chin, and collar were reflecting a natural light source.
Tilting backwards on a perilous pile of rocks, a marine god wrestles with the dolphin perched on the figure's shoulders. Quick, curving lines and rough shading fill the drawing with vibrant movement: the dolphin in particular seethes with energy. Gian Lorenzo Bernini swiftly outlined the shapes of the rock formations as well as the marine god and dolphin. Using some blunt tool, perhaps even a thumb or finger, he softly smudged the lines to create the shadows that form the contorted pose of the god's muscular torso. Between 1652 and 1653, Bernini sent studies for fountains to Duke Francesco I d'Este for his palace. Other craftsmen transferred this particular design into a terracotta model, and then local, less accomplished workers produced a more static stucco fountain for the central niche of the palace.
Thisplein air(made outdoors) oil sketch by Jean-Victor Bertin captures the graceful curve of a sunlit bridge on the outskirts of a French village in the early 1800s. A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio. This sketch was meant to inform those polished yet imaginary landscapes, making them more convincing to the eye.
Beside a fountain on an outdoor stone terrace, Psyche is groomed by her attendants. Two maids stand behind Psyche and dress her hair. A large mirror reflects her face and one of her attendants. To the left of the mirror, an attendant appears transfixed by Psyche's beauty; another displays a length of pink silk fabric. At the right edge, a seated attendant sorts flowers and converses with a maid who carries powder and perfume on a silver tray. Psyche is probably being prepared for her first night with her new husband,Cupid.Nicolas Besnier, a silversmith and co-director of the Beauvais manufactory, probably advised Boucher on the trio of elaborate silver objects in the foreground--a large pitcher, basin, and tray.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
With arms outstretched, a despairing Psyche gazes upward at the departing figure ofCupid, who arches his back in flight against gray clouds. A trio of naiads, or waternymphs, witness the event, their eyes following Cupid's aerial departure. As Cupid leaves Psyche, she finds herself in a remote and stony wilderness, its lack of hospitality tempered only by the source of a spring whose cascading water becomes a stream.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
Love-struckCupidhas had beautiful Psyche brought to his opulent palace. Amid billowing clouds, Psyche enters the sun-drenched residence, although Cupid himself is not there. She is escorted byZephyr, the butterfly-winged god of the west wind. Psyche walks on aNear Easterncarpet that has been unrolled to receive her. Clusters of languid attendants play music, arrange flowers, or simply admire Psyche's dramatic entrance.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.
A bearded man, the godPan, assists a disheveled Psyche down an earthen path in a wooded vale. They approach two seated women--the goddessCeres, her right arm outstretched, and her daughterProserpine. The two goddesses are surrounded by sheaves of wheat and wicker baskets. In the lower left corner, a nanny goat, one of Pan's attributes, seems to look toward its master. At the top of the tapestry, set into the expansive sky, is agiltcartouche bearing the royalcoat of armsof France and the Kingdom of Navarre (a region of southwest Europe).Either Jean-Baptiste Oudry or Andr Charlemagne Charron also assisted with this tapestry.
At the left,Saint Peterand other disciples ofChristpull their teeming nets of fish aboard a boat. After an unsuccessful night of fishing on the Sea of Tiberius, the tired and hungry disciples had seen a man standing on the shore and followed his advice to cast their nets over the boat's right side. Their miraculous catch inspired Peter to recognize Christ, appearing after his death andResurrection; in the middle scene, Peter enters the water to meet him. On the right, Christ and the disciples share a meal around a fire. Theforegrounddepicts peasants hauling in baskets of fish to take to the market, forming a contemporary parallel to the biblical scene.Joachim Beuckelaer specialized in combininggenresubjects with religious scenes. InThe Miraculous Draught of Fishes,he contrasted the spiritual world of theBiblewith the materialism of the contemporary world.
To save their people from destruction by the advancing army of the Israelites, three Gibeonite men gather in theforegroundto plead with Joshua. They lie to him, displaying their old food, ripped wine sacks, and tattered clothing, in a ploy to convince him that they are wandering tribes that should be allowed to stay in the Promised Land of Israel. When Joshua learns that he has been tricked--in fact the Gibeonites lived there permanently--he condemned them to perpetual servitude.Joachim Beuckelaer used a dark,grisaillepaletteof brown and gray oils to emphasize the Gibeonites' treachery. Black strokes outline the figures and loosely define the men's faces, flags, and clothing. Beuckelaer also organized the picture by dividing it in half: a diagonal line begins from the leaning tree in the top left corner and continues down, with the Gibeonites ranged on one side and the Israelites on the other. The Gibeonites cluster in the foreground, while the sketchily drawn army of Israelites gathers in thebackground, mostly faceless figures in a crowd of waving spears.
Drawn from theOld Testament, a series of continuousnarrativesdepicts episodes from the life ofJoseph, the favorite son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob. To make the story easier to follow, Biagio d'Antonio included inscriptions identifying the principal characters.In the left-hand loggia, Jacob, seated on a throne, sends Joseph to his half-brothers tending sheep in the field. In the far left corner, the brothers, jealous of their father's love for Joseph, strip him of his jacket and throw him into a pit. Passing merchants purchase the young boy from his brothers for twenty pieces of silver. In thebackgroundto the right, the merchants board the ship that will take them and their cargo to Egypt. In the right-hand loggia, the brothers show a blood-smeared coat to their father as evidence that Joseph is dead. With his head in his hand, Jacob mourns his son, whom he believes to be dead.A companion panel in the Metropolitan Museum of Art depicts the next sequence of events in Joseph's life. Originally framed next to one another, these two panels would have been inserted into the paneling of a room in a Tuscan family's home.
Jean Joseph-Xavier Bidauld painted this landscape while on a five-year sojourn in Italy, where he developed his distinct style by making studies directly from nature. This southern Italian view encompasses many features common in his work; a stretch of fertile terrain, picturesque architecture, a source of water, and a majestic, craggy mountain in the distance. Silvery morning light dances across the undulating planes, rendered in soft blues, greens, and browns, and highlighted with autumnal yellows. The extraordinary freshness and precision that characterizes this painting conveys the immediacy of nature's impression on Bidauld, and explains why, upon hearing his name, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was moved to exclaim:  Bidauld! Ah! But gently, now, he wasn't just anybody, he was at times truly a master, and one of the finest. Certain of his small canvases are masterpieces, and full of fine example and sound counsel for all of us, young and old alike. 
Director of the Hamburg Bank from 1843 to 1876, Hermann Carl Eduard Biewend was an early, influential amateur daguerreotypist in Germany. Trained as a chemist, he created numerous portraits of his family and friends, as well as landscapes and architectural views.The casual and confident expressions of the photographer's wife and children reveal their intimate relationship. All of the faces are slightly blurred. Helene and the children would have had to sit perfectly still for upwards of thirty seconds. Their easy composure contrasts with the severe-looking protrusion that appears above their heads, which Biewend has spared them: such head clamps were commonly used devices for keeping sitters still during long exposures.
Twogiltsilver stags with large antlers majestically pose on elaborate tiered bases with a pedestal. Probably originally designed as table ornaments, either facing or turning away from a large ornament or asurtout de tableused during banquets at a hunting lodge, they brought the outdoors into the elaborate dining rituals of the court. Raising their heads and perking up their ears, the animals stand at the alert on a surfaceembossedto resemble a forest floor littered with leaves, twigs, and stumps of grass.Johann Ludwig Biller the Elder, a German silversmith who worked for the royal courts of Northern Europe, used a sand-casting technique to make the stags, modeling the pieces in sections and then adding finelytooleddetails.
The young Saint Catherine, one of the most popular medieval saints, bends forward from the left to receive a wedding ring from theChristchild, who nearly twists off a bench in front of his mother Mary. Dating from the late Middle Ages, the story of Catherine'smystical marriageto Christ became a popular subject for both Italian and Northern European artists.Bartolomeo Biscaino displayed his animated draftsmanship in broad patches of light and shade, expressive gestures of faces and hands, and elaborate, flowing outlines. To give thecompositioneven more immediacy, he cropped the figures on the left side. He added the shadows and contours in red chalk and freely applied thick, white gouache to createhighlights. The range of tones from dark to light uses the paper's tan color as the middle tone between the red and white.
The sons of Niobe, queen of Thebes, flee from the arrows aimed down at them from a cloud by the Greek deitiesApolloand Diana. Horses trample the bodies of the dead and dying, while two other sons throw up their hands imploringly on the left. In the story from Ovid'sMetamorphoses,Apollo and Diana killed Niobe's seven sons and seven daughters to punish her for being too arrogant.Jan de Bisschop conveyed the scene's drama through energetic motion and repetition. Using a characteristically Baroque, sweeping horizontal composition, he interwove human figures and horses into a tangledfriezethat moves from left to right. An inscription on the back of the drawing shows that the artist based the scene on an antique relief. To create an almost sculptural, two-dimensional impression, de Bisschop used a strong mixture of black chalk and brownwash, creating highlights by letting the bare paper show through.
The Great Boston Fire began on the evening of November 9, 1872, in the city's business district and burned through the following afternoon. As photographer James Wallace Black remarked shortly thereafter,  [F]or the past week I have had hardly time to take a breath, such has been the call for photographs of the burnt district.  Indeed, Black was out photographing even though the fire gravely threatened his own livelihood, stopping literally across the street from his studio on Washington Street.These haunting ruins stood on the east side of Pearl Street at the south corner of Pearl Place looking towards Broad Street. The view was taken soon after the fire, before officials denied spectators access to the burned areas. The assembly of men amidst the rubble wearing overcoats and ties, some even sporting top hats, appear as though they have just arrived to work, only to discover that the various  & Co.'s,  whose nameplates are still visible on the corner bricks, are no more.
In a series of articles published inThe Philadelphia Photographer,an anonymous observer remarked:  There is no subject, probably, more fascinating to the lover of the picturesque than ruins of every description.  Scenes of destruction such as these presented a rare opportunity for American photographers, who did not have ready access to the ruined pictorial splendor of their European counterparts. Perhaps the greatest irony was that the buildings that turned so quickly and thoroughly into ruins worthy ofPompeiior Rome were themselves modeled on European structures, though constructed of less durable materials.The photographs that James Wallace Black made of the fire in Boston's financial district were made into a photographic album titledRuins of the Great Fire in Boston, November 1872.Here Black created a panoramic overview of the district, still smoldering from the inferno.
Greek vases created in the colonies often illustrated themes of local interest. This fragment of a bell-krater made inApuliain South Italy depicts Scylla, a monster who personified the terrors of the sea and was believed to live in the straits between Sicily and the toe of Italy. Scylla, who grabbed sailors off their ships and devoured them, was a hybrid creature, having a woman's upper body, a fishy lower body, and a ring of dogs' heads around her waist. The survival of only a small fragment makes it difficult to determine what is happening on this vase. The dolphins at the lower edge suggest that Scylla is swimming in the sea. Above her head, a section of a wing and a garment decorated with stars, which are part of another mythological figure, are visible. Just in front of Scylla, the chest and hooves of a bull are preserved. The vase may have depicted the myth of the rape ofEuropa, in whichZeusturns himself into a white bull and carries the princess off across the sea. This tale was very popular in the Greek colonies in Italy. Scylla may here have been just another creature populating the sea in such a scene.
The story of the mortal virgin Kallisto and her son Arkas decorates this small chous, or wine jug.  On the front of the jug, Kallisto sits on a rock covered with animal skins. Willowy trees surround her, creating a woodland setting. According to myth, Kallisto spent her time in theArcadianMountains of Greece as a favorite hunting companion ofArtemis, goddess of the hunt and childbirth. The king of the Greek gods,Zeus, was attracted to Kallisto and seduced her, which resulted in the birth of a son, Arkas, who gave his name to the area of Greece known as Arcadia. Enraged with jealously,Hera, Zeus's wife, changed Kallisto into a bear. On this chous, Kallisto already has the animal's pointed ears, hairy arms, and paws. She wears hunting boots and her hunting spears are propped against the rock at the left.Moving to the right on the jug, baby Arkas sits on the ground but is being pulled into the arms ofHermes, the messenger god. Hermes wears his traditional costume of a traveling hat and cloak. His special wand, the kerykeion, rests against a stone marker behind him. Hermes is going to transport the soon-to-be-orphaned baby to his own mother, Maia, who will raise Arkas on Mount Kyllene in Arcadia.In one version of the myth, Arkas later joins his mother Kallisto among the stars as parts of the constellations of the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper.
Satan hovers in malevolent glory over Eve, who is entwined by his alter ego, the serpent of the Garden of Eden. The uneven, fibrous, opaque color of the ground under Eve distinguishes this area as printed, while the even sweep of the red washes shows that the flames behind Satan are mostly watercolor, a medium William Blake often used because he liked its transparent quality.Blake's images reflected his own very personal visions, which he insisted were  not a cloudy vapour or a nothing; they are organized and minutely articulated beyond all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce.  The twelve large, color-printed drawings that he created in 1795 rank among his most complex works. To achieve the effects he envisioned, poet-painter Blake invented an innovative three-step process: 1) drawing the image with thick, sticky watercolors on a piece of stiff paper board; 2) stamping the sticky image on paper; and 3) working over the resulting print in watercolor washes and pen and ink. No more than three variants of each image are known to survive, each one unique.
Charles Marville photographed this snow-covered area along the River Seine while it was being used as a building depot. Piles of paving stones for new roads line the water's edge, and larger blocks lie near the ramp that leads upward to the top of the embankment. This early image reflects Marville's interest in documentary photography, which became his specialty after the city of Paris commissioned him to photograph the roads scheduled for demolition byNapoleon III'sarchitect and city planner, Georges-Eugne, Baron Haussman.
More than a document, this is a portrait of a tree, centered within the frame, with its presence dominating the landscape. The branches cut off at the top of the frame seem to magically reappear as the tree that peeks up from a lower bank of the river, a smooth expanse of white in themiddle ground. The arched outline of a bridge is barely detectable in the far distance as Louis Dsir Blanquart-Evrard celebrated the beauty of the simple, natural subject. The rough wooden legs of an unidentifiable structure intruding into the picture lend a touch of spontaneity to the scene.
Under a lavish, tasseled canopy, the godsMarsandVenusmake love on a bed surrounded by flyingputticarrying decorative bunches of fruit. Mars, the god of war, has thrown down his elaborate shield and feathered helmet at the foot of the bed, while a putto plays with his sword. A fifth putto peers around the curtain to observe the adulterers.Abraham Bloemaert used the body of Venus as the drawing's central feature. As she curves around Mars, her body forms a grand diagonal sweep that flows up through the drawing, leading the viewer's eye up to the top of the canopy. Bloemaert's deft handling of his materials and his technique give the scene immediacy and vigor. By varying the length and the curve of the same strokes of parallel hatching, he indicated both the lighting and the volume of the forms. The whitebodycolorheightening adds to the sense of animation.The high degree of finish suggests to scholars that Bloemaert made this drawing as a model for an engraving that was never completed or as a presentation sheet for apatron.
Abraham Bloemaert drew the weathered boards, crumbling bricks, and sagging thatch in loving detail. A haphazardly repaired fence forms the focal point of the composition. His application of pink wash to the cottage walls gives the dilapidated farm courtyard an exceptional lyrical charm.Bloemaert most likely created this drawing as a study, possibly as part of a sketchbook. He painted primarily religious and mythological scenes, often with landscape backgrounds betraying his love of naturalistic subjects.On the verso, or back, of this drawing is a sketch of an old, twisted tree. Its leafless branches reach out to cover the entire sheet. The sinuous curve of the trunk bisects the composition. Similar trees appear in other paintings and drawings by Bloemaert.
Two cabbage plants, one quite tightly closed while the leaves of the other begin to unfurl, fill one side of a sheet. In the upper right, the tendrils of a squash or gourd plant reach out towards the center, with a fruit lying beneath the shade of its leaves. Abraham Bloemaert effectively contrasted such details as the broad leaves of the cabbage, with its coarse pattern of veins, with the delicate squash tendrils. Carefully applied areas of blue wash indicate shadows but also trail off into an atmospheric suggestion of continuity with the surrounding terrain.One of Bloemaert's contemporaries noted that  he has a clever way of drawing with a pen, and by adding small amounts of watercolor, he produced unusual effects.  The spiraling forms ofnaturalisticmotifscaptivated Bloemaert and other Dutch artists in the 1600s. He frequently enlivened theforegroundof his paintings and designs for prints with detailed illusionistically drawn plants. Being especially attracted to the pairing of cabbages and gourds, Bloemaert probably made this drawing as a study for such motifs in paintings or prints.
The soft, smooth skin of this female model seems to glow from within. From the soft, firm contours to the graceful wisps of hair that frame her head and neck so naturally, Abraham Bloemaert delicately modulated his red chalk line on creamy paper. Subtly and sensitively, he then touched in the white bodycolor that makes her luminous skin seem alive. Bloemaert probably made these studies for general practice; no paintings or prints directly relate to this sheet, though the lower profile image recalls an engraving after one of his designs.Bloemaert probably made the counterproof of the kneeling man on theversoby dampening an original drawing, then laying a clean damp sheet on top and running it through a press. Seeing the figure in reverse may have brought a fresh viewpoint to his work. The kneeling man bears a general resemblance to the shepherds in Bloemaert'sAdorationpictures. The hands sketched next to the man make gestures fitting for such a subject, but no known paintings directly resemble these studies.
By joining together the crisply delineated image of a solitary woman with the blurred image of a priest, it might be interpreted that photographer Donald Blumberg was attempting to make a metaphorical statement about faith. But Blumberg was more interested in using photography as a form of visual experimentation. His choice of religious subject matter was somewhat arbitrary. As he wandered the streets of New York City, he came upon the right type of light to test out his ideas: a dark background behind a brightly lit public walkway where he could anonymously record passersby. The sidewalk in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral proved to be the ideal place.Donald Blumberg's seriesIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedralwas made along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan between 1965 and 1967. By tilting the camera and excluding the edges of the building's darkened doorway as worshippers spilled out into the bright sunlight, he created unconventional scenes in which figures float against a dense black background, unmoored from the specificities of time and place. Blumberg planned and shot sequences that depicted a single figure successively, changed its scale, or blurred its appearance as he moved the camera during long exposures. By combining two to three contiguous 35mm frames within a single panoramic print, he introduced a sense of movement and narrative to still photography.
A man's face and the triangular shape of his white shirt beneath a dark jacket and tie float amorphously in a dark strip of space. On either side of him, at the corners of the elongated picture frame, blurry white figures drift into the composition. This juxtaposition could be read as a relationship between the human and spiritual worlds, or simply the realm of this man--or the photographer's--imagination.Donald Blumberg's seriesIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedralwas made along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan between 1965 and 1967.

A cloud of putti raise up to heaven an unknown saint with arms outstretched. Using rapid and somewhat sketchy penwork, Pedro Atanasio Bocanegra formed the saint and his chubby supporters with briskly drawn hatching. Quick lines suggest the extended fingers on the saint's right hand, while overlapping circles hint at the swirling motion of the putti. One putto even seems to ascend in a tornado like a small whirling dervish in the upper right. In the bottom corner, a plump cherub with tousled hair detaches himself from the group and flies off.Scholars believe that the saint is a deacon, since he wears a short tunic or dalmatic and a square ornament known as a pectoral on his chest.
This drawing depicts a crucial moment in a myth from Ovid'sMetamorphoseswhena nymph, Daphne, is transformed into a laurel tree to escape the advances of the love-struck god Apollo. Daphne is frozen mid-stride, her torso stiffening like the trunk of a tree. With shock and fear, she stares up at the green shoots erupting from her raised arm and the branches replacing her head of wavy hair.Jan Boeckhorst dramatized this brief moment with a dynamic composition and vibrant sketching technique. The figures stand robustly in the center of the composition, their colorful robes appearing to fly off of their shoulders as if caught by a gust of wind. Vigorous, diagonal strokes fill the sky and figures, adding a substantial sense of movement. Staccato dabs of green shoot from Daphne's tapered fingers as her flesh turns to flora. Even Apollo's crown of laurel leaves seems to sprout from his head, echoing Daphne's emerging foliage.Boeckhorst's drawing served as a compositional study for a tapestry illustrating the same subject. The tapestry is one of eight depicting the myths of Apollo.
As a young boy reaches out with his chubby hand to take a fistful of grapes, a maid reproaches him, placing her hand on his right shoulder. The scene takes place in an abundantly stocked pantry, where various kinds of dead fowl await preparation. The large table upon which the boy sits is laden with baskets, bowls, and platters that overflow with ripe fruit, including apples, peaches, and pomegranates. To complete this picture of domestic life, a cat stands in the window on the upper right, antagonizing two dogs below.Pantry scenes like this were derived from earlier paintings of town markets, which were appreciated for their display of nature's bounty. This painting is a collaborative work by Frans Snyders, who specialized in still lifes and animal subjects, and Jan Boeckhorst, who painted the figures.
Beginning in the 500s B.C., Greeks placedherms, pillars surmounted by a head of the godHermes, at physical boundaries, such as crossroads or even doorways. Such places were sites of ritual and worship, where the herms served a magical, protective function. By theHellenisticperiod, the repertoire of heads found on herms had expanded to include other gods and even famous mortals, and people began to use the herms for non-religious, decorative purposes.This herm carries a head ofDionysoswearing a turbanlike headdress of loosely wound ribbons. Both the hair and the beard of Dionysos have been carved in a style that would have looked old-fashioned to the contemporary viewer. Greek bronze statues typically had eyes made of contrasting materials. In most instances the eyes have been lost, but this herm still retains the ivory inlay of the white of its left eye, giving a better idea of the work's original appearance.
Crisply painted and teeming with detail, Boilly's picture transports us to Napoleonic Paris, where we stand on a shady boulevard outside the Jardin Turc (Turkish Garden Caf), a popular establishment that offered its middle-class clientele pleasures formerly reserved for the aristocracy. Young and old, fashionable and not, Parisians gather here for an afternoon's leisure. Two young street performers entertain the crowd: one shows an elegant couple his tame marmot, while the other puts on a puppet show for children hardly younger than himself.A resident of the Marais neighborhood, in which the scene takes place, Boilly included a self-portrait, in spectacles and a top hat, at the painting's rightmost edge.
Louis-Lopold Boilly's depiction of three artists in a studio conveys the serious and dignified role that he ascribed to the profession. Boilly's harmonious use of black-and-white chalk on beige paper further underscores the subject's sobriety. The three fashionably dressed men, with their tousled hair and intense expressions, confront the viewer with a sense of their fierce commitment to their metier and to each other. In Boilly's numerous variations on this theme, artists are shown in their studios, engaged in discussion with fellow-artists and surrounded by the fruits of their labors. It is likely that Boilly's three sons, all of whom became artists, were the models for this sheet.
The identities of the allegorical figures in this marble relief are suggested by the worlds they inhabit--a swirling mix of clouds, flames, waves, and earth. Together they represent the four elements paying tribute to Friendship. To the left, Friendship, who wears a wreath of myrtle, stands on a pedestal with her arm wrapped around an elm tree stump. Cybele, who personifies Earth, leans over two kneeling lions. Triton and Nereid emerge from the sea, representing Water. Zephyr, the Wind, reaches toward Jupiter--who, in the form of an eagle, holds a bolt of lighting that symbolizes Fire.In this sculpture, Louis-Simon Boizot varied the depth of carving to simulate space and physical presence. The foreground--the lions and Cybele, Nereid with her offering of sea treasures--pops forward. The sky with Zephyr and Jupiter, the drapery behind Friendship, and even the lions' rear ends, appear to recede into the background. Considering that the depth of this relief is less than three inches, the illusion of dimensionality is remarkable. The frame carved as part of the sculpture, and the fact that the figures don't protrude beyond it, however, evokes two-dimensional media such as painting.
The reading female represents an allegory of Study, while her male companion who writes on a tablet is Philosophy. These purely decorative objects copy the form of ancient oil lamps, but they were not actually functional.In 1780 the sculptor Louis-Simon Boizot sold models for these figures to the Svres porcelain manufactory, which produced them in unglazed white porcelain until 1786. The bronze chaser Pierre-Philippe Thomire mounted many pieces of the porcelain sold by the factory and therefore could have obtained Boizot's models for these bronze pieces through this close connection.
This personification of Charity appropriately distributes purses of alms to a destitute woman and her two naked children. Porcelain sculptures depicting such moralizing subjects were popular during the late 1700s, and the Svres porcelain manufactory sold many of them. Wealthy Europeans often used these small figural groups to adorn their dining tables.
Ferdinand Bol captured the dramatic moment in the Old Testament when Joshua  lifted up his eyes and saw a man standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand.  (Joshua 5:13) This figure, who identifies himself as a messenger of the Lord, brings God's instructions to Joshua, telling him to order his troops to march around the walled city of Jericho and destroy its inhabitants. Bol drew the messenger reaching out his hand, his piercing gaze fixed on Joshua off the sheet.Bol transformed the messenger from a prophet-like figure into one of supernatural dimensions. The man's heavenly aureole penetrates the surrounding shadows, rendered with tones of gray wash that intermingle with the white paper underneath. His flowing garments, drawn with loose, sketchy strokes, match his long hair and beard. The plain white texture of the paper forms the highlights on his robes, emphasizing the light that seems to isolate the figure from the darkness beyond.
Hans Bol painted this unusualminiaturein two parts: the central landscape, painted onparchmentmounted on wood, and the framing design, painted directly on wood. Both parts tell the story of the beautiful youth Adonis fromOvid'sMetamorphoses.In the main panel,Venusand Adonis embrace before he leaves on the hunt shown in the distance, in which he is killed by a boar. Clockwise from left, the frame's ovals show subsidiary incidents:Adonis'smother Myrrha commits incest with her father; turned into the myrrh tree as punishment, Myrrha bears their son, Adonis; Venus is struck with love for Adonis; blood springing from the dead Adonis turns into the anemone flower.In the frame, Bol combined the cartouches and trophies of a three-dimensional picture frame withillusionisticborders reminiscent ofmanuscriptillumination. His materials--opaque color and gold paint on parchment--also follow the tradition of manuscript illumination.
This illuminated initial depicts the death of Saint Dominic Guzman, who was the founder of the Dominican Order, one of the most influential monastic groups of the later Middle Ages. The scene was partly inspired by the accounts of a vision experienced by a Dominican friar named Fra Guala de Brecia (1180-1244). In the vision, Fra Guala saw Dominic ascending into heaven on a ladder held by Christ and the Virgin Mary. Beneath this scene, clergy and friars perform funeral rites over the saint's body. Nearby, the poor and infirm gather, hoping to benefit from the saint's relics. These figures did not feature in Fra Guala's vision, nor are they mentioned in textual accounts of Dominic's death. Instead, their presence reflects the medieval tradition of crowds gathering near a saint's relics in the hopes of being miraculously healed by his or her remains. Significantly, this leaf was made in Bologna where Saint Dominic's relics are kept.
Except for the portly man at the table's center, the figures are quintessential  Marble School  creatures, physically perfect, with soft, smooth skin as polished as the marble that surrounds them. Roberto Bompiani delighted in depicting varied textures and patterns, from the leopard-skin rug to the marble floor and table and a shimmering satin dress.Bompiani did extensive research to create the effect of authenticity, though he often mixed styles and periods in one canvas. He based thefrescoesand inlaid marble floor on Roman models, while the stone and bronze tables, lamps, and vessels depend variously on Greek, Roman, andEtruscansources.Bompiani's imaginarygenrescenes of Roman life, told with a combination of photographic realism, idealization, and archaeological accuracy, became popular in the late 1800s.
Somberly dressed in jacket and cravat, Franois Bonvin depicts himself with a serious and intense expression matched by the composition's dark tonality. Bonvin's grainy, dense application of black dramatically contrasts with the bare white paper which illuminates much of his face. This spotlight effect focuses our attention on Bonvin's self-assured gaze and his unsparing self-introspection in black chalk.When Bonvin drew this self-portrait he was about thirty years old. His artistic career was gaining momentum after his first successful exhibition in 1844. Like many Realist artists, Bonvin looked to Dutch artists of the 1600s, whose works could be viewed at the Louvre, for his models. Rembrandt was especially important to Bonvin and this drawing recalls Rembrandt's many dramatic, probing self-portraits. Around this time, Bonvin and Gustave Courbet had struck up a friendship and Bonvin was undoubtedly influenced by Courbet's commitment to realism in art, his black chalk drawings, and memorable self-portraits.
Franois Bonvin used delicate modulations of light and shadow to impart a meditative mood to this drawing of the interior of Aramont Abbey. The dynamic angles of the wooden pews and of the rear wall on the left of the drawing lead the viewer's eye to a light-filled side chapel. Along the right side of the drawing, repetitive vertical lines emphasize the interior's elevation. While the church's wooden pews fill the foreground, an organ accentuates the rear wall. The lack of any human presence seems to underscore that this space is meant for personal reflection.Bonvin used many materials to heighten the drawing's sense of perspective and mood. Pen, brown ink, and black chalk outline the church's details. Watercolor fills in the rear wall, the ceiling in the background, and the pews. White gouache highlights the columns and arches in the foreground. In many ways, this finely detailed drawing recalls the work of Pieter Saenredam, Bonvin's predecessor in painting church interiors.
Focusing on a bare tree, Lon Bonvin drew its web of branches in extreme detail. Beginning with the wiry bush at the left, moving on to the tree, then taking in a plowman and finally a distant town, he subtly leads the viewer through space. He suggested a setting sun through the golden glow backlighting the tree and the scene's pervasive stillness. Bonvin's careful structuring of this landscape, which alternates between wide panorama and minuscule detail, lends the image the complexity and completeness of an oil painting. The exquisite detail and vulnerable, melancholy mood characterize much of his work.As always, Bonvin made this watercolor as an independent work without a commission. By the 1860s, he made watercolors exclusively. His imaginitive mixing of pen and ink with watercolor combines precision with a delicate tonality that recalls early photography.
Jean-Antoine Nollet designed and assembled this pair of globes, which show maps of the earth's surface and skies. Globes frequently adorned the libraries of the aristocracy, lending an air of scholarly respectability in an age when uncharted territories around the world were being mapped and new trade routes established. They frequently appeared in eighteenth-century portraits but were usually supported on simple turned columns. These examples, with their red and yellowlacqueredstands decorated with Chinese figures, are exceptionally elaborate and may have been made to match similarly lacquered furniture.A pair of globes on tripod stands similar to those in the Getty Museum's collection is reproduced in an engraving from 1740 of the library of a wealthy eighteenth-centuryfinancier, Joseph Bonnier de La Mosson. The second floor of his townhouse was devoted to a series of seven rooms, including a chemistry room with fountains and ovens; an apothecary; alatheroom; a room for his drug supplies; a room that housed his collection of minerals and rare animals, stuffed or in jars; and a room filled with machines and models relating to clockmaking, navigation, and hydraulics.
Jean-Franois Nollet, a noted scientist who taught physics to the French royal children, designed and assembled this globe, which shows a map of the earth's surface. In 1728 he dedicated it to the duchesse du Maine, the wife ofLouis XIV'seldest illegitimate child. The duchesse was Nollet's most importantpatronand aunt to the comte de Clermont, to whom the celestial globe is dedicated.Louis Borde, the engraver of the map, also sponsored the costly printing process. He was the publisher who provided the money needed for the engraving of the copper plate, supervised the different stages of printing and the distribution of the prints, and remained in principle the owner of the plate.
A young man dressed in Roman armor looks over his shoulder with his legs stretched out, one arm resting on his shield, the other holding a sword. Beside himputtoplays with another suit of armor, a feathered helmet on his head, and a broad breastplate pushed upright in front of him.Paris Bordone used quick strokes of black chalk to suggest the shapes and figures in the drawing. Simple lines delineate the man's eyes, nose, and armor, while zigzagging lines create the feathers on the putto's wings.In this preparatory sketch, Bordone seems not to have decided whether the image should be rectangular, like the sheet of paper, or oval. The egg-shaped border appears to be somewhat of an afterthought, as it crowds the man's shield and feet.
On the interior of this Lakonian or Spartan black-figure kylix or cup, the Greek hero Bellerophon battles the monstrous Chimaera, a fire-breathing creature that combines elements of a lion, a snake, and a goat. In most depictions of this myth, a favorite among Greek artists in the 600s and early 500s B.C., Bellerophon rides Pegasos, his winged horse, but here he has dismounted, still holding the reins. While Pegasos strikes at the Chimaera with his hooves, Bellerophon spears the monster from underneath.The unique, symmetrical arrangement of the rearing horse and monster framing the hero is the result of the artist's attempt to find creative ways to fill the circular area of the interior of a cup. Three ornamental bands and palmettes at the handles decorate the cup's exterior.Lakonian vase-painters specialized in the decoration of cups; this example, with its high foot and slanting rim, fits the typical form. Both the interest in narrative and the use of the black-figure technique were new to Lakonian vase-painting when this vase was produced.
A pink carnation, a white rose, and a yellow tulip with red stripes lie in front of a basket of brilliantly colored flowers. Various types of flowers that would not bloom in the same season appear together here: roses, forget-me-nots, lilies-of-the-valley, a cyclamen, a violet, a hyacinth, and tulips. Rendering meticulous detail, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder conveyed the silky texture of the petals, the prickliness of the rose thorns, and the fragility of opening buds. Insects crawl, alight, or perch on the bouquet. Each is carefully described and observed, from the dragonfly's transparent wings to the butterfly's minutely painted antennae. Although a vague reference, insects, short-lived like flowers, are a reminder of the brevity of life and the transience of its beauty.A rising interest in botany and a passion for flowers led to an increase in painted floral still lifes at the end of the 1500s in both the Netherlands and Germany. Bosschaert was the first great Dutch specialist in fruit and flower painting and the head of a family of artists. He established a tradition that influenced an entire generation of fruit and flower painters in the Netherlands.
Scholars know little about this simple sketch, celebrating Giambattista Bodoni, an Italian printer who designed several modern typefaces in the late 1700s. It was probably taken from the pages of a notebook, as the top of themounthas been stamped with the numbers16and3.The drawing, which shows three different groups of figures gathered at a balcony, is apreparatory studyfor the artist'scartoonThe Apotheosis of Giambattista Bodoni.
Johann Friedrich Bttger, the first European to make hard-paste porcelain, developed red stoneware at the Meissen porcelain manufactory in 1708. One of the hardest ceramic materials ever produced, stoneware could be polished and engraved on a wheel. This vessel's form and smooth surface imitate the lidded cups of hardstone or carved ivory that Europeans admired and collected in the 1700s.
Furniture became increasingly specialized in the 1700s in France, as craftsmen produced objects for use on every occasion. Chairs came in a variety of shapes and sizes, such as thesechaises  la reine,which were low and comfortably padded--suitable to be drawn close to a fire. They were once part of a fifteen-piece suite of seating furniture acquired secondhand from the upholsterer Claude-Franois Capin forLouis XVIat the palace ofVersailles.
In this early landscape, Franois Boucher aimed to create picturesque, poetic effects rather than fidelity to nature. To anchor his lush foliage of energetic chalk strokes, he built a strong underpinning of a winding road and solid buildings and filled the scene with props and details. The drawing is probably his only landscape on vellum.Boucher may have made this drawing, along withReclining Guitar Player,for his first tapestry series for the Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory. He designed this series,Les ftes italiennes,between 1734 and 1746, and Beauvais produced and sold more copies of this tapestry series than any other. Before the Getty Museum purchased the drawing, the second Earl Spencer owned it.
As a young woman twists to look backward over her shoulder, she displays the voluptuous curves of her nude body. With her left arm hidden behind her torso, her right arm balances on the bolster pillow that supports her breast.In this simple sketch, Franois Boucher filled the model's body with a sense of motion and vitality even in repose, showing his mastery of line. From her twisting toes, bent forward to support her weight, to her tilted head and the muscular arms that prop up her body, Boucher captured the energy and poise required to hold this position. His strokes emphasize the sensuous lines of her body, while darker lines beneath her legs create a sense of depth and setting.
A young man lies outstretched with his legs crossed, reclining on a bunched piece of fabric and strumming a lute or another stringed instrument. With his back to the viewer and his face partially hidden, the man's twisted pose rather than his identity becomes the focus of the drawing. The gathers of fabric on which he leans, the wrinkled folds of his coat, and the outstretched length of his legs all create interest and draw the viewer's eyes around the figure and into the composition.Franois Boucher used a technique known asaux trois crayons, in red, black, and white chalks, which he and his contemporaries made popular in France in the 1700s. As a middle tone, he adopted the blue paper favored by Venetian artists.A favorite painter at the French court, Boucher designed tapestries for the royal factories, Beauvais and Gobelins. He made this drawing, one of very few that survive, for his first suite of tapestries, theFtes italiennes.
Beside a fountain on an outdoor stone terrace, Psyche is groomed by her attendants. Two maids stand behind Psyche and dress her hair. A large mirror reflects her face and one of her attendants. To the left of the mirror, an attendant appears transfixed by Psyche's beauty; another displays a length of pink silk fabric. At the right edge, a seated attendant sorts flowers and converses with a maid who carries powder and perfume on a silver tray. Psyche is probably being prepared for her first night with her new husband,Cupid.Nicolas Besnier, a silversmith and co-director of the Beauvais manufactory, probably advised Boucher on the trio of elaborate silver objects in the foreground--a large pitcher, basin, and tray.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
With arms outstretched, a despairing Psyche gazes upward at the departing figure ofCupid, who arches his back in flight against gray clouds. A trio of naiads, or waternymphs, witness the event, their eyes following Cupid's aerial departure. As Cupid leaves Psyche, she finds herself in a remote and stony wilderness, its lack of hospitality tempered only by the source of a spring whose cascading water becomes a stream.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
Love-struckCupidhas had beautiful Psyche brought to his opulent palace. Amid billowing clouds, Psyche enters the sun-drenched residence, although Cupid himself is not there. She is escorted byZephyr, the butterfly-winged god of the west wind. Psyche walks on aNear Easterncarpet that has been unrolled to receive her. Clusters of languid attendants play music, arrange flowers, or simply admire Psyche's dramatic entrance.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with this tapestry.
In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.
Surrounded by admirers, a recumbent Venus clasps a white dove to her body. At her feet, a pair of naiads, or water nymphs, presents red coral and other sea treasures to the goddess of love. Two tritons, semi-human sea dwellers, vigorously vie for Venus's attention. One triton blows on his shell-trumpet while the other, wedged between his partner and a fantastical dolphin, empties water out of his horn. In both sea and sky, putti pay tribute to the goddess. Amid all this attention, Venus remains impassive, decidedly detached from the churning sea.Franois Boucher's immense popularity in eighteenth-century Europe was matched by his versatility; he created everything from cabinet paintings to tapestry and stage designs. But this drawing is one of only three known gouaches by Boucher. In this work, the painter loosely applied the media--his handling varying from the expressive, almost chaotic, energy of the sea to the delicate, linear touch applied to Venus and her female attendants. Given its large size and ambitious composition, the gouache was probably created as an independent work of art and not as a study for a painting. Boucher frequently depicted this goddess, and the gouache bears a striking resemblance to hisVenus on the Waves, a later oil painting also in the Getty's collection.
A youth with a flute gazes languidly at his companionwhile another youth offers a shell full of fresh water to a dainty maiden in a diaphanous gown of purple-gold and red satin. A rosy-cheeked, barefoot woman dressed in red silk looks longingly at the man with the flute. Suitors woo and babies frolic in an idyllic setting of lush, green, leafy trees under a pale blue sky with gray-pink clouds.By blending sensuality, covert eroticism, and refinement, pastoral paintings such as these brought the world of aristocratic society and amorous games to the countryside. The pastoralgenrein which Franois Boucher excelled delighted his patrons, answering the contemporary nostalgia for nature and excluding coarse reality.The Fountain of Love,dated 1748, originally served as a finishedcartoonfor a tapestry, one of a series of six known as theNoble Pastorales. Beginning in 1755, the Beauvais tapestry manufactory wove the tapestries directly over the cartoons. Eventually, the cartoons were cut up into sections and sold separately. The tapestries remain, showing scholars how large the cartoons were and what is missing from them now.
Responding to the contemporary rage for pastorals depicting amorous countryside games, Franois Boucher here exhibited young, fashionable couples in the act of catching birds. In the 1700s, small birds played an important symbolic role in courtship ritual: the gift of a caged bird from a man to a woman signified her capture of his heart. Posed in front of the ruins of a temple to Vesta, young aristocratic women dressed in exquisite finery play with small birds; some still hold them on strings while others daintily hold them on their fingers.The Bird Catchersand itspendant,The Fountain of Love,were finishedcartoonsor models for a series of tapestries known as theNoble Pastorales.Eventually, the cartoons were cut up into sections and sold separately. The tapestries reveal how large the cartoons originally were and how much is missing from the cut-up sections.
This double-subject tapestry, woven to represent a painting with agiltwood frame decorated with shellmotifs, combines two subjects that were also woven individually. Each story comes fromclassicalmyths about the loves of the gods recorded inOvid'sMetamorphosesand other ancient sources. On the left,BacchusconsolesAriadneafter her abandonment byTheseus, whose ship sails away in the distance. On the right, Bacchus transforms himself into a bunch of grapes in order to seduce Erigone. Unwittingly, she accepts a basket of fruit containing the grapes from a servant. The Loves of the Gods  was the fourth of nine tapestry series designed by the painter Franois Boucher for the Beauvais manufactory. His drawings, known ascartoons, guided the weavers on the looms. Working simultaneously on such tapestries, a number of weavers would take a year to complete three square yards (two and a half square meters) a year. A tapestry of this size would take over three years to complete.
A bearded man, the godPan, assists a disheveled Psyche down an earthen path in a wooded vale. They approach two seated women--the goddessCeres, her right arm outstretched, and her daughterProserpine. The two goddesses are surrounded by sheaves of wheat and wicker baskets. In the lower left corner, a nanny goat, one of Pan's attributes, seems to look toward its master. At the top of the tapestry, set into the expansive sky, is agiltcartouche bearing the royalcoat of armsof France and the Kingdom of Navarre (a region of southwest Europe).Either Jean-Baptiste Oudry or Andr Charlemagne Charron also assisted with this tapestry.
 Voluptuousness was the essence and the soul of Boucher's art,  wrote the Goncourt brothers, famous art critics of the mid-1800s. Intended to be framed and hung like a painting,Venus andCupidtypifies Franois Boucher's works both in its unselfconsciously erotic female nude and in its sensual use of the chalk medium. Until the 1700s, few artists had actively cultivated the powdery, floating qualities of chalks. Here the greenpastelin the vegetation and the white chalk above it billow around Venus like a veil of smoke, complementing the soft, yielding fleshy bodies that Boucher created with a thick application of white chalk.Throughout his long career, Boucher made two to three drawings a day, producing approximately ten thousand known works ranging from quick sketches to finished compositions like this one.
A modeler at the SvresPorcelainManufactory based these figure groups on incidents depicted in a comic opera,La Valle de Montmorency(The Vale of Montmorency), a popular production in Paris in 1752. Franois Boucher designed the costumes and stage sets for this work. The success of the opera inspired porcelain makers to produce these figure groups,The Flute LessonandThe Grape Eaters,based on Boucher's paintings of scenes from the production.This was modeled under the direction of Etienne-Maurice Falconet.
In 1758 the Svresporcelainmanufactory introduced this shape, designed to be mounted onto a small table. The manufactory named the form, described in the Svres archives as aplateau de Courteille ou de chiffonire,after the marquis de Courteille, one ofLouis XV'sfinanciers, who represented the king's interest at Svres from 1751.The Svres artist Charles-Nicolas Dodin copied the scene from a painting by Franois Boucher onto the plaque. The original painting was set into wood paneling above a door in an important Parisian townhouse, the Htel de Soubise. It became one of Boucher's most popular scenes in the 1700s, known through many prints that circulated widely throughout Europe.
In a rustic barn interior, Franois Boucher created an idyllic scene of country life. In theforeground, a man repairs barrels while a mother and child rest in the straw by his side. As the sun streams in through the open doorway and down through the loft at the rear of the building, long fingers of light create patterns on the dark floor. The backlighting gives the scene an added sense of serenity, while throwing the figures at the front into deeper shadow.On a trip to Holland from around 1763 to 1766, Boucher studied Dutch landscape andgenre scenesfrom the 1600s. Influenced by Dutch depictions of idyllic countrysides and interiors, the French artist produced a number of drawings of rural settings. Although most of these drawings have now been lost, scholars examining the records of Boucher's contemporary collectors have found various titles of similar works, such asFarmer's House in the Form of a Barn and An Interior of a Barn with Three Farmers and a Woman.This drawing therefore provides the only known record of Boucher's visit to the Netherlands.
Franois Boucher depicted a mythological world of delicate sensuality and indolence.Puttiand doves attendVenus, the goddess of love, as she lounges amid a luxurious heap of drapery, while an elaborately decorative sky occupies the upper half the panel. The artist used apastelpaletteof blues, pinks, mauves, and peach tones and loose, rapid brushstrokes more characteristic of his tapestry designs than of his finished oil paintings.In 1768 Jean-Franois Bergert de Frouville commissioned a set of six mythological subjects for his house in Paris. Together with delicate furnishings of the period, these colorful paintings created a room ofRococorefinement and vivacity. Boucher painted the panels, including this one and its companion piece,Aurora and Cephalus, just one year before his death. The other four paintings now belong to another American museum.
In this tall decorative panel, Aurora, the goddess of dawn, gazes longingly upon the sleeping mortal Cephalus, with whom she has fallen madly in love. Here, Franois Boucher used light, pastel colors and the broad, rapid brushstrokes found in his tapestry designs. The sky is blue tinged with pink, and there is a suggestion of dawn awakening as light appears on the horizon. In contrast to Aurora's ethereality, Cephalus and his sleeping dog are bound to the earth; Boucher's choice of colors for these two--greens, reds, browns, and blues--accentuates this fact.In 1768 Jean-Franois Bergert de Frouville commissioned for his house in Paris a set of six mythological subjects Together with delicate furnishings of the period, these colorful paintings created a room of Rococo refinement and vivacity. Boucher painted the panels, including this one and its companion piece,Venus on the Waters, just one year before his death. The other four paintings now belong to the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.
This tapestry contains two scenes taken fromOvid'sMetamorphoses.At first glance, both scenes appear to show two female lovers in a wooded landscape. But the goddess of the hunt on the left actually represents the godJupiter, who has taken the form of Diana in order to seduce one of her followers. The eagle with thunderbolts in its claws, a symbol of Jupiter, is a clue to his presence.On the right, an old woman in heavy robes is reallyVertumnus, the god of orchards, disguised in order to enter the garden ofPomona, the young goddess of gardens. Identified by her attributes of fruit, flowers, and a watering can, she suspects nothing and dreamily listens to Vertumnus, who sits beside her.Imitating paintings, theseroundelsare set in oval frames, with the artist Franois Boucher's signature woven into the right scene. A decorative setting known as analentourssurrounds the two simulated paintings. As in the other tapestries in this set, thick garlands of flowers, exotic birds, and metalwork vases fill this border. Musical and hunting trophies hang beneath each roundel.The tapestry is based on designs by Maurice Jacques, Louis Tessier, and Jacques Neilson.
An ovalroundelimitating a framed painting fills the center of this tapestry. In a scene fromVirgil'sAeneid,the goddessVenusapproaches her husbandVulcan, trying to coax him to make weapons for her mortal sonAeneas. She has just descended from her chariot in the clouds on the left, accompanied by six white doves and acupid. Vulcan sits with his hammer and sword, while two cyclopes work in his forge on the right.The designers expanded the size of the wide border, known as thealentours,to fill the required space on a particularly long wall. The floral garlands, metal vases, and exotic birds are elements common to several of the other tapestries in this set, but two new trophies hanging from blue ribbons were added. To the left hangs an ornament symbolizing pastoral music by incorporating a horn, a book of music, and two tambourines. To the right, a straw basket, shepherd's horn, a drum, and floral headbands symbolize pastoral activities.This tapestry is also based on designs by Louis Tessier and Jacques Neilson.
Based on Book VII ofOvid'sMetamorphoses,theroundelin this tapestry shows Aurora, goddess of the dawn, gazing upon the sleeping form of her lover, the hunter Cephalus. She sits among clouds with the morning star shining on her forehead. Cephalus, a mortal who is bound to the earth, reclines on the forest floor, but his dog awakens as the goddess approaches.This roundel imitates a painting set in an oval frame, complete with Franois Boucher's signature under Cephalus. Exotic birds and a hunting trophy in the center ornament thealentoursor decorative setting, which was narrower than others in the set in order to fit the shorter wall of a room.This tapestry is also based on designs by Louis Tessier and Jacques Neilson.
In this tapestry, one of a set of four,Venusrises from turbulent waters in the centerroundel. Artists in the 1700s based this popular subject on various writings from ancient Greece and Rome. The roundel imitates a painting set in an oval frame, complete with Franois Boucher's signature on a rock. The scene is also inscribed with1766,the date the design orcartoonwas produced, rather than the year the tapestry was woven. Exotic birds, floral garlands, and a musical ornament in the center decorate thealentoursor border, which was narrower than others in the set in order to fit the shorter wall of a room.This tapestry also is based on designs by Louis Tessier.
Books of hours, made especially for the private devotional practice of lay people, were one of the most important types ofmanuscriptto be made in the later Middle Ages. Although this book is elaborately decorated with an innovative scheme ofilluminationand numerous marginal figures, it was illuminated not by major masters but by their followers. With the increased demand for books of hours in the early 1400s, collaborative ventures by different artists were common in the Parisian art market.  This book was certainly made for a woman; in fact, she is depicted kneeling in prayer in theminiaturesaccompanying two prayers to the Virgin.The manuscript epitomizes the sumptuous aesthetic of theInternational styleof painting. Characteristic features include the elongated proportions of the figures, their swaying postures, and their extravagant clothing. The borders are also classic examples of the International style in manuscripts, with richly colored acanthus leaves, brilliant touches ofgold leaf, and small playful figures appearing throughout.
This sumptuous page, whose border features a shimmeringbackgroundof gold, music-making angels, and colorful flowers, is the most richly decorated in the entiremanuscript.  The reason for such a lavish display of color and gold is that thisfoliomarks the beginning of the most important text in abook of hours, the Office of the Virgin.  Appropriately, the subject matter of theminiatureis the moment, as recounted in theBible, when Mary receives the news from thearchangel Gabrielthat she will bear the son of God.  The scene is set within a church.  Mary, kneeling before an altar on which a book and two candles stand, turns toward the angel to hear his words. A lily grows from a small pot to the left, a symbol of Mary's purity.
Concerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Women,written by Florentine poet and man of letters Giovanni Boccaccio, was one of the most popular literary works among the French aristocracy in the 1400s. Boccaccio's book was a collection of stories about exemplary heroes and heroines from biblical,classical, and medieval history. Laurent de Premierfait, who undertook this French translation(Des cas des nobles hommes et femmes),added additional tales from both ancient and more recent sources to Boccaccio's. All but one of theminiaturesin this volume were painted by the Boucicaut Master, one of the finest Parisianilluminatorsof the early fifteenth century, and his workshop of highly trained collaborators. In his framed miniatures, the Boucicaut Master used newly developed and highly saturated colors that were very expensive at the time. The high quality of theilluminationsand the scale of the decoration suggest that this book was made for someone in the court circle of King Charles VI of France.
Three anonymous artistsilluminatedthisbook of hoursfor a wealthy bourgeois woman, about whom scholars know little besides that she was probably named Margaret. The book typifies those coveted by middle-class women in Europe in the early 1400s. A medieval poet mocked this materialism, referring specifically to such books:  A book of hours, too, must be mine, just as a nobleman desires. Let it be splendidly crafted in gold and azure, luxurious and elegant. A book of hours contains prayers designed for laypeople and organized for private recitation at the eight canonical hours of the Church day. As the poet noted, the materials and decoration were as important as the textual contents. This luxuriously designed book contains seventeen three-quarter-pageminiaturesand twelve quarter-page miniatures, all on pages with delicate, leafy borders. The artists used expensivepigmentsand achieved an extremely high level of artistic refinement that undoubtedly dazzled the client.
One shepherd looks up in awe and another shields his eyes as two angels greet them with the phrase written on the scroll:Gloria in excelsis deo et in terr[a pax](Glory to God in the heights and on earth peace). The angels then announce that theChristchild has been born inNazareth, and one of them points to the town in the distance. Thisminiatureis the fourth in a series of eight scenes depicting the life of theVirgin Mary. The scenes accompany the eight sets of prayers of theHours of the Virgin. Laypeople recited the cycle of prayers over the course of a single day. During that time, the Virgin's story--beginning with theAnnunciationand ending with her coronation in heaven--unfolded in pictures before the devout reader.
Three sumptuously robed kings arrive from the East to present gifts to the newborn  King of the Jews.  The anonymousilluminatorof thisminiatureshowed the three kings in successive stages of approach to theChristchild. The oldest, closest to the child, has already removed his crown and kneels beforeJesusand Mary. The next is in the process of removing his crown and is starting to kneel. The last--the youngest--still stands and wears his crown. By showing the kings in this way, the illuminator created an image that fully presented the Adoration, from the arrival of the kings to the bestowing of the gifts. This treatment creates the impression of a formal ceremony of presentation entirely in keeping with the taste for courtly ceremony in the art of the 1400s.
An image of the original owner of the book kneeling in prayer before the enthroned Virgin and Child introduces a French-language prayer to the Virgin in thisbook of hours. To judge from her dress, the woman--the original owner of this book of hours--was a wealthy townswoman. Her name may have been Margaret, for marguerites (daisies) figure prominently in the border decoration throughout the book, including on this page.As the woman prays at her priedieu, theChristChild seems to wriggle off his mother's lap in an effort to reach her. This engaging portrayal of the infant makes the scene human and intimate, despite the formality of the angel's presentation of the woman and the Virgin's imposing throne.
Holy men and women robed in the rich, elegant colors of rose, burgundy, gold, orange, and blue illustrate a prayer toAll Saints. Their objects identify the saints in the front row.Saint Lawrence, in the vestments of adeacon, holds the grill on which he was tortured and killed. John the Baptist gestures toward a lamb, which alludes to his pronouncement aboutChrist:  Behold the Lamb of God.  Saint Peter's key symbolizes the authority Christ granted him, saying  I will give to you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Saint Catherine of Alexandriaholds a wheel and a sword, reminders of the tortures she suffered for her faith.By individualizing the saints' features and interspersing staffs, crosses, and martyr's palms among them, the anonymousilluminatorknown as the Boucicaut Master varied the rather formal construction of the miniature's repetitious lines of halos.
The Boucicaut Master's exquisite image of Mary Magdalene with her ointment jar introduces a prayer that focuses on her:Maria stabat ad monumentum plora[n]s(Mary stood at the tomb crying). The ointment jar recalls a story long associated with Mary Magdalene, that of the woman anointing Christ's feet at the house of Simon. Believed to have been a prostitute who gave up her former life to become a follower ofChrist, Mary Magdalene was an important model for repentant sinners. In this depiction, the Boucicaut Master endowed her with rich robes, a delicately modeled face, and a subdued, elegant pose, all characteristics that made him one of the most influential artists of his time.
Like many secular books of the period, this copy ofConcerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Womenopens with an image depicting the presentation of a book to apatron. The presenter kneels to the right, offering the blue-bound volume to the king on the left. The identity of the figures remains unclear. Therubricbelow the image reads:Cy commence le prologue du translateur du livre de iehan boccace des cas des nobles hommes et femmes(Here begins the translator's prologue to the book by Giovanni Boccaccio concerning the fates of illustrious men and women).
Giovanni Boccaccio began his book,Concerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Women, with the story of Adam and Eve. Theilluminatorencapsulated the main events of the biblical tale in hisminiature, placing the pivotal event of the Temptation--when Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge--in the center. He then organized a sequence of the subsequent events in their lives around the tall hexagonal walls of the Garden of Eden, beginning at the middle left and proceeding clockwise. Through a gate at the left, the first couple is expelled from the garden; beyond the garden walls, across the top of the page, Adam works his field while Eve spins. On the lower right, Adam and Eve, now elderly and stooped as part of the punishment for their sin, approach Boccaccio, seated at the lower left, to tell him their story. The elaborate border that encloses both the miniature and the opening lines of the text includes a sequence of paintedvignettesdepicting theCreationof the World, beginning on the upper right and proceeding clockwise. Though Boccaccio does not mention the Creation, the illuminator, known as the Boucicaut Master, included themedallionscenes to enrich the central image.
Clothed in a rich red gown trimmed with ermine fur, Creusa, daughter of the king ofCorinth, reaches out her right hand to touch the jewels that will kill her. Smiling graciously and unaware, she accepts wedding gifts dipped in a magical potion that would burn when touched, as indicated by the flames leaping from the open casket on the right. The gift-givers, sons of Jason and Medea, transmit Medea's intentions toward the new bride-to-be of her former husband.
The suicides of Meleager and his mother Althea conclude the bloody tale of the Calydonian boar hunt, which was one of the most famous episodes of Greek legend. Prince Meleager succeeded in killing the vicious boar that was let loose in the kingdom of Calydon, but he presented the honor of the hide to his love, the sole woman on the hunt, who had first wounded the boar. Outraged that a woman should receive the honor, Meleager's maternal uncles tried to take the hide for themselves, but Meleager killed them in a fit of rage. When Althea heard that her son had killed her brothers, she plotted to kill Meleager, but he had already repented of his act by taking his own life. Realizing she was bereft of her brothers and her son, Althea then killed herself in despair.
Grasping a rock in one hand and two trees in the other, the famousheroHerculeswrithes in pain. His twisted torso, raised leg, and despairing look heighten the sense of physical and mental agony induced by powerful poison and a trickycentaur.Years before this event, the centaur Nessus intercepted Hercules and his new brideDeianeiraand tried to rape her, but Hercules mortally wounded the centaur with a poisoned arrows. Before he died, Nessus told Deianeira to keep the blood from his wound, for anyone wearing a garment rubbed with it would love her forever. When Hercules subsequently fell in love with another woman, Deianeira saw the opportunity to use the magic blood to keep his love. She sent Hercules a garment smeared with Nessus's blood, but the supposed love-charm proved to be a powerful poison.
Boccaccio'sConcerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Womenincludes such Biblical characters as Samson, the legendary warrior and one of the judges of ancient Israel, whose unbridled passions led to his downfall. In thisminiature, theilluminatordemonstrated Samson's unequaled strength. The bodies of man and beast are united in a pyramid, with Samson's victory ensured more by physical dominance than action. The artist conveyed the weight of Samson's body, the animal's tensile strength, the twist of its neck, and the manner in which Samson holds its mouth open, but without much sense of physical force. The pair seem as much engaged in a ballet as a struggle. In a technique characteristic of this workshop, two figures hidden in the trees at the right witness the scene. They provide a model for the reader of themanuscript, who, by looking at the image, also witnesses the event.
A blue cloud and a ring of red-winged angels surround the figure of God, echoing the colors found in the brilliant diaperedbackground. The image may represent the episode from Saul's life when a group of prophets witnessed the spirit of God descend upon him. Though the figures in the image were probably meant to representOld TestamentJews, scholars cannot determine their exact identity. The text that follows this image, prefacing the second section of Boccaccio'sConcerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Women,discusses the history of Saul, who became the first king of the Jews.
Two men seize a woman by the hair, pulling her forward while a third man watches from behind. The woman is Athaliah, the daughter of King Ahab of Israel and his wife Jezebel. Her family married her to the heir of the throne of Judah in order to link the two Hebrew kingdoms more closely. When Athaliah's husband as well as her oldest son died, she ordered that all other royal offspring should be killed and seized the throne of Judah for herself. Unknown to her, her grandson was saved and raised in the Temple. When he reached seven years of age, he was secretly crowned king. Athaliah rushed to the Temple crying treason, but the royal guards seized her and killed her. In the image, two guards ruthlessly drag Athaliah from the Temple while the new king, shown here as a grown man, watches from above. Athaliah was the only woman ever to rule either of the two Hebrew kingdoms.
Didoappears shown atop the blazing funeralpyreshe constructed for herself, plunging a dagger into her breast before a group of horrified onlookers. Daughter of the king of Tyre, Dido was grief stricken after her husband was murdered by her brother. She fled from her homeland to the coast of Africa, where she purchased a piece of land from a local chieftain, Iarbas, and founded the city ofCarthage. As the city prospered, Iarbas persistently sought her hand in marriage. In her desperation to evade his suit, she chose to commit suicide.
According to legend, Astyages, the king of the Medes, had a dream one night that one of his descendents would grow up to overthrow him. He immediately ordered that his precocious grandson Cyrus be killed. His chief adviser, however, secretly gave the baby to a shepherd to raise. Here the shepherd minds his sheep, while the child Cyrus takes nourishment from a wild goat in order to survive. Astyages discovered Cyrus when he reached the age of ten, but others persuaded Astyages to allow the boy to live, in spite of the dream. Cyrus eventually did revolt against his grandfather and conquered the kingdom in 550 B.C.
Dressed as a warrior, Thamaris, a woman who ruled over a group of nomads who lived to the east of the Caspian Sea, stands over the barrel that catches the blood of her enemy, Cyrus, king of the Medes. An executioner holds Cyrus's head by his hair, while behind him lie the dead bodies of the defeated army. As part of his effort to consolidate his regime's possessions, Cyrus had attempted to subdue the territory of Thamaris. Although he encountered a struggle, he had attacked successfully and captured the queen's son. After her son committed suicide in Cyrus's captivity, Thamaris swore revenge and finally succeeded in both killing Cyrus and defeating his army.
On the left, thepersonificationofFortune, an elegantly dressed woman with wings, wrestles with the personification of Poverty, a woman raggedly dressed and barefoot. According to the text, Poverty wins this struggle and her victory has a moral message: the renunciation of worldly goods is a virtue that renders fate powerless. Those who voluntarily forsake fame, wealth, and power cannot be affected by a reversal of fortune.After her triumph over Fortune, Poverty orders that Misfortune, shown partly clothed in thebackground, be bound to a column. Boccaccio himself appears on the right, dressed as a scholar in a red gown with a hood, echoing the text's mention that he had first heard this story from a professor of astronomy when he was a young student in Naples.
While bystanders--a typical feature of the Boucicaut Master's compositions--witness the event from the walls of the palace, a hired henchman murders Servius Tullius,Etruscanking of Rome, at the order of his son-in-law Lucius Tarquin. According to Boccaccio, Servius's daughter Tullia married Lucius, son of the previous king, but she scorned her husband Lucius because he had not succeeded his father as king. Lucius therefore seized control of the government and had King Servius executed on the road to the palace, as seen in thisminiature. In her haste to reach the palace and take her place as queen, the heartless Tullia drove over her own father's body in the street.
The Roman noblewoman Lucretia plunges a knife into her breast as her husband, her father, and a man named Junius Brutus look on in horror. The tragedy of Lucretia began when Sextus, the son of the tyrannicalEtruscanking of Rome and a member of the Tarquin family, raped her. For the ancient Romans, a woman who was raped was guilty of adultery, a crime punishable by death, even though she had not given herself willingly. After she was raped, Lucretia made her husband and father swear an oath of vengeance against the Tarquins and then killed herself in shame. Enraged by her death, Junius Brutus led a victorious rebellion against the Etruscan king and freed the Romans from Etruscan rule, marking the beginning of theRoman Republic.
Though the bridge shown here resembles one that the artist might have seen spanning the Seine in Paris during the 1400s, the Boucicaut Master meant to represent the immense bridge that Xerxes I, the great Persian king, constructed to facilitate his invasion of Greece in 480 B.C. Of positively gigantic size, the bridge linkedAsia Minorwith Europe, and the entire Persian army--a million men--crossed it on foot. The author Boccaccio reported that soldiers sliced mountains and filled valleys in constructing their path, but he did not state exactly how the bridge was made. Historians today believe Xerxes' incredible bridge was actually made of ships linked together.
Her head placed upon a block, the young Roman woman Virginia awaits a fatal blow from her father in front of Roman judges. Beautiful and virtuous, Virginia had been promised in marriage to a Roman tribune named Lucius. At the behest of his commander, Appius Claudius, who secretly desired her, however, a sergeant named Marcus claimed Virginia for his own. Lucius and Marcus stated their claims to the woman before a group of judges that included Appius. When Appius judged unfairly in favor of his sergeant, Virginia's father publicly executed her to protest the judge's misuse of power in claiming Virginia for himself and forcing her to break her vow to Lucas.
Cartalus, whose body hangs from the gibbet, unsuccessfully attempted to avoid a conflict between religious duty and familial obligation. His father, a nobleman ofCarthage, had been banished to Syria because of his political ambition to control the city. He ordered Cartalus, an influential high priest, to persuade the populace to allow his return. At a public celebration devoted to the heroHercules, Cartalus respected his priestly duties instead of his father's wishes; he conducted the religious sacrifice following custom, neglecting to plead his father's case. After the ceremony, Cartalus returned to his father, who had him hanged for disobedience. The artist painted the story's poignant ending, an event not mentioned in the text.
In theforeground, henchmen of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, execute the king's sons, along with their wives and children, for plotting against him. In thebackgroundstands Artalia, one of the king's concubines, wearing a red dress. Artaxerxes' favorite son Darius fell in love with her, but the king objected to his son's attachment and gave Artalia to the temple ofApollo, where she became a priestess and took a vow of chastity. In revenge, Darius plotted against the king with fifty of his brothers. Like many stories found in Boccaccio's book of moral tales, this one presents a woman as the cause of men's misfortune.
Wielding his sword, the consul Marcus Manlius fiercely defends Rome against an attack by the Franks in 390 B.C. With the remains of his army, Manlius fortified the Capitoline Hill against the advancing enemy, who ardently tried to capture the hill using ladders. Manlius and his men held out, though, and the Capitoline Hill remained the only unoccupied portion of Rome. For his bravery in this heroic feat, Manlius received the surname Capitolinus.
Polycrates, the tyrannous ruler of the Aegean island of Samos, stands beside the river into which he tossed a golden ring covered with precious stones, hoping to divert future bad luck. Boccaccio's story tells that he found the ring again in a fish's belly, but the artist or his adviser misinterpreted the story. Confusing the French word for ring,annel,with that for lamb,agnel,the Boucicaut Master painted the fish returning a lamb to Polycrates instead of his ring.Despite his luck with the ring, a dire fate awaited Polycrates. Seeking to capture the riches of Samos, the Persian governor of Sardis imprisoned Polycrates and had him executed. The artist contrasted Polycrates' hanging with the fortuitous return of the ring. These two scenes succinctly demonstrate the theme of the entire book: the vacillating nature offortune.
The men held in the stocks may be Persian prisoners of war, taken after a series of battles betweenAlexander the Greatand Darius III, king of Persia, in which the Persians sustained great losses. According to Boccaccio, very few of the 500,000 Persian foot soldiers and horsemen who participated in the final engagement survived.On the other hand, theminiaturemight depict Darius himself, who fled the battlefield and was briefly imprisoned afterbetrayalby his own comrades.
With tear-filled eyes, the bedridden Agathocles, king of Sicily, orders his wife to leave him and return to Egypt with their two children. Despite his earlier struggles to reach the throne, a true rags-to-riches story, he nobly cried not for the loss of his kingdom but for his family. Though born the son of a potter, Agathocles had used his charm, political savvy, and ruthlessness to become tyrant of Syracuse and self-styled king of Sicily. When he suffered a painful and debilitating illness during a struggle againstCarthage, he was concerned that his family would be murdered, imprisoned, or enslaved in a struggle of succession for the throne after his death.
Two men drag theMacedonianqueen Arsinoe by her hair from aGothiccity gate, before which lie the dead bodies of her sons. A politically powerful woman, Arsinoe's strength derived from familial ties, but family also caused her suffering. The daughter ofPtolemy, Arsinoe became queen of Macedonia by marrying Lysimachus, the Macedonian king.After Lysimachus's death, Arsinoe agreed to marry her own brother Ceramus, a military commander who wanted to rule as king. Before the ceremony, however, she had her two sons crowned instead. Pretending to accept the situation, Ceramus peacefully entered the city, then captured the castle, ordered his nephews slaughtered, and exiled his sister. Later, Arsinoe's fate turned yet again when she married her other brother, Philadelphus, and became queen of Egypt.
Pyrrhus, king of the ancient Greek territory of Epirus, collapses with a shoulder wound after a fierce battle against the Romans. In 281 B.C. he sailed to the aid ofTarentum, a Greek colony in southern Italy at war with Rome. As the text explains, the battlefield was located near a castle, which the artist depicted as a massive fortress. After Pyrrhus fled the skirmish due to his injury, his troops suffered from confusion and sustained great losses. Pyrrhus finally defeated the enemy but only at great cost to his army, leading to the expression  Pyrrhic victory  for a victory offset by staggering losses.
After a long and bloody civil war with his brother Seleucus, the defeated Antiochus III, king of Asia and Syria, sought asylum in Cappadocia with his brother-in-law. Turned away, he fled to Egypt, where the king imprisoned him. Antiochus managed to escape with the help of a courtesan, but while in flight he was attacked in a forest by marauders who slit his throat. In the miniature, one brigand stabs the king in the throat, while the second rogue prepares to thrust his dagger into the king's exposed chest.
Two cruelCarthaginiantorturers crush the Roman consul Marcus Atilius Regulus between spiked boards set up on trestles. The brutal scene takes place inside a low, gray-walled enclosure. To the right, three elderly, bearded men peer over the wall, gravely contemplating the spectacle before them. The Boucicaut Master furthered the drama of the episode by contrasting Regulus's pale clothing and pathetic facial expression with the hefty physicality of the torturers.The Roman consul Regulus served in the Punic war, defeating the Carthaginians in 256 B.C. His demands for an unconditional surrender, however, so angered the Carthaginians that they continued their battle and in 255 soundly defeated the Romans. As a Carthaginian prisoner, Regulus was sent back to Rome to negotiate a peace treaty. Against the protests of his fellow citizens, he returned to Carthage to fulfill the terms of his captivity; according to legend, he was then tortured to death. The Romans saw Regulus as a hero, and his legend was kept alive through inclusion in medieval texts like Giovanni Boccaccio'sConcerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Women.
In one of a number of cities destroyed by the Romans in their conquest of Greece and Africa, Roman soldiers take prisoners from a city in flames. The text that follows the image outlines a series of Roman victories, including those atCorinth,Argos, andCarthage. At Carthage, for example, which the general Scipio destroyed in 146 B.C., the Romans took 26,000 women and 30,000 men as prisoners, according to Boccaccio. They also gathered large numbers of captives from the many other cities they subjugated.
This image may represent the citizens of Syracuse killing their king, Hieronymus. The female figure who holds the king on her lap may be Demaratha, the king's daughter. She was later sliced to pieces in the temple before the altar of the gods, without regard for her noble status.
This image seemingly offers a conflicting visual message. The crown upon the man's head denotes his royal status, yet the walking stick and rucksack suggest a destitute state. Both are true since Prusias, once the rich and powerful ruler of Bithynia, was deposed by his son and reduced to begging. This punishment from God repaid Prusias for his violation of the laws of hospitality during the Second Punic War. TheCarthaginiangeneral Hannibal had asked Prusias for protection against the Roman army, but Prusias betrayed him.
Despite the crown and rich costume worn by the prisoner in this image, the man is not of royal lineage. A serf named Andriscus, he succeeded in passing himself off as Philip, the deceased king ofMacedonia, resurrected from the dead. While occupying the throne, he assembled an army and waged war against the Romans. Only after multiple campaigns did the Roman consul Metellus defeat and capture him. The false king was then taken to Rome and ridiculed in a triumphal procession, the probable subject of thisminiature. The text explains that Andriscus was raised from a base state to that of royalty by a turn of fortune but ended by falling to a state even lower than his humble origins.
The blood-red sky and green ocean form a menacingbackgroundagainst which the devious action of thisminiatureunfolds: a guard drives his battle-ax into Demetrius Nicator's back as he attempts to land in Tyre. Demetrius, king of Syria, was unpopular among his troops and subjects. His pride was his downfall, and he was deposed and imprisoned several times. Defeated and deserted by his wife and children, the king left Syria, taking a boat to Tyre. He planned to devote himself to the service of the godHercules, who had a temple there. He arrived safely at the port, but the prefect of Tyre had him killed as he left his ship.
Though the miniature's courtly elegance partly masks the horror of thenarrative,PtolemyEuergetes, king of Egypt, committed a horrendous act of vengeance against his queen,Cleopatra. After the death of his brother, Ptolemy married Cleopatra, his brother's widow. To avoid sharing power with her son, he had the child, who was both his nephew and stepson, murdered.The severed head and limbs in the image, however, belong not to this infant but to a second unfortunate child, also a victim of Ptolemy's wrath. Hearing of the king's crime against his wife's son, the people deposed him and selected Cleopatra as their ruler. In retaliation, Ptolemy had his own son, also born of Cleopatra, murdered and sent the child's severed head and limbs to her during a banquet.
Although the author Boccaccio seemed unsure of the ultimate fate of Jugurtha, son of a Numidian prince and a concubine, he stated that some historians believed he was killed at night and tossed from the Tarpeian Rock into the Tiber River tied to a stone. In thisminiature, however, Jugurtha is thrown from a tower, rather than from a rock. Jugurtha was excluded from the line of succession by his grandfather's will, but his father raised him in the palace with his half-brothers the princes. Having proved his valor in military exploits, he was accepted as a legitimate heir to the throne and inherited a third of the kingdom. Greedy for the entire kingdom, he murdered his brothers to inherit their portions. His covetous nature, however, eventually led to his downfall. His own father-in-law recognized his ruthless nature and handed him over to the Romans, who took him as a captive and had him killed.
On the right, theallegoricalfigure ofFortuneappears before Boccaccio, the author of the book. The artist partially followed Boccaccio's text, which describes Fortune as having wings and multiple arms. The wings attest to Fortune's flightiness and swiftness, while her many arms indicate that no one can escape her grasp. The text goes on to say, however, that she is a hideous monster, whereas the artist chose to depict her as a beautiful courtly lady. Functioning as anauthor portrait, the image shows Boccaccio in profile and dressed as a scholar. He sits at a circular writing desk, which turns to allow easy access to his reference books. The confrontation of the author with Fortune corresponds to a recurrent theme in Boccaccio'snarratives: the power of Fortune over humankind.
Caius Marius, whose forces had recently been defeated during the Roman civil war, despairs when he sees his brother's decapitated head. Caius Marius had been exiled after the civil war, and the vindictive general who had defeated him ordered that his brother Marcus be punished. Marcus was dragged and blinded and had his hands cut off, his legs broken, and finally, his head cut off. Upon receiving his brother's severed head, Caius Marius lost all hope that he and his faction would ever regain control of Rome. He begged a reluctant servant to kill him, as seen on the right.
The figure wielding the sword and wearing a king's crown over a red hat may be Mithradates, the king ofPontusand Asia, participating in a tournament during the years he spent traveling around Asia as a young man. Disguising his identity, he lived among the locals, captured animals for food, and developed his courage and physical strength.Theminiature, however, may allude to King Mithradates' death. Following a series of disastrous wars with the Romans, his own army revolted against him. After poisoning his wives, concubines, and daughters to prevent them falling into the hands of his enemies, he poisoned himself. But since he had previously taken a remedy against the drug, it proved ineffective. In a desperate attempt to end his life, he begged a French soldier, probably a mercenary, to kill him. This image, then, may depict Mithradates' assisted suicide.
The headless body of the Roman statesman and general Pompey floats at sea, while an Egyptian soldier holds his severed head aloft on a lance. After opposing Julius Caesar during a civil war, Pompey fled to Egypt seeking Ptolemy's aid against Caesar.Ptolemysent a small ship to meet Pompey, as if he wanted to greet him with respect, though he had deceitfully instructed his servants to kill him. They beheaded Pompey at sea and carried his head on a lance throughout Alexandria, as if celebrating a great victory. Later, they presented their ghoulish trophy to Caesar.
Chased by Egyptians and forced to flee from his sinking boat, Julius Caesar swims to another ship holding a letter raised above the water in his hand. Although Boccaccio did not reveal the contents of this letter, he described in detail the events leading to Caesar's desperate plight. While chasing an enemy during the Roman civil war, Caesar had entered Alexandria, Egypt. After the Romans set fire to the Egyptian king's boat, which was stranded ashore, the flames spread to the famous royal library and destroyed 40,000 books. Caesar withdrew to the island of Pharos but then had to retreat from the enraged Egyptians. During his hasty flight from the island, Caesar was forced to abandon his sinking ship and swim to safety. Caesar later defeated the Egyptian army, captured the Egyptian king, and then granted control of Egypt to the king's sisterCleopatra.
Two men stand before the tomb of MarcAntonyandCleopatra, whose suicides ended a Roman civil war. After the death of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., control of the Roman state was divided between his heirsOctavianand Marc Antony, sparking a Roman civil war. Antony allied himself with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra against Octavian. After their horrendous defeat at Actium in 31 B.C., Cleopatra and Antony fled to Egypt, where they both committed suicide, he with a sword, she with poisonous snakes. According to Boccaccio, Octavian had their tombs placed side by side.The Boucicaut Master recreated their tombs as a single structure in the EuropeanGothicstyle, rather than as Egyptian monuments. The effigies display the implements of their deaths, the sword and the snake.
Herod, the king of Judaea, watches as his soldiers slaughter the innocent children of Bethlehem in an attempt to kill the infantJesus, whom Herod feared would eventually seize his kingdom. According to Boccaccio, 144,000 children were murdered.The story of Herod was particularly appropriate for Boccaccio's book, which recounted the tricks that fate can play. Made guardian and defender of Galilee at the age of fifteen, Herod exhibited wisdom beyond his years. He rose through the political ranks to become king, building cities and impressive edifices. Suspicious and greedy, he executed his wife and children for plotting against him. In his old age, he suffered from a gruesome skin disease and a guilty conscience, eventually leading him to attempt suicide unsuccessfully with a sword.
Messalina, the young wife of the aged emperor Claudius, stands between the Roman emperorsCaligulaand Tiberius in the flames of hell, where they discuss their sins. When Messalina joined the group, the men asked why she was there. Had she come to see her stepson Drusus, whom she poisoned, or was she there to consult with other women who shared her lustful nature Messalina admitted her sin of lust but blamed her libidinous nature on the astrological configuration present at her birth. She then reminded the emperors of their sins. Caligula had committed incest with his three sisters, exiled them, and had them killed. He had raped married women, poisoned people, and declared himself a god. Tiberius had killed his brothers, committed false accusations, and perpetrated sins against nature. Messalina won the debate by demonstrating that their sins were far worse than hers and reminding them to repent first, before reproaching others.
Seated before the lifeless body of his mother Agrippina, the Roman EmperorNeroreceives achaliceof wine from a kneeling servant. Nero had become emperor through the actions of Agrippina, who poisoned the emperor Claudius after convincing him to adopt Nero as his heir. Knowing she had made him emperor, Nero feared her power. Following an incestuous affair with her, he stripped her of her authority. After trying unsuccessfully to kill her several times, he finally sent a boat designed to sink to transport her to a party. The boat did sink, but she swam to shore.In desperation, Nero ordered a soldier to kill her. Without tears or any signs of sorrow, he examined, held, and caressed her dead and discolored corpse. He praised and cursed the various parts of her body. Then, while others cried, he asked for some wine. Drinking it, he looked at his mother and declared that she was beautiful.
On the banks of the Tiber, three assailants stab the Roman emperor Vitellius, a major protagonist in the struggle for succession afterNero'sdeath. He had been declared emperor by his troops but was defeated by Vespasian, whose own army had declared him emperor. Humiliated and ridiculed for his cowardliness and gluttony, Vitellius lost his kingdom to Vespasian, who exemplified the virtues of the ancient Romans: chastity, sobriety, courage, and wisdom. Vitellius was eventually stabbed almost to the point of death, dragged in great pain  like a stinking dog,  and tossed into the river Tiber.
The Boucicaut Master often included witnesses to the events he depicted: here two men observe a horrendous, cannibalistic act through a window. A Jewish woman named Mary eats the hand of her child, whom she had killed and roasted. When the Romans beseiged Jerusalem in A.D. 70, leading to a terrible famine, hunger had supposedly led to acts of desperation. Theminiaturefollows a discussion of the siege and prefaces a text that speaks against Jews, whose tribulations were believed to be the result of their failure to acceptJesusas theMessiah. Boccaccio states that, just as the Jews captured Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, so the Romans captured the Jews' holy city.
InConcerning the Fates of Illustrious Men and Women, Giovanni Boccaccio identifiesPetrarch, the contemporary Italian poet, as his mentor. Here, in the smallminiatureby the Boucicaut Master and workshop, Petrarch appears to Boccaccio in a vision, wearing the crown of laurel associated with poetic achievement. In this dream, Petrarch rouses Boccaccio from an exhausted slumber and inspires him to resume work on his book. Boccaccio's modest expression and the downcast eyes that reveal his embarrassment make the scene's emotion apparent.Swirling vines of golden ivy and various figures, such as a fantastic animal and an exotically dressed man playing an organ, cover the border. In contrast to the saturated, vivid colors of theillusionisticminiature, the decorative ornament is painted with delicate, transparent brushwork.
Shapur I, king of Persia, mounts his horse by treading on the back of the Roman emperor Valerian. After a series of wars against the Romans, Shapur defeated Valerian at Edessa in A.D. 260 and kept him captive for the rest of his life. Boccaccio speaks directly to Valerian in the text, telling him that he dishonored the people of Rome and should have killed himself to avoid such humiliation. He says that Valerian deserved his fate because he had oppressed Christians, cursed the name of God, and persecuted the Church, while allowing pagans to worship false gods. The wordAncram,which appears below theminiature, can be found on a number offoliosin thismanuscript. It is the signature of the Earl of Ancram, who owned the manuscript in the 1700s.
Two servants of the Roman emperor Galerius cover their mouths from the stench of his rotting flesh. The emperor lies on his deathbed, suffering from a horrendous malady that reportedly caused his entrails to decay inside his body and worms to come out of his mouth, ears, and nose. For people in the Middle Ages, illness was often seen as the result of sin, and Galerius's sickness was interpreted as his punishment for persecuting Christians. According to Boccaccio, Galerius was not punished byJupiter, whom he falsely honored and disloyally served in Rome, but rather byJesus, the celestial king born of a virgin, who is Lord of heaven and earth
Though difficult to interpret precisely, this image of men feasting in a military encampment in Italy relates to the story of Radagaisus, leader of the Ostrogoths, who, after pledging to sacrifice all Italians to the gods, invaded Italy. Reaching Tuscany and confronted by the Roman army, Radagaisus was forced into the mountains, where he suffered from cold and lack of food and water. He and his entire army either succumbed to the dire conditions or were killed by the Romans. Boccaccio contrasted Radagaisus's failure with the victory of the Visigoth king Alaric, who successfully sacked Rome four years later. Alaric had vowed to spare the lives of Christians and was thus victorious.
With his sword in hand, Clotaire III, king of France, passively watches the punishment of his mother Brunhilde for her crimes of adultery and murder. Falsely accused by her enemies, she was tried, publicly humiliated, and sentenced to this horrible death without any intervention from her son.The Boucicaut Master depicted a horseman dragging Brunhilde, whose hair was tied to his horse's tail. The queen was later drawn and quartered, with horses tied to her hair, one foot, and one hand pulling her apart. In a twist of fate, the executioners, who had once honored Brunhilde as queen, washed their hands on her robes.
At the left, a man cuts off the nose and lips of theByzantineemperor Justinian II, whose ruthlessness led to the revolt of his people in 695. Justinian regained control of his kingdom but was later deposed, resulting in Philippicus's succession as emperor. According to Boccaccio, Philippicus waged war against sacred images and their veneration. His army deposed and blinded him, as seen on the right. Having tried to prevent others from viewing sacred images of God and the saints, he fittingly lost his own sight.
The French king Philip the Fair and hiscourtierswatch as executioners burn members of the Knights Templar at the stake. When Philip and other enemies accused them of various crimes including heresy and sodomy, governments--first in France and then all over the world--seized their lands. In 1312 the Pope totally suppressed the chivalric order, which had been founded during theCrusadesas a military religious order devoted to the protection of pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. After a series of confessions and retractions, the grand master of the order, whose story accompanies thisminiature, was burned in 1314 as a heretic. A hundred years after the event, theilluminatorportrayed the knights sympathetically, with their eyes turned toward heaven; one executioner even covers his eyes, unable to bear the sight of their suffering.
A young nude woman sits with her arms outstretched, pushing away a winged boy. He isCupid, the god of love, holding up an arrow to pierce her. The title suggests that the young woman is trying to defend herself, yet she smiles and struggles unconvincingly against the mischievous little god.Visitors to the Paris exhibitions of the 1870s and 1880s loved Adolphe Bougereau's paintings. The Getty Museum's painting repeats a larger composition that Bougereau made for the ParisSalonin 1880; a viewer probably saw the larger version there and requested a smaller one for private viewing.Bougereau placed his mythological fantasy in an idyllic, Arcadia-like landscape. In fact, he made this composition in his studio, copying the landscape from the neighboring French countryside and using one of his favorite models.
The uprightsecrtairebegan to be a fashionable form around the mid-1700s, when letterwriting became a popular pastime. Themarchands-mercierswere quick to respond to this demand, providing many types of small tables or desks with interiors fitted for storing writing tools. The front lowers to form a writing surface, revealing drawers and pigeonholes.Until his death in 1785, Martin Carlin was thebnistemost frequently employed by themarchands-merciersto mount porcelain plaques on furniture; this piece is likely to have been made for one of them. This expensive form of decoration began around 1760 and became extremely fashionable within ten years. In addition to the porcelain plaques, the gilt bronze mounts in the form of drapery swags and the hanging oak branches are also typical of Carlin's work.
The decoration on this monumental cabinet refers to the French king Louis XIV's military victories. A panel of marquetry showing the cockerel of France standing triumphant over both the eagle of the Holy Roman Empire and the lion of Spain and the Spanish Netherlands decorates the central door. On the drawer above the door, gilt-bronze military trophies flank a medallion portrait of Louis XIV. In the Dutch Wars of 1672 - 1678, France fought simultaneously against the Dutch, Spanish, and Imperial armies, defeating them all. This cabinet celebrates the Treaty of Nijmegen, which concluded the war. Two large figures from Greek mythology, Hercules and Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, representatives of strength and bravery in war, appear to support the cabinet.The fleurs-de-lis on the top two drawers indicate that the cabinet was made for Louis XIV. As it does not appear in inventories of his possessions, it may have served as a royal gift. The Sun King's portrait appears twice on this work. The bronze medallion above the central door was cast from a medal struck in 1661 which shows the king at the age of twenty-one. Another medallion inside shows him a few years later.The pair to this cabinet still exists in Scotland. Both cabinets probably entered England in the early nineteenth century after the French Revolution caused the dispersal of so many French collections.
This box would have provided a useful and decorative storage place in a formal bedroom. Its shape and size copy Japaneselacqueredboxes that were being imported into Europe at this time.Scholars believe that it was probably made in the workshop of Andr-Charles Boulle, a craftsman known for his elaboratemarquetrydesigns in exotic wood or tortoiseshell and brass. The flowers and birds that decorate the surface of this chest are similar to those that appear on other works by Boulle in the Getty Museum's collection.
Marquetryof extraordinary quality in wood and in tortoiseshell, brass, horn, and pewter decorates the top of this table. A band of brass surrounds a large central oval of tortoiseshell, andnaturalisticflowers in wood marquetry frame the table's outer surface. Peonies, daffodils, tulips, hyacinths, and ranunculus can all be identified. The flowers are composed of small pieces of woodveneerthat were assembled and then scorched with hot sand to create subtle gradations of shadow. Originally, the table would have been more vividly colored; light exposure has bleached the wood marquetry and faded the blue paint underneath the framing areas of horn to gray.Very few pieces of furniture are veneered with two types of marquetry. A single person seems to have made all of them, including this table, as they include many comparablemotifs. For example, four small birds on the top of the table are very similar to four birds found on the drawer fronts of the largeCabinet on a Standin the Museum's collection. Andr-Charles Boulle, a royal cabinetmaker working at theLouvre, may have designed and executed these pieces.
Because the recessed top of this table is removable, the table may also have been used as a stand for a cabinet. Withnaturalisticflowers and birds, the table's woodmarquetryis of extremely high quality and was probably made by the royal cabinetmaker Andr-Charles Boulle. The table's design and the combination of marquetry made of wood and marquetry in tortoiseshell, pewter, brass, and ebony point to Boulle's particular specialties. The design of the table's border is the same as that on two jewel coffers made by Boulle, also in the Getty Museum.
Standing on either side of a table or cabinet with matching ebony, tortoiseshell, pewter, and brass decoration, these stands, known asgueridonsortorchres,would have supported candelabra. Many elements of the design, such as thegiltbronze ram's heads and masks, appear in both the drawings and engravings of the celebratedbnisteAndr-Charles Boulle, who worked in the late 1600s in Paris.The 1777 sales catalogue of the French politician andfinancierLouis-Randon de Boisset describes stands of exactly the same height and unusual form. De Boisset's sale was one of the largest held in Paris in the 1700s. His collection, which included at least 230 paintings and fifty pieces of furniture by Boulle, sold for a record sum of 1,320,149livres.
When Dutchman Christiaan Huygens invented the more accurate long-pendulum clock in 1657, other clock makers soon followed, adapting the design of their cases accordingly. In this early example, the pendulum and weights have been enclosed in a long case for protection. The center of the narrow body swells to allow for the pendulum's swing, and it has a viewing hole to observe the movement.A phrase from Virgil engraved beneath the dial--Solem audet dicere falsum(It dares the Sun to tell a lie)--alludes to the accuracy of this type of clock and its ability to demonstrate the irregularity of the sun's orbit.On the basis of the marquetry pattern, the case can be attributed to thebnisteAndr-Charles Boulle. The inventories of Louis XIV identify a clock of the same design and similar marquetry, now in the cole Nationale Suprieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris.
Intended to hold jewels or small precious items, the interiors of this pair of coffers are lined with tortoiseshell and brass or pewter, with secret compartments in the base. The coffers are each decorated using techniques known aspremire partiemarquetry, a pattern of brass and pewter on a tortoiseshell ground, and its reverse,contrepartie,a tortoiseshell pattern on abackgroundof pewter and brass.When lowered on their hinges, the wide gilt bronze straps on thecofferfronts and sides reveal three small drawers for rings. Each coffer also has a lid that opens in two sections. The upper lid reveals a shallow compartment, while the main lid lifts to reveal the interior of the coffer.The 1689 inventory of theGrand Dauphin, the oldest son ofLouis XIV, lists a jewel coffer of similar form and decoration; according to this inventory, Andr-Charles Boulle made the coffer. The two stands are of the same date as the coffers, but were originally designed to hold rectangular cabinets. One stand was adapted in the late 1700s or early 1800s to make it the same height as the other.
These two octagonal pedestals have cupboard doors that open on one side to reveal hollow interiors. They were designed to display sculptures; from an auction catalogue of 1788, scholars know they have supported the same bronze figure groups that they support today. They would have stood in a formal reception room orsalon.Andr-Charles Boulle, the man who perfected the distinctive technique ofmarquetryin tortoiseshell and brass, probably produced these elaborate stands. Boulle work was made of thin sheets of tortoiseshell and brass glued together and then cut into elaborate patterns. Areas of the stands not decorated with this marquetry were thenveneeredin ebony, while elaborategiltbronze added to the lavish effect.
The motifs decorating these unmarked four-light candelabra--including sphinxes, ram's heads, and human heads in classical profiles--led scholars to attribute them to Louis XIV's cabinetmaker Andr-Charles Boulle. He often attached gilt bronze mounts in the form of sphinxes and ram's heads to the furniture he made. Guild regulations commanded that cabinetmakers could only make furniture from wood, but Boulle escaped these strictures when he was awarded the title of cabinet-maker and sculptor to Louis XIV in 1672.  He was then allowed the rare privilege of producing both furniture and sculpted works in gilt bronze, such as these candelabra.
This small, solidly constructed chest of drawers is known as a commode, literally meaning  convenient  in French. Commodes first appeared at the end of the 1600s, replacing large chests for storage. With interiors divided by drawers, the commode provided a better distribution of interior space in a more elegant and accessible form than the earlier large chests. The commode became a very fashionable form of furniture during the 1700s.In addition to its three drawers (a long one on top and two smaller ones below), this commode contains several other, less obvious storage places. The large, central gilt bronze mount is attached to the front of a narrow drawer, and the two lower drawers each have a deep base that was once hidden by a false bottom. The swelled concave and convex form is fairly typical for the early 1700s. The heavy form and massive sculptural mounts on this piece are typical of the workmanship of Andr-Charles Boulle, one of the most famous Parisianbnistesin the early 1700s.
Strings once hung down from the clock through the two holes pierced on each side of this lyre-shaped wall clock. When pulled, they activated a chime that enabled the owner to hear the time in the middle of the night or in a darkened room. Known as apendule d'alcove,this clock would have hung in an alcove above a bed. Appropriately enough for a timepiece, the lyre shape is associated withApollo, god of the sun.A complex clock such as this one was a collaborative effort on the part of numerous craftsmen, probably in Andr-Charles Boulle's workshop. The clockmaker, who produced only the movements, would have commissioned a sculptor to design the model, a bronze caster to produce the bronzemounts, and agilderto chase and gild them. Then an enameler would paint and fire the enamel numbers, each of which was inserted individually.
Each element of this chandelier-the curving arms, drip pans, and candle holders--is stamped with acrowned C, showing that the chandelier must have been either repaired or resold between 1745 and 1749. In February 1745,Louis XV, king of France, issued an order that all new and old objects made entirely or partly of copper be taxed. As a result, all pieces that passed through the workshops of the bronze casters and dealers between these years bear the small stamp showing that the tax had been paid.The chandelier's small size indicates that it was probably made for a library or private apartment. Its shape and square section arms are characteristic of the work of Andr-Charles Boulle. An engraving published in 1710 byDanielMarot inspired this design.
This cabinet originally contained twenty-four shallow drawers intended to hold coins or medals. One of a pair, its companion in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia, still retains its original interior fittings. At some point, the cabinet's entire interior was removed and converted into a cigar humidor.An inventory taken in 1767 on the death of the son of Robert de Cotte,Premier ArchitectetoLouis XIV, king of France, describes two medal cabinets made by Andr-Charles Boulle, probably referring to this pair.Apart from the masks in the center of the doors and the lions' heads on the sides, which are later replacements, all the mounts are unique to the pair. The gilt-bronzecaduceuswith entwined snakes, normally the symbol for medicine, is here associated withMercury, the god of commerce--an appropriate reference for the storage-place of coins.
The figures on this clock represent Love conquering Time, a theme often repeated on French clocks of the early 1700s. Thecupidbalanced on the top originally held a long-handled scythe, anattributeof Father Time, who reclines below and holds his usual scales. The case's front and side surfaces areveneeredwith tortoiseshell, brass, and ebony. A recessed panel of blue horn, decorated with a brasstrellisenclosing rosettes, is set below the dial. The legs are also set with panels of blue horn, which still retains its vibrant color.While the clock's dial appears to be contemporary with the case, the movement is not. The blank gilt-bronze cartouche beneath the face may once have held an enamel plaque inscribed with the name of the original movement maker. Later in the eighteenth-century, Paul Gudin set the present movement in the case and painted his name on the enamel dial.
Each of these twogiltbronze, two-branched wall lights is the mirror image of the other. The two twisting arms each end in leafy drip pan, with candle sockets of differing designs, a common feature of wall lights at this time.The wall lights are not marked with a maker's name, but the lower portion closely follows a design by Andr-Charles Boulle that was published around 1720. The printed design records that the wall lights were intended for a room with a low ceiling. Wall lights were usually attached to mirror frames so that the mirror's reflections would increase the effect of the candlelight.
Along with firelight, candles were the only sources ofilluminationafter dark in the 1700s. Wall lights such as these were usually fixed on either side of a mirror so that the reflection multiplied the flames of the candles.Scholars guess that the renownedbnisteand bronze caster Andr-Charles Boulle made these wall lights. In 1725 a book of engravings of Boulle's designs was published, one page of which showed seven different wall lights. Many features of this pair are similar to details in the engraved plate, including the three different drip pans resembling flowers, the tall vine-like middle arm, and the branches of curving acanthus leaves.
tienne-Louis Boulle illustrated his love of pure geometrical solids in this design for part of a Neoclassical church: the spherical dome rests on the crossing of two cylindrical barrel vaults supported by an arcade of regularly spaced Corinthian columns. Classical details abound: coffering adorns the vaults, figurative sculptures fill niches in the wall, and tiny figures in togas carry fiery torches up to a pagan altar that belches smoke through the sacred space. Because of its expense and the impracticality of its vast size, this ambitious plan for the church of the Madeleine in Paris was never executed.After becoming an architect instead of a painter at the request of his father, Boulle regularly managed to include small painterly details in his architectural drawings. Using gradations of washes, he effectively suggested the dramatic effect of sunlight entering through the central dome, illuminating the altar, and creating dark shadows behind the columns. The intricate details and atmospheric touches, combined with an accurate rendering of architectural finishes, suggest that Boulle used this drawing to communicate his ideas to a client.
Light illuminates the neck and shoulders of a woman looking down at the figure ofChristkneeling on the ground. The Pharisees had brought to Christ a woman caught in the act of committing adultery. When they asked whether she should be stoned, he stooped down and began to write with his finger on the ground. When they continued to ask, Christ said,  He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  The male accusers watch with varying expressions; some absorb Christ's words, while others recollect their own transgressions.Profoundly influenced by Caravaggio'srealismand dramatic lighting, Valentin de Boulogne used light and shadow and a shallow frieze-like arrangement of figures to convey the scene's emotion. Figures fade into the darkbackground, while faces, hands, and even a knee emerge from the dimness. The figures are highly individualized, especially the old man at the right who holds his glasses firmly to his nose in order to see better and the elderly man with the weathered face and scraggly hair who holds his cape back against his shoulder. For this biblicalnarrative, Boulogne used contemporary, working-class people as models, a practice initiated by Caravaggio at the turn of the century.
Lay spirituality spurred the popularity of personal books of hours in the late Middle Ages. Abook of hoursis a privateprayer bookwith a core group of prayers and readings structured around the eight daily devotional services practiced by the clergy. Books of hours also contain a calendar of Church feasts, prayers to saints, and a service for the dead. They were designed for the laity and were frequently tailored to a patron's individual interests.Jean Bourdichon,court painterto four successive French kings, illuminated this book of hours, which represents some of his earliest work. He produced gloriousminiatureswith sophisticated landscapes, dramatic lighting, and monumental figures. Illuminations in books of hours, usually placed at the beginnings of the individual prayers, provided a visual focus, aiding the reader in his or her meditations.The intertwined initialsIandKappear frequently in the borders of themanuscript, with theIembraced by a loop that forms the arms of theK. The letters are probably the initials of a husband and wife who commissioned the book. TheKprobably stands for Katherine since the book contains several prayers toSaint Catherine of Alexandria, after whom women in medieval France were often named.
KingDavidkneels before God to ask heartfelt forgiveness for his sins. An image of David, traditionally considered the author of the Bible's psalms, commonly preceded the sevenpenitential psalmsinbook of hours. These psalms were to be said every day as a means of obtaining absolution.
Domine labia me aperies et os meum annunciabit laude[m] tuam(Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise), declare the words beneath thisminiatureof theAnnunciation. This sentence, taken from a verse ofPsalm50, opensMatinsof theHours of the Virgin. Following the traditionaliconographyof the Hours of the Virgin, theilluminatorillustrated each of the eight devotions with an episode from Mary's life.The Virgin prays in her privateItalianatechapel, just as the manuscript's owner may also have done. The angel Gabriel interrupts her and announces that she will give birth toJesus. Above Gabriel and the Virgin, theHoly Spiritin the guise of a dove flies toward the future mother of God on a stream of golden rays of light. This supernatural light shines on the Virgin and angel below, creating highlights on their deeply colored gowns.The Virgin and angel's voluminous gowns give weight to their bodies, contributing to the miniature's three-dimensional quality. From Jean Fouquet, his predecessor ascourt painterat Tours, Jean Bourdichon learned to use geometry to create monumental figures, symmetrical compositions, and the credible illusion of three-dimensional space.
In manybooks of hours, like this one, aminiaturedepicting a scene from the life of the Virgin precedes each of the eight devotions of theHours of the Virgin. Here theVisitationprecedesLauds, which opens:Deus in adiutorium meu[m] intende. Domine ad adiuvandum me festina(God, come to my assistance. Lord, make haste to help me).According to theGospelofSaint Luke, the angel Gabriel informed Mary at theAnnunciationthat her elderly cousinElizabethwould bear a child. When Mary hastened to her cousin's house and greeted her, Elizabeth felt her child, John the Baptist, leap in her womb. In the miniature, Elizabeth kneels in homage before Mary, as she was the first to recognize Mary as the mother of God.In his depiction of the two women, Jean Bourdichon contrasted the Virgin's youthful beauty with the weathered visage of Elizabeth, who was well past childbearing years when she became pregnant. He also usedatmospheric perspectiveto suggest how the eye reads objects in the distance differently: within the background landscape, objects further away are less distinct while closer objects are carefully delineated.
Jean Bourdichon followed the venerable tradition of using sumptuous gold, combining it with an interest in representing the natural world. He painted gold stars against the deep blue night sky and gold rays piercing through the roof of the manger and extending to the infant. From the child emanate more golden rays that light up the interior of the building and illuminate the figures of Mary and Joseph, reflected as highlights on their clothing. Bourdichon carefully observed how light acts in the physical world, but he also endowed that light with a spiritual quality, indicating its heavenly origin.The miniature accompanies a verse from Psalm 69, which opens the prayers for Prime--as well as other hours--in the Hours of the Virgin:Deus in adiutorium meum intende. Domine ad adiuvandum me festina(God, come to my assistance. Lord, make haste to help me).
Thecourt painterJean Bourdichon represented the scene of theAnnunciationto the Shepherds in the dark of night as the rustic shepherds huddle around a campfire. Suddenly, the supernatural light of the angel in the sky overpowers the naturalistic source of light from the campfire. Announcing that theMessiahhas just been born, the angel radiates golden rays on the shepherd's upturned faces and highlights the figures' clothes. The representation of light effects was a central issue in Europeannaturalismin the 1400s, and nocturnal scenes represented a challenging aesthetic problem. Increasingly,illuminatorsused the Annunciation to the Shepherds as an opportunity to represent a scene in the dark of night.Theminiatureof the Annunciation to the Shepherds precedes a verse taken fromPsalm69, which opens the prayers forTercein theHours of the Virgin:Deus in adiutorium meum intende. Domine ad adiuvandum me festina(God, come to my assistance. Lord, make haste to help me).
The artist took an opportunity here to paint the Adoration of theMagias a nocturnal scene, although this was not a typical treatment of the subject. The star shown at the top of theminiatureis the one that guided the three kings to the manger. It is not only an important part of the story, but also becomes the element that reveals the major actors in the drama, for it casts its light on the Virgin and Child, all three kings, and the crown and gift of the eldest king. The king's humility is revealed in his act of kneeling and in the fact that he has taken off his crown.Christreaches out to accept the gift, and the other two magi wait behind, conversing with each other in front of their armed retinue.
At the top of the arched frame, God the Father offers his blessing from heaven and displays an orb, the symbol of his universal dominion. Below, an assembly of angels bears witness as the Virgin is crownedQueen of Heaven. This ceremonious and joyfulminiatureof theCoronation of the Virgin, an apocryphal event said to have occurred after her death, fittingly accompanies the last of the services of theHours of the Virgin, calledCompline. The text begins with verse five ofPsalm84:Converte nos deus salutaris n[oste]r et averte iram tuam a nobis(Convert us, God, our savior, and turn your anger from us).In this miniature Jean Bourdichon displayed his knowledge of the principles of Italian Renaissance painting, including the sophisticated use of symmetry and geometry for the composition. Bourdichon arranged the angels at the feet of the Virgin in an ellipse, but to offset the composition's symmetry, he twisted the axis of the crowning angels, further emphasizing the illusion of receding space. In this miniature, Bourdichon represented the divine light emanating from the Virgin as visible rays, which then softly model the draperies of the two angels and the faces of those below.
The ailingJob, having suffered many afflictions, including the loss of his children, his riches, and even his health, is reduced to resting on a reeking heap of dung. The course of events in thisOld Testamentstory began when God asked Satan if he had noticed the piety of the good man Job. Satan replied that it was easy for a successful and happy man to be faithful. God then took away Job's worldly comforts one by one to test his faith. In the end, Job recognized that he could not fathom God's workings, only submit in humility to his decrees.
One version of the legend of the virgin andmartyrSaint Avia tells that the saint, imprisoned for adhering to her Christian beliefs, miraculously received communion from theVirgin Mary. In thisminiaturethe crowned Virgin appears with an entourage of adoring angels carrying liturgical objects, including an incense holder and a processional cross. The Virgin herself offers thehostand holds thechalice.In thisbook of hours, the miniature accompanies an intercessory prayer written in French rather than in the more common Latin. The use of French rather than Latin illustrates the local and contemporary popularity of Avia, one of many fictitious saints who were widely venerated in fifteenth-century France.Intercessory prayers, appeals for assistance addressed to God or to specific saints, were grouped together in books of hours. The contents of these sections varied, since they were personalized with prayers dedicated to locally popular saints or to saints with personal meaning for thepatron.
This miniature of a radiant Bathsheba in her bath originally opened the seven penitential psalms in the manuscript known as the Hours of Louis XII. In the Middle Ages it was thought that King David wrote the seven penitential psalms in atonement for his sins, the greatest of which was seducing the young woman Bathsheba and murdering her husband. In this scene, Bathsheba is transformed into the temptress of King David, lingering naked in her bath and gazing unabashedly out at the viewer. Her abundant blond hair glows on the page, and her high, small breasts, and broad hips accorded with the highest standards of feminine beauty of the time. Clearly, she was intended to appeal to the book's patron, King Louis XII of France.The Hours of Louis XII was one of the greatest French manuscripts of its time. Only sixteen of the manuscript's original complement of miniatures have come to light, and the Getty has acquired three of them. The other two are a frontispiece depicting the king kneeling in prayer, and a miniature of The Presentation in the Temple.
This leaf with its stirring portrait of Louis XII would originally have opened a lavish book of hours court artist Jean Bourdichon painted for him. The depiction of the king in his parade armor probably celebrates his recent coronation in 1498, and reflects an official image of the new king. Louis is presented (from left to right) by a number of royal saints: Saint Michael, the patron saint of the royal chivalric order; Saint Charlemagne, from whom the French kings traced their descent; Saint Louis of France, the king's namesake and his forebear on the throne; and Saint Denis, the patron of the French royal household. The finely observed portrait of Louis XII shows Bourdichon at the height of his artistic powers.The Hours of Louis XII was one of the greatest French manuscripts of its time. Only sixteen of the manuscript's original complement of miniatures have come to light, and the Getty has acquired three of them. The other two are an image of the Presentation in the Temple, and a depiction of Bathsheba bathing.
This leaf depicting the Presentation in the Temple originally comes from a manuscript known as the Hours of Louis XII. The miniature's artist, Jean Bourdichon, introduces the subject in a close-up, personal way. Here Mary is seen in half-length, situated at the front of the space, close to the viewer. We seem to peer over her shoulder at the scene of the presentation of her infant son at the altar of the priest Simeon. The purpose of compositions such as this one--which were increasingly popular in the second half of the 1400s--was to bring viewers physically closer to the narrative and actively engage them in the event being portrayed.The Hours of Louis XII, so-called after its patron King Louis XII of France, was one of the greatest French manuscripts of its time. Only sixteen of the manuscript's original complement of miniatures have come to light, and the Getty has acquired three of them. The other two are a frontispiece depicting the king kneeling in prayer, and a depiction of Bathsheba Bathing.
And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain. . . .(Exodus 32:19)After forty days and forty nights on Mount Sinai, Moses returns carrying the Ten Commandments, only to find the Israelites worshipping a golden calf instead of the true god. Strong theatrical gestures express the various emotions and activities of the Israelites.Sbastien Bourdon used browns with white accents to evoke a full range of light, shadow, and form. Oil paint and pen and ink cover nearly the entire surface of the paper, making this highly finished drawing resemble a monochrome painting. Bourdon repeatedly depicted the dramatic events from Moses' life.
The angel Gabriel interrupts Mary at her devotions and announces,  You shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall give him the name Jesus.  (Luke 1:31) In an attitude of humility, Mary sits on the plain tiled floor, eyes downcast, and raises her hands in surprise. Gabriel, dressed in white with multi-colored wings, kneels and points towards the circular window above, indicating the presence of God. With his other hand he draws back the curtain of the canopy.Dieric Bouts painted the scene in a lucid and spatially convincing setting. The room at the left is simply described: a barrel ceiling, a marble column with two steps leading up to the room, and a stained glass window. A mood of solemnity, suitable for prayer, pervades the scene. In this somber setting Bouts's use of bright red for the drapery seems unusual. It may signify the Passion, forecasting the death of Christ, or it may be purely decorative since Bouts used this color in other compositions.The Annunciationbelongs to a set of five paintings that originally constituted a polyptych representing scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. It was probably the upper left panel of an altarpiece that included paintings of theAdoration of the Magi, Entombment(upper right),Resurrection(lower right), and perhaps theCrucifixionin the center.
Standing either with thumbs tucked into belts, arms folded across chests, or a hand shoved in the chest of a coat, these Union officers posed for Mathew Brady's camera in the Washington Navy Yard. Across the image's foreground, shadows from a cast-iron fence create a fanciful pattern. President Lincoln had called these volunteers from the New York Infantry into service in June 1861. At the time, many people thought that the conflict between North and South would soon be over, but in fact the Civil War had barely begun and would last until the middle of 1865.
The category of still life painting emerged during the Baroque period in Italy and Belgium. Adolphe Braun photographed works of art from numerous European collections, so he was certainly familiar with such paintings from those assignments. This image of the hunt, with a dead boar and bird, rifle, trumpet, and woodsy vegetation suggests the sporting scene. At first glance the assemblage appears to be an effusively illuminated initialEfrom a manuscript. Then the gruesome scene reveals itself. The reality of the boar's lifeless body is less picturesque in this highly detailed photograph than it might be in a similar scene in a painting. The photograph's ability to imitate nature so realistically makes for a sober, macabre image.
In the classic biblical tale of faith, daring, and skill overcoming brute strength and superior odds (1 Samuel), the shepherd boy David slew the armored Philistine giant Goliath with just a stave, a slingshot, and a pouch containing a few pebbles from a local brook. After stunning Goliath with a stone from his slingshot, David quickly took up the giant's sword and severed his head.Assured that his audience knew the story, Salomon de Bray could evoke a meaningful narrative by depicting only a boy with an oversize sword. De Bray's David embodies youth and naivet; he is an ordinary, rather blank-faced, Dutch youth, not an idealized heroic type.David with His Swordshares the same size, medium, and composition with the artist'sBust of Samson; they were probably paired aspendantsor as part of a series of Old Testament heroes.
Holding the jawbone as his attribute, Samson looks upward, perhaps to God. The great strongman slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass (Judges 15:19). Overcome by thirst, he then drank from the rock at Lechi, a name that also means  jawbone  in Hebrew. Due to a mistaken translation in the Dutch Bible, some artists depicted Samson with a jawbone, rather than the rock, issuing water.Salomon de Bray used a clear light, plain background and a half-length composition, showing his awareness of the artistic conventions of the UtrechtCaravaggisti.Bustof Samsonshares the same size, medium, and composition withDavid with His Sword;they were probably intended aspendantsor companions in a series of Old Testament heroes.
Bartholomeus Breenbergh set the story of God's first plague against the Egyptians in a luminous, spacious Italian countryside, filled withromanticclassicalruins inspired by examples he had studied in Rome. In a vast vista of space, the highlighted ruins stand starkly against the sky in the central ground. Using translucent layers of sensitive brushstrokes, Breenburgh masterfully fused figures and scenery, giving his imaginary setting a role equal to that of thenarrative.Despite their small size, the gestures of the figures in theforegroundtell the story. In the center,Mosespoints toward Aaron, who stretches his rod and turns the Egyptian waters into blood in order to convince Pharaoh to permit the Israelites to leave Egypt. Pharaoh, wearing a Roman tunic, an Oriental turban, and European ermine-lined cape, observes in astonishment as the hideous miracle unfolds.Dutch landscape painters often took their narrative subjects from theOld Testament, but they rarely depicted this incident.
Large Roman ruins loom in thebackground, against which excited figures engage in a brutal murder. In the shadowy rightforeground,Saint Stephenkneels in prayer; behind him a shirtless man takes aim with a large rock. All around, people scurry to pick up rocks to hurl at the defenseless saint. A small boy helps out by bringing stones to the adults.Bartholomeus Breenberg depicted the martyrdom of theearly ChristiandeaconStephen, the first Christianmartyr. In the left foreground, a man turns to face the viewer and points at the grisly scene before him. Scholars initially thought this was a self-portrait of the artist; they later identified this man as Paul who, before his conversion toChristianity, assisted at Stephen's stoning by guarding the clothes of the executioners.When Breenberg made this painting, landscape as agenre, and the DutchItalianatelandscape tradition that Breenberg helped develop, was gaining popularity but was not fully accepted as a justifiable subject by itself. Thus, the figures ornarrativewere often the excuse for painting a landscape.
Knights and peasants alike enjoyed tournaments, contests between armed horsemen that simulated real warfare and flourished as entertainment from the 1200s to the 1500s. So popular were these mock battles that they frequently appeared as the subject of stained-glass windows in cathedrals.Jrg Breu took this popular topic and created this lively scene for a round window. At the back, a trio of heralds on horseback announce the participants with their trumpets, while the referee raises his arm to signal the start of the action. A warrior clad in armor makes his entrance, holding a long lance astride a richly decorated horse. A jester jumps in front of him to entertain the gathered crowd. Earlier window designs of tournament scenes divided the jouster, heralds, and jester into separate quatrefoils. Breu abandoned this Gothic format to create a unified scene embellished with architectural and genre details. He worked quickly and spontaneously to create this drawing; in many instances his pen departed from the chalk underdrawing to create new lines. Particularly beautiful in this respect is the flowing drapery of the horse's blanket, which sweeps out as the knight gallops off.
In this design for a stained-glass window, Jrg Breu blended together two episodes of a tale entitledOf Tribulation and Anguish.A boy who was cursed at birth by the emperor later rises to become his son-in-law. Here the youth arrives on horseback at court on the left; on the right, he confronts the empress and her ladies-in-waiting as he rests somewhat uncomfortably in the marriage bed of the emperor's daughter.The nucleus of theRenaissancehousehold was the bedchamber, where all the most important functions of family life occurred, from birth to the consummation of marriage and death. The bedchamber was not only the symbolic center of the home; it was also the decorative center, a room with expensive wall treatments and a diverse collection of furniture. Breu set this story in a lavish interior suited to its noble occupants, with acofferedceiling and carved and molded walls. The bed, decorated with richly carved leafy scrolls and expensive textile hangings and set in an arched niche, is the most important and most ornate piece of furniture in the room.
The guardian angel figure, hand upraised as if in blessing, consoles the cowering woman within a protective stand of California western juniper trees. Their faces obscured, the women portray archetypes rather than individuals. Trees tortured by lightning and twisted by the winds recur in Anne Brigman's work, symbolizing independence and an adaptation to life's adversity.In order to achieve a sense of atmosphere appropriate to the scene, Brigman altered her negative by hand, drawing and scratching lines onto the negative before printing. She created thehaloabove the figure's head at left and the sweep of lines meant to appear as a translucent, windblown garment on the figure at the right.
As a Pictorialist artist, Brigman favored a poetic rather than a clearly descriptive approach to landscape, emphasizing formal elegance, elusive symbolism, and craftsmanship. Her romantic, soft-focus work celebrates a spiritual communion between humans and nature, as in this study of a nude figure enveloped within the gentle, undulating forms of her lakeside surroundings.
The interior of this Athenianred-figurekylixor cup depicts a young man in a rocky landscape wearing an outfit intended for hunting or traveling. The youth's identity is uncertain. The heroTheseusis frequently shown in such garb, but the figure could just as easily be an ordinary youth.The exterior of the kylix depicts a scene clearly drawn from daily life in Athens, not the mythological world. It shows the dokimasia, or annual inspection of the cavalry. The young cavalrymen, who wear caps with long earflaps, present their horses. Greek vases often depicted well-to-do Athenian men hunting, riding, or attending drinking parties--all favored pursuits of the elite social classes. A fine painted cup such as this would have been used at one of these drinking parties, known assymposia.
Komasts or revelers frolic around the exterior of this Athenianred-figurecup. The men dance and hold drinking cups, while female attendants provide the music. The unusual feature of this vase is the odd way the men are dressed. They wear longchitonsand turban-like headdresses, and attendants shelter them with parasols. Several dozen vases with similarly dressed revelers survive. Scholars call these scenes of men in fancy dress Anakreontic, after the poet Anakreon, who came to Athens from East Greece in the late 500s B.C. Scholars do not agree on how to interpret this costume. Because the men's clothing is similar to that of the women in the scene, some scholars see the men as transvestites dressing up as women. Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C. A quieter scene decorates the interior of the cup, with a young man offering a flower to a standing woman holding a mirror.
Lying on her side, this woman's dishevelment and fretful expression convey the suffering and hardship endured by thousands of migrant farm laborers who were forced out of their homes and off their land during the Dust Bowl-a period of severe drought that struck the Great Plains of the United States in the early 1930s. Horace Bristol made the photograph in a tent, either in a government-sponsored camp for migrant workers or in any one of a number of  Hoovervilles -the shantytowns named for President Herbert Hoover, who was blamed for the problems that led to the Great Depression.Bristol made this photograph while touring California's Central Valley with John Steinbeck. While Bristol made pictures, Steinbeck made copious notes. The research conducted on their trip contributed to Steinbeck's 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel,The Grapes of Wrath,an epic chronicle of one family's journey to California in search of farm work. Bristol's photographs were used extensively for casting when the book was made into a film in 1940. Named  Ma Joad  by Steinbeck, this woman was the backbone of her family, and the driving force behind their ability to get through the most difficult times.
Emerging from a pea field in California's Central Valley, migrant farm workers paid by the pound carry their harvest to a roadside scale. Horace Bristol made this photograph while traveling through the Central Valley with author John Steinbeck. Bristol had approached Steinbeck about collaborating on a book length project about California's farm workers. They spent five or six weekends together, interviewing workers and making photographs in labor camps and on the road. Steinbeck then withdrew from the project to concentrate on what would become his Pulitzer Prize winning novel,The Grapes of Wrath.Though his original collaboration with Steinbeck was abandoned, the photographs that Bristol had made appeared inLIFEmagazine shortly after the 1939 publication of The Grapes of Wrath. Bristol's images were used in casting producer Darryl Zanuck's film version of Steinbeck's novel. Bristol's images appeared inLIFEagain upon the film's release. These once-famous photographs remained in storage, nearly forgotten to the world, until 1985, when Bristol's son asked him if he had readThe Grapes of Wrath. This image is one of only forty surviving photographs from Steinbeck and Bristol's now immortal journey through California's Central Valley.
This jalopy and a makeshift tent of grubby blankets formed a home for the small boy staring out the car's window and his family. During the 1930s, such substandard living conditions were common. Another car, a tent, and a line of sheds can be seen in the distance. The Dust Bowl-a period of severe drought that struck the Great Plains of the United States in the early 1930s-and the Great Depression forced many Midwestern families off their land. In search of farm work, the only labor they knew, families headed west to California, Oregon, and Washington. Shantytowns like this, nicknamed Hoovervilles after the president blamed for the Depression, sprung up wherever people stopped in hope of work. Near the car's right front tire, a basin and washboard attest to this family's efforts to maintain some degree of cleanliness while living in squalor.Gift of the Horace and Masako Bristol Trust
At age forty-five, J. Paul Getty sat for this portrait at Gerald Brockhurst's London studio. Brockhurst was then at the pinnacle of his career as one of the world's top society portraitists. Getty's intense gaze at the viewer; the ivory skin; and the frontal, half-length pose are characteristic of Brockhurst's portraiture. His style perfectly suited the image of a conservative businessman: somber, near-monochrome colors meticulously applied to create an individual, yet classicized, physical likeness. Nothing is revealed of Getty's inner life, personality, or occupation.
With head tilted downwards, an anguished, bare-chested figure grips his skull with his two hands. The splayed fingers and muscular arm are the true subject, with only the sketchiest indication of the facial features and torso. Black chalk lines skillfully render the anatomical structure of the arm and fingers; and careful shading emphasizes taut flesh, joints, and fingernails. Despite his precise draftsmanship, Agnolo Bronzino leftpentimenti, evidence of rethinking, along the elbow and inner side of the right arm in the study.Bronzino made this drawing as a study of the figure who personifies Jealousy in his painting ofAllegoryofVenusandCupid.To accurately represent the anguished pose, the artist drew from a studio model, precisely positioning the model's hands and arms. AnX-rayof the painting shows that he first painted the hands higher and more horizontally across the head; he then probably worked out the position in this drawing and returned to rework the painting.
As soon as they were installed in 1534, Michelangelo's sculptures for the Medici Mausoleum in Florence captured the attention of other artists. One of those artists, Agnolo Bronzino, made this drawing as a study of the right hand of one of those sculptures. With precision he copied the crisscross pattern of the accentuated veins and even the square thumbnail.In order to make this study, Bronzino must somehow have raised himself to the level of the hand, since it is drawn straight on and close-up and not from a low viewpoint. Perhaps he used steps to gain a better view or made the study from a cast of the hand. He combined more than one view of the three-dimensional hand, including both the upper surface of the thumb and the bulging muscle along the lower contour of the hand, which in reality cannot be seen at the same time. This gave difficulties when he tried to foreshorten the crooked forefinger, and faint traces of an early attempt still remain.In contrast to the careful presentation on the recto, the draftsman swiftly and spontaneously sketched four heads on the verso of this sheet.
Saint John the Baptist's artificially posed figure is confined in a space that seems too small to contain his muscular frame. His torso twists to bring it parallel with his bent leg and arm, thus exposing a portion of his back. Although unnaturally posed, Agnolo Bronzino'sserpentinefigure of Saint John achieves a graceful fluidity typical of the style calledMannerism.The unusually tall format of this work results from its original position as the left panel of thealtarpiecein the private chapel of Eleonora da Toldeo in the Palazzo Vecchio. Representing thepatron saintof Florence, this panel was paired with one of Saint Cosmas, the name saint of Eleonora's husband, Cosimo de'Medici.
Using delicate chalk strokes, Agnolo Bronzino built up the head of a young Florentine nobleman. Soft, careful lines create the curling strands of hair on his head, the pale fuzz on his chin, and his broad, piercing, almond-shaped eyes with their large irises. Numerous lines of cross-hatching create the darker shadows on the right side of the face and the long, elegant neck. Bronzino probably made this drawing from life; slight pentimenti in the right ear and eye imply adjustments made in front of the live model.Bronzino drew this head as a study for a painted portrait of the young man, but no one has yet discovered the man's name. Technical analysis of the painting reveals that he made numerous changes on the canvas as he developed his composition. The Getty Museum's drawing therefore gives scholars an important idea of the artist's earliest conception of the portrait, probably even before he began to paint.
Gazing out for eternity, the man depicted on this Romano-Egyptian mummy portrait holds the symbols of his salvation. He has a glass filled with red liquid, presumably wine. Wine, and the color red in general, was associated with life in Egyptian thought and more specifically with rebirth in a funerary context. The garland of pink flowers in his other hand marks the man as an initiate in the cult of the goddess Isis, who offered her followers a happy, carefree afterlife.Although scholars do not know where this portrait was excavated, several features match those of portraits from Er-Rubayat in the Fayum. The angular trimmed upper corners of the panel correspond to the way embalmers at this site cut down portrait panels to make them fit in the mummy wrappings. The portrait is painted in the frontal, unrealistic style favored at Er-Rubayat. Although it is difficult to convey three-dimensionality in the tempera technique, the Brooklyn Painter carefully used shadows andhighlightsto give a sense of depth to the man's face.
The surprising truncated effect of this drawing, in which a pleated skirt illogically stands on its own, indicates that Hans Brosamer probably drew it on a live model and simply omitted the body. As this drapery study does not relate to any known painting or print by Brosamer, he probably drew it for his own interest and practical experience.Brosamer's practice of drawing objects from life and his use of contemporary clothing as subject matter show that he was abreast of the artistic trends of his own period. At the same time, his tendency to treat individual pieces of drapery as self-contained outlined forms illustrates his delight in the complex folds of cloth alone. In a closely hatched style, Brosamer detailed not only the intricate pleated effect of the folds but also the bunching pattern as it hits the ground.
With the cloth bunched at the top, flared at the bottom, and suspended at the sides, this piece of drapery appears to represent a woman's skirt. Even though it seems to be hanging rather than worn by a model, the way the two sides lift up evokes the gesture of a woman gathering her skirts. Scholars guess that, in place of a living model, Hans Brosamer often drew from actual articles of clothing that he arranged to suggest wearing or motion.Brosamer's practice of life drawing and his use of contemporary clothing as subject matter show that he was abreast of the artistic trends of his own period. At the same time, his tendency to treat the individual pieces of drapery as self-contained outlined forms illustrates his delight in examining the complex folds of cloth alone. In a closely hatched style, Brosamer enumerated not only the intricate patterns of the folds but also smaller details such as the skirt's vertical seam.
In this small painting, the figure ofChristis almost lost amid the dense, multi-colored crowd. Identified by a pale yellowhalo, Christ stands on a rustic podium near the crowd's center. He presents his sermon on the conditions of blessedness. Behind Christ, his disciples pay rapt attention, but many in the diverse throng prefer to socialize with one another. In theforeground, a gnarled gypsy tells fortunes and a vendor sells pretzels. To the right, below a distant vista, a man in a long coat and dark hat directs two women in elegant gowns toward the crowd.Jan Brueghel the Elder painted this festive scene on a thin sheet of copper. The work's bright colors, fine details, and enamel-like finish are accentuated by the hard copper support. Brueghel's unmatched ability to describe figures and landscape in great detail transforms the painting into a jewel-like object intended for close scrutiny.
Amid the disarray ofVulcan'sforge,Venusleans into the embrace of her lover,Mars, who is transfixed by her alluring gaze. Caught up in his attraction to the aggressively seductive goddess, Mars is no longer able to carry out his military exploits. Venus removes his helmet, while mischievousputticavort with his sword and shield.In the 1600s, the subject of Venus disarming her lover Mars was understood as anallegoryof Peace. Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder's interpretation of the subject, however, emphasizes the fragility of peace. Weapons production continues in thebackgroundat the burning fires of Vulcan's hearth, signaling that love's conquest of war may be only temporary.Rubens and Brueghel, who were close colleagues, collaborated on at least twenty-five paintings. This painting displays each virtuoso's talents: Rubens's robust figural style and Brueghel's intricate still life details. The luminous figure of Venus, the reflective quality of the weapons and armor, and the tactile quality of the lush painting testify to their skill.
A profusion of animals fills the earth and sky. Fighting, playing, climbing, flying, and swimming, they are shepherded byNoahtoward the ark in the far distance. All species of animals are portrayed, from large lumbering elephants to tiny turtles and hamsters in theforeground. Bats and birds soar across the sky, receding into thebackgroundwhere brighter skies hold promise of a future.The story of Noah's ark provided a subject well suited to Jan Brueghel the Elder's descriptive abilities. Overcome by the wickedness of the human race, God resolved to cleanse the earth with a great flood. He spared only the lives of the family of Noah, the sole just man. God instructed Noah to build an ark and to take on board a male and a female of every species of bird and beast.In 1609 Brueghel was appointedcourt paintertoArchduke Albertand theInfanta Isabella, who had collected exotic and unusual animals from across the world, creating a menagerie in Brussels. Brueghel studied and drew many of these animals from life. With the discovery of the New World in the 1600s came an increased curiosity about natural history. This interest led many European rulers, who had in the past collected stuffed animals, shells, and other natural objects, to form menageries of rare live animals.
Shown separately or together, as inLandscape withAllegoriesof the Four Elements,the four elements were a popular subject for Jan Brueghel the Younger and his collaborator Hendrik van Balen. Here, earth is represented by the goddessCeres, who is surrounded with asatyr,putti, and a figure holding a sheaf of wheat. Ceres, whose name means  creator,  was the goddess of agriculture, worshiped over a large part of ancient ItalyTogether Jan Brueghel the Younger and Van Balen often painted the four elements, which had also been part of the repertoire of Jan the Younger's father, Jan Brueghel the Elder. Brueghel the Elder taught his son the lush, decorative, yet highly detailed landscape and still life style seen in this painting.Van Balen, one of Jan the Younger's most consistent collaborators, was known for his attractive nudes. This panel was probably one of his latest works; he had begun painting figures for the Brueghel family years before, working with his friend Jan the Elder in addition to collaborating with Frans Snyders and Frans Francken II.
Four seated women representing water, air, earth, and fire are surrounded by a lush landscape. The fish flowing from the water jug and the cornucopia of abundance cradled in the arms of the figure on the right correspond to the tactile elements of water and earth. The birds in the sky and trees and the accoutrements of battle in the foreground correspond to the intangible elements of fire and air. The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape.Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers. The widely admired Brueghel the Younger depicted the senses, the elements, or the seasons as allegories many times throughout his career, either together or individually, as in the pendant to this painting,Landscape with Ceres (Allegory of Earth).
Two brightly colored figural groups from the GinoriPorcelainfactory depict violent episodes from the Roman poetOvid'sMetamorphoses.Modeled in porcelain,Jupiter'smessengerMercuryattacks Argus on one pedestal, whilePerseuskillsMedusaon another. The factory reused Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze casting molds, replicating theBaroquesculptor's muscular figures, wind-blown dramatic draperies, and dynamiccompositions. Yet the painting, using jewel-like yellow, purple, blue, and pinkpigmentsandgilding, brings out a spirited delicacy more typical of theRococostyle of the mid-1700s. As a result, Medusa, whose horrifying look was reputed to turn men to stone, is merely a rather startlingly rosy-cheeked woman with snakes for hair, while Argus, the hundred-eyed giant who tormented Jupiter's lover Io, is a handsome, muscled warrior.Each figural group is made from ten separate sections, each of which was press-molded and fired before being joined together. The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum. The two lively groups would have been a dramatic centerpiece for a dinner-table setting.The group was painted in the shop of Johann Karl Wendelin Anreiter von Zirnfeld.
This cleverly conceived pendant displays a diminutive owl perched regally amid jewel-encrusted vines. Small spherical pearls hang from the ends of the foliage, suspended from small loops so that they could swing freely. In the Renaissance, goldsmiths began to experiment with a variety of new cuts for gemstones. A table-cut stone rests on top of the owl's head, and three others lie along the branch at the bird's feet. The intricate and unusual cuts of the jewels on either side of the owl, in the shape of a quatrefoil and a rosette, suggest that someone commissioned this drawing to show a possible setting for actual stones.Contemporary paintings and drawings reveal that pendants were among the most popular forms of jewelry in the Renaissance. Women in particular favored pendants, wearing them suspended from a chain around their necks or pinned to a sleeve, where the dangling pearls and sparkling gemstones would catch the eye with their movement and brilliance.
Komasts or revelers frolic around the exterior of this Athenianred-figurecup. The men dance and hold drinking cups, while female attendants provide the music. The unusual feature of this vase is the odd way the men are dressed. They wear longchitonsand turban-like headdresses, and attendants shelter them with parasols.

A quieter scene decorates the interior of the cup, with a young man offering a flower to a standing woman holding a mirror.
He must not be seen! I will cover his body, I will wrap him completely in my mantle. No one who loved him could bear to see the dark blood pouring from his nostrils and the raw wound in his breast.So declared Tekmessa when she discovered the body of her dead lover Ajax in an Athenian tragedy by the playwright Sophokles. Ajax was one of the greatest of the Greek heroes in theTrojan War. The matter of his suicide was recounted in epic poetry now lost to us, but Athenian vase-painters in the early 400s B.C. frequently drew on this tradition in showing his death.The interior of thisred-figurecup attributed to the Brygos Painter shows Ajax impaled on his sword and Tekmessa running to cover the body. In a unique representation of the suicide, the sword enters through his back rather than the more natural position through the stomach. Beneath Ajax, the Brygos Painter attempted to convey the texture of the pebble beach where Ajax went to die.The exterior of the cup presents the events leading to Ajax's suicide. When Achilles was killed, Ajax saved his body from the Trojans, expecting to be rewarded with Achilles' armor. However,Odysseusalso claimed the armor. One side of this cup shows the two heroes quarreling; on the other side, the Greek leaders cast votes in the form of stones piled in front of the opponents. The despondent Ajax clutches his bowed head, having lost by one vote.
A youth stands before an altar on the interior of thisred-figurekylixor cup. The lyre in one hand and the phorbeia, a face-strap used by flute players, that he holds over the altar identify him as a musician. The act of offering gifts to the gods was an essential element of Greek religion. Although pious worshippers could give animal sacrifices, libations or liquid offerings, or elaborate, expensive gifts, the gods also appreciated small items of great personal importance. Greeks made such offerings when praying for something to occur or in thanks for a good outcome. This scene may represent a youth asking for, or giving thanks for, a victory in one of the frequent musical contests in which well-bred Athenian young men competed.Although the depiction of a religious ritual on a cup used at a drinking party may seem odd today, the Greeks saw no conflict in this. For the Greeks, the drinking and merriment of the symposion was itself an offering toDionysos, the god of wine.
A Polish folk dance originating in the 1500s, the mazurka came to represent Polish national pride and dignity. Especially after Frdric Chopin made this music known in the early 1800s, the dance's popularity spread to the ballrooms of Russia, Germany, France, and England.Arranged in formal rows echoing the architectural pillars, these young women participate in a dance lesson, most likely in preparation for a society ball.
This grim scene of injured American soldiers reveals the horrors they faced in the brutal Vietnam War. The troops had gathered on a mud-covered hillside, which they had used as a makeshift First Aid center while attempting to take areas known as Hills 400 and 484. While this image focuses on the bandaged, bloodied African-American soldier in the center, diagonally positioned limbs of men on the left side of the image direct attention to a mud-covered soldier lying injured on the ground.Photojournalist Larry Burrows framed this image in a manner that emphasizes an apocalyptic, scorched earth in the colors of brown and muted cyan. But there is a hint of vividness in the bright white, bloodstained bandage of a soldier centered in the picture. Prior to Vietnam, war images were typically made using black and white film, so Burrows use of color enhances the impact of this scene.More than any other war until then, the Vietnam conflict was brought to American citizens through the eyes of photojournalists. Their poignant and arresting imagery in magazines likeLifeandLook,television, and newspapers gave Americans an unromantic vision of daily warfare. Burrows and three other photojournalists lost their lives five years later when their helicopter was shot down en route to cover the war's expansion into Laos.
Probably made for a noblewoman in the late 1200s, theBute Psalteris a small prayer book containing all 150 psalms. A number of other additional texts illuminated by an anonymous Parisian painter were added in the mid-1300s. The manuscript's name derives from that of a previous owner, the Marquess of Bute.A talented and important artist, known as the Bute Master for his work in this book, created the illuminations for the portion of the manuscript dating from the 1200s. He painted 190 historiated initials and numerous marginal drolleries. Instead of giving precedence to the eight major divisions of the psalms as was customary, he devoted a figural scene to every psalm. Furthermore, the illuminations display distinctive, original iconography that may reflect the patron's wishes.
Within the initialDopening Psalm 26, Samuel annoints King David, traditionally believed to be the author of the psalms. The heartfelt poetic text on the right reads:Dominus illuminat[i]o mea et salus mea. Quem timebo(The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom will I fear ). On the left, the illuminator playfully extended the lines of the historiated initial into the margin, painting a series of swirling vine leaves. On the vine extension across the bottom of the page, a woman with a drum gracefully sways, her right hand held to her ear. The gesture of listening and the reference to music may refer to the singing of the psalms in devotional practice.
A large historiated initialDopens Psalm 38:Dixi custodiam vias meas ut non delinq[ua]m in lingua mea(I said,  I will take heed to my ways that I not sin with my tongue ). Inspired by these words, the Bute Master depicted King David, traditionally considered the author of the psalms, pointing to his mouth. With his other hand, David gestures toward the ground and the seated woman at the bottom of the page. She in turn points toward a soldier. Presenting his back to the viewer, the soldier twists his head up and to the left while pointing his spear toward David. This series of gestures creates a visual circuit that links the figures as it guides the viewer's gaze around the page.
Inside the initialQopening Psalm 51, a priest prays before an altar, seemingly unaware of the soldier about to attack him. The figure depicted may be Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1170 he was stabbed to death in Canterbury Cathedral; soon afterward, he was canonized as a martyr and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage site. The theme of Christian persecution continues in the lower margin, with an animated scene of archers shooting arrows at two nude figures whose haloes identify them as saints. The illuminator may have taken his inspiration from the opening lines of the psalm,Quid gloriaris in malicia qui potens es in iniquitate(Why would you be glorified in malice, you who are powerful in iniquity ), interpreting those who are  powerful in iniquity  as persecutors.
 Save me, O God, for the waters have come up unto my soul,  sings King David in the opening line of Psalm 68. The illuminator illustrated this prayer for salvation by showing David in the bottom of the initial, nude in the rising waters, his graceful gestures expressive of helplessness. In the top half of theS, God descends from the clouds. While his body echoes David's curving posture, God's raised right arm with his hand ending in a gesture of blessing functions as a sign of his saving power.In the space of the lower margin, a figure prays to heaven while a monkey prepares to strike him from behind.
David, who was believed to be the author of the psalms, is shown here in an initial to Psalm 80 accomanying himself on the harp. The elegant instrument terminates in an animal's head like that of the whimsical winged creature below the initial. Above David, a man is shown heaving rocks, which may refer to the line,  He relieved his shoulder of the burdens,  in the text of the psalm.
In one of the smaller initials in theBute Psalter, the initialEof Psalm 44, King David sits before a city. Singing as he plays the harp, David appears not only as the author of the psalms but also as their performer. Angels clustered nearby accompany him with musical instruments, including a vielle (fiddle), a buisine (straight trumpet), and percussion.At the bottom of the page, a queen and her court of noblewomen pray from open books. Through such images, the original owner of this manuscript, most likely a noblewoman, could recognize the importance of her own devotional act of reading the psalms.
The Svres porcelain manufactory first produced the design for this pair of cups and saucers in 1752. The design was named after Pierre Calabre, one of the shareholders of the Vincennes porcelain manufactory that preceded Svres. The bold decoration of green panels with a deep pink ground was a popular fashion for only two years, from 1759 to 1761.A hostess usually served tea in the cup; the guest then poured it into the deep saucer to cool and used the saucer as a drinking dish.
This devotional drawing portrays an unidentified female saint experiencing a vision of a male saint, possiblySaint Francis, interceding between her and theVirgin Mary. The artist thoughtfully rendered facial expressions and garments such as the monk's robe and the Virgin Mary's mantle. The broken pen lines used for outlining, however, convey a sense of vagueness appropriate to the depiction of a spiritual vision. The execution of the hands, simply represented by three or four hulking fingers, further underscores the subject's ambiguity.The purpose of the obscure figure in the upper right corner, who remarkably displays both musculature and skeletal features, is unknown. This part may be apreparatory studyfor a corner of a curved ceiling. The object held by the Virgin Mary, a second unknown feature of this drawing, might provide a clue to the identity of the female saint and the meaning of the vision. The monumental figures, the close-upcomposition, and the use ofsepiawashwere common to artists working in Madrid in the early 1600s.
Underneath a prince's crown, two winged figures of Victory hold up the coat of arms of the Rezzonico family. A simple border of curved lines encircles the sculpturedmedallion.An unknown Italian artist quickly sketched this design to work out his ideas. Using a pen and brown ink, he experimented with different angles for the outstretched arms of the Victories and for the crown. Loosely applied areas of wash define the women's breasts, wings, and legs. A band of wash around the edge of the circle lifts the design to suggest a more three-dimensional form.From the 1500s onwards, drawings became essential tools for artists to communicate their ideas to patrons and other craftsmen. This design could have been used forfrescoor stucco work or for decoration on an object such as amaiolicaplate.
Tullia, daughter of the ancient Roman king Servius Tullius, orders her chariot to run over the body of her murdered father.After persuading her husband, Tarquin the Proud, to overthrow her father so that they might become king and queen, she ignored his advice to avoid the crowd surrounding her father's body in the streets of Rome. Though even her horses shy away from the deed she is about to perform, Tullia seems determined to finish the job of completely destroying her father.Focusing on the horror of the scene--taken from the Roman historian Livy--Giuseppe Cades crammed the composition full of figures and movement. The horses rear, manes streaming out, and Tullia and her groom gesture at the body of Servius, their capes billowing in the wind. The use of white heightening, which illuminates the flowing mane and muscular body of the central horse and the murdered king's body, amplifies the dramatic effect of the darkened scene.Scholars believe that Cades made the drawing to be sold as an independent work of art rather than in preparation for a painting. Other artists made such highly finished drawings for the art market in the 1700s in Italy.
At least three specialized craftsmen collaborated to produce this elaborate gilt bronze wall clock. The clockmaker Julien Le Roy, who signed the clock face and the movement, made the interior movement mechanisms. The bronze caster Jacques Caffieri cast and gilded the ornate case, which would have been the most costly part to produce. In this rare example, he engraved his signature on a cartouche below the dial. Antoine-Nicolas Martinire, the enameler, painted the numbers on the clock face and fired the whole dial. He inscribed the back of it with his name and the date1747.A detailed inventory of Jacques Caffieri's workshop made in 1747 describes a clock similar to this one, decorated with the figures of Minerva andCupidholding a scythe. Minerva, thepatronof learning and the arts, wears a helmet and armor and perches on a cloud on the top of the dial. The winged figure of Cupid, probably once holding a scythe in his hand, symbolizes Love conquering Time.
Louis XV'seldest daughter Louise-Elizabeth brought these four wall lights, each stamped with an inventory number, from France to Italy for her summer palace. She and her husband Don Philippe were made Duke and Duchess of Parma in 1748. A year later, when they took possession of the city's royal residences, they found that both the winter residence in town, the Casa Reale, and the summer residence in the country, the Palazzo di Colorno, had been stripped of their furnishings. Louise-Elizabeth made three trips toVersailles, obtaining money and gifts from her father to furnish the new palace. She returned to Italy with more than fourteen wagon-loads of goods commissioned from French craftsmen.Composed of stems of laurel leaves entwined with roses and a central drippanin the shape of a sunflower, the elaborate wall lights were probably made by one of the finest bronze casters of the mid-1700s, Jacques Caffieri.
This microscope was made for an aristocratic amateur scientist, who would have used it in hiscabinet de curiositto explore the mysteries of the natural world. Thesecabinetswere single rooms, or even an elaborate series of rooms, containing a variety of natural specimens including shells, fossils, minerals, bottles of preserved animals, and a variety of stuffed exotic animals including armadillos and crocodiles.The Getty Museum's microscope still works, and the case is fitted with a drawer filled with the necessary attachments such as tweezers, extra lenses, and slides of such items as geranium petals, hair, fly wings, and fleas. Some of the slides are from the 1800s, indicating that the instrument was in continual use for over a century.With attachments such as an ocular micrometer, the microscope incorporates the latest scientific technology of the mid-1700s. The design of its curving gilt bronze stand was the height of theRococostyle when it was created. A microscope of this same model belonged toLouis XV, King of France, and was part of his observatory at the Chteau de La Muette.
Taking advantage of the speed with which he could model the soft material ofterracotta, the sculptor, probably Jean-Jacques Caffieri, fashioned an informal and spontaneous portraitbust. He rendered the sitter's face--where the sitter's character is most fully revealed--with great care, while the clothes, hair, and especially the back of the head were treated more sketchily. These areas show the sculptor's handling of the clay, creating incised lines on the front of the clothes and smooth planes on the cheeks. Although the sitter's identity is unknown, the face closely resembles portraits of the painter Franois Boucher.Made to adorn a French interior, this type of bust was very popular in the 1700s. Because terracotta was relatively inexpensive, both middle class and wealthy consumers could purchase artworks made of this material for their homes.
Rising from a rounded socle, Alexis-Jean-Eustache Taitbout's head turns. A relaxed smile softens his bulbous features, and his eyes are sparkling and alive. His prominent nose, furrowed forehead, bushy eyebrows, and soft, aging flesh suggest a sympathetic, kind disposition. To suggest informality, Jean-Jacques Caffieri left the surface rough and rendered the sitter in casual garb. Caffieri, who was known for his portraitbustsof contemporary celebrities, especially those of writers and artists, represented Taitbout as one of theliterati, even outfitting him in the loose blouse worn by artists and writers. He modeled the bust interracotta, taking advantage of the medium's flexibility to render a portrait striking in its spontaneity. The intimacy of this portrait is characteristic of the Enlightenment interest in psychology. Indeed, the portrait's psychological penetration suggests that the sitter or a close intimate probably commissioned it.Taitbout was an aristocrat, a knight of the order of Saint-Lazare, who served as French general consul to Alger, Algeria and then to Naples. The sculptor likely modeled the portrait from life and chose to memorialize Taitbout's warm humanity.
A young woman with a sensually curved figure and a lovely, gentle face represents Hope. With her traditionalattributeof an anchor, she nurses a wingedCupid,personifyingLove. A common figure fromantiquesculpture, he has dropped his bow and arrows below him on the rock as he reaches up to nurse. Sculptor Jean-Jacques Caffieri inscribed the title of his marble on the base:Hope Nourishes Love. Hope's nursing breast is a familiar symbol of sustenance and comfort.Allegoriesof love and friendship were favorite subjects in sculpture and painting around the 1750s, providing sculptors with a noble conceit that encouraged a contrast between the platonic ideals of love and its earthly, sensual elements. The sensual tone of this work is characteristic of theRococostyle fashionable at the French court ofLouis XV.
In about 1767, the king of Poland commissioned one of the most famous bronze casters of the 1700s, Philippe Caffieri, to supply numerousgiltbronze objects for his palace in Warsaw. Included among them were wall lights of this design. A drawing that Caffieri made to show his ideas for these fittings still exists in Poland. A letter that Caffieri wrote to the king in 1769 states that the craftsman had sent nineteen pairs of similar wall lights, twelve large and seven smaller, decorated with urns and garlands, to the Polish royal household.
Along with firelight, candles were the only sources of illumination after dark in the 1700s. Wall lights such as these were usually fixed on either side of a mirror so that the reflection multiplied the flames of the candles. This set of wall lights would have been used in a large room fitted out with paneling and furniture in the newly fashionableNeoclassicalstyle.
In the myth of The Seven Against Thebes, a group of heroes banded together and attacked the city to reinstate the rightful king. The front of thisred-figureamphorashows an episode from the myth. Holding a burning torch, the hero Kapaneus climbs a ladder, while two defenders and the usurping ruler look down from the wall. Kapaneus was killed for boasting that he did not need the gods' help; for his hubris,Zeus, the king of the gods, struck him down with a thunderbolt, which he here hurls down from above. The punishment of Kapaneus is rarely seen in ancient art. The main scene on the other side of the vase showsmaenadsandsatyrs, the companions ofDionysos, the god of wine. Beginning in the 600s B.C., Greeks colonized parts of southern Italy and Sicily. From about 450 B.C., these colonists began producing their own fine decorated pottery, which eclipsed the imported Athenian wares by the next century. This pottery, known as South Italian ware, first grew directly out of Athenian shapes, style, andiconographyand then developed its own visual forms.
The steepperspectiveof the cross and the suggestion of heaven's spatial infinity indicate that Eugenio Cajs probably made this square drawing as apreparatory studyfor a ceiling painting, probably in a chapel dedicated to the cross. In his late work, Cajs characteristically employed these graceful figures, these rhythmically flowing forms, and thischiaroscuroeffect in brush andwash. His convincingillusionismin rendering the cross required extensive knowledge of perspective, which he may have gained from his study of Italian architecture.
Renaissanceartists revived themosaictechnique from theearly Christianperiod, considering it particularly appropriate for commemorative portraits since mosaic tiles, composed of ceramic or glass, preserved their color more permanently than paintings. Giovanni Battista Calandra here depicts Camillo Rospigliosi, brother ofPope Clement IXand Knight Commander of the Order of Santo Stefano, whose cross insignia adorns his chest.Despite the medium's technical challenges, Calandra reproduces some of thenaturalistictechniques of contemporary painting. He may even have copied a painting, as was common practice among mosaicists. Calandra positions the sitter at a slight angle, employingperspectiveto represent theforeshortenedchest and shoulders. In addition, he carefully renders the gradations of hair color resulting from changes in light andsfumato, the effect of light giving way to darkness behind the sitter. The embroidered cross showing through Rospigliosi's collar is a notabletour de forcein subtle coloring. The portrait may have been part of a funerary monument or, alternately, Rospigliosi may have displayed it in his home.
Callahan referred to this photograph, made shortly after an inspiring encounter with Ansel Adams, as  my first good picture.  Unlike Adams's dramatic landscapes, Callahan's composition focuses on an overlooked pedestrian setting in his native Detroit. Raising the horizon line, the artist achieved a delicate, calligraphic interplay among the reeds and telephone poles and their reflections across the surface of a bog.
This image came about because I was interested in the ambiguity of meaning and of space. It was a way of calling attention to the fact that a reclining body with eyes closed can appear dead, or appears to be sleeping and dreaming peacefully. There is an element of fear in these photographs, juxtaposed with beauty.--Jo Ann CallisComparing the artist's earliest work with the subject of the nude, the  Morphe  series consists of black-and-white studies staged with a model partially submerged in water. In this image, the composition incorporates a floating, floral-patterned cloth and plant reflections on the water. Depending on the attitude of the viewer, the human model in these dark images might express death or dreaming.
My work is about interiors--psychological and physical. I create my own interior stage-set; a world in which I can control all the elements; a world that is magical, yet still rooted in the very practical reality of everyday life.--Jo Ann CallisWoman with Blue Bow,from Callis' first efforts in color compositions, presents a close-up of a young woman's tanned neck with the narrow blue ribbon of her lacy white party dress tied too tightly below her chin. In the wallpaper-pattern of a blue bamboo forest behind her, two yellow lovebirds flutter above her left shoulder and appear to be kissing with their small pointed beaks. By juxtaposing implied sensations, such as constriction and mobility (the ribbon and birds) and warm and cool (the colors of skin and foliage), Callis seems to sabotage traditional symbols.This photograph and similar ones were made after Callis' first exposure to the work of Paul Outerbridge, when the contents of his estate came to light in Los Angeles. Outerbridge's not-quite-natural color photographs inspired Callis to use color for her own expressive images. The erotic, fabricated vein running through his commercial and personal work convinced her that she was on the right path.
I wanted to take familiar objects and combine them in a way [in which] one might see them in new relationships to each other. The relationships can be a bit incongruous, but they at least make sense on a visual level. The pictures can be metaphorical, of ordinary occurrences in life existing at the same time as the extraordinary.--Jo Ann CallisIn this unconventional  still life,  three separate black-and-white images are printed side-by-side on a single sheet of photographic paper. From left to right, three images present individual items: a white cake on a glass plate, a light-grey Fedora hat, and a round, white pillow. Jo Ann Callis says ofCake, Hat, Pillow:  I didn't want any one of the objects in the composition to be more important than any other, so I had to separate them and give each its own independent space. These particular subjects were selected because they look very similar in the way they are photographed--and in their shape--but their meanings are quite different from one another. Domestic objects fascinate me because we see them all the time and we have strong associations with them. Referring to the combined black-and-white still life studies made in 1982-83 asThe Gridseries, Callis selected familiar household objects that, individually, gave her comfort. By combining these objects and adding strong, focused overhead lighting, she infused drama or an imagined conversation, between the objects. The resulting assemblages cause the viewer to give common objects new weight and, perhaps, new meaning.
I wanted to allude to a person being constantly required to perform in life and to have the stage-fright fear that accompanies what we imagine are the high expectations of others. How one appears to the outside world may be different from what one feels internally.--Jo Ann CallisIn the mid-1980s, Jo Ann Callis created a series of images that featured human figures in movement. The anonymity of the people in these fictitious scenes enables viewers to identify with them and share their seeming conflict or anxiety. The scenes she created were often domestic, and the models were dressed to carry out seemingly ordinary routines. Occasionally taking this idea of performance photography to its logical extreme, she asked her models to do magic or sideshow tricks in highly theatrical sets featuring spotlighting, heavy gold drapery, and purple backdrops. In this example, Callis invented what she called a  kind of metaphor for life.  Her young model has the agility to do a handstand with no apparent strain, yet her intent, Callis says, was to have the woman  look as if she were at ease while at the same time . . . performing something that is difficult for her to carry off. 
I chose a shiny moir fabric in a mauve color. The shine of the material relates to the glazed sugar on the dessert, and the patterned weave adds an element of sharpness and contrast to the softly cushioned fabric. The sugary treat seems to have  weight  because it sits in a gently indented space that looks somewhat flesh-like.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called  Forbidden Pleasures --occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements. Callis has said that these soft, sweet, colorful pastries, each lit and staged on a fabric of complimentary texture and design, is about the  idea that desserts and eating desserts carries some of the same psychological baggage as guilt.  In other words, eating rich desserts in this health-conscious time can be considered a crime of sorts. In these images, there is also a tongue-in-cheek reference to human sexuality. The seductive ingredients of the pastries and their fabric environments simulate the look of flesh. Although the motivation for this project may have been an impulsive urge to have fun with both the glossy Cibachrome medium and the subject of sweets, Callis was no doubt drawing on the tradition of abundance found in earlier still life painting and the extravagant color of more recent painters representing popular culture.
There are two cream puffs sitting side-by-side, with a red cherry sitting on the top of each as a finishing touch to a great mound of delight. Each cream puff is fully loaded, with a shell acting as the base and an abundant amount of whipped cream rising generously from it. It all sits on pink, fake-fur fabric. It speaks of abundance, with the huge whipped-cream filling that swirls around the center of each puff.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called  Forbidden Pleasures --occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements.

Sometimes in today's culture, the words used for eating indulgences such as fattening, unhealthy desserts are similar to the words used for forbidden sex. I wanted to make the desserts look as sexy and seductive as they do in reality. I wanted the viewer to respond to their texture and to their imagined taste; to the feeling one might get from smelling and tasting them. Doughnut  pictures a round, glazed doughnut with a little drip in the front, falling onto gently colored, pink-and-grey fabric. How can one photograph sexy desserts and not include a doughnut --Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called  Forbidden Pleasures --occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements.

The linear-shaped dessert sinks into a pale purple fabric, with a soft, golden paisley pattern swirling around. There are a few gentle rolling folds in the elegant fabric to reiterate the clair's form and weight.--Jo Ann CallisThis image is one of a series of photographs of dessert pastries--called  Forbidden Pleasures --occasionally displayed together to invite comparison of shapes, colors, and other visual elements.

Around the year 2000 Callis's concern with photographing the heads of infants led her back to an early interest in painting. She tackled larger-than-life canvases, working in a hyperrealistic manner; at the same time, she explored inkjet (digital) printing as she worked on this new subject matter. With oil paint she attempted to re-create the look of perfect newborn skin.After scanning her negatives for digital printing, she manipulated the volume of the small heads, the color of eyes, and the peculiarities of undeveloped human characteristics. Isolating the infants' heads from their bodies also encouraged an alien appearance, not inappropriate for new beings whose lack of sophisticated communication makes us wonder just what they are thinking.
This powerful image clearly displays Jacques Callot developing the motif of a rearing horse. He first laid out the sheet horizontally, with the present left side at the top, and lightly sketched the back of the head of a horse in the center of the page. He then turned the sheet vertically and drew the whole animal with a fine, quill pen. Finally, Callot went back over the outlines with a thicker reed pen, adding emphasis and creating a sense of rippling movement with dark, sure strokes. The streaming mane and tail and the unusual vertical format emphasize the upward movement of the rearing horse.Upon completing the large stallion, Callot returned to the quill pen to execute the tiny equine figure in the lower right. More fluid still, the horse and rider capture the movements of its larger counterpart in remarkable detail, down to the glimpse of the underside of the front left hoof between the horse's hind legs. The drawing demonstrates Callot's marvelous capacity to miniaturizemotifsin a dashing, shorthand manner.
Jacques Callot's bravura handling ofwash, the expansiveness of the setting, and the large number of participants belie this sheet's tiny size. Callot typically created small prints and drawings whose action and setting may be best appreciated with a magnifying glass.The location and subject depicted in this drawing are unknown, but the camels indicate an Eastern locale. With rich use of wash and dramatic compositional rhythms, Callot invented a complex scene of an army marching in procession from a castle or walled city with captives and booty. Banners aloft, they regroup to trumpet fanfares in the lower right corner. Huge tongues of flame, seen clearly in the black chalk underdrawing, burst from the battlements.In style, subject, and horizontal format, this drawing resembles compositions from one of Callot's masterworks, hisMiseries of Waretchings of 1633. He completed the series soon after Cardinal Richelieu's devastating invasion of the Lorraine region and the capture of Callot's hometown of Nancy.
Jacques Callot often featured complex and highly expressive rock formations in his prints and drawings. Only through sensitive observation of natural phenomena was he able to capture a wide range of effects of light and shade with an economical, rhythmic use ofwash. Remarkably, despite his freedom and fluidity in applying wash, there is no evidence that he was ever a painter.The forthrightness and simplicity with which Callot described forms on the page and his masterly use of light reveal experiments in landscape parallel to those of his two great French contemporaries, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. Both Poussin and Claude lived in Italy, where Callot worked from 1612 to 1621.While this drawing's purpose is not known, both it and Callot'sAn Army Leaving a Castlemay have been studies for engravings that were never made.
On the paper on which this print is mounted, Julia Margaret Cameron inscribed the words:  My very first success in Photography.  Cameron had received her first camera as a gift just one month before writing these words. Like most photographers of the time, she struggled with the mechanical operation of the camera and the chemistry involved to create an image.In the 1860s, photographers were required to work rapidly because all of the chemicals had to be used while they were still fresh. They had to compose the subject for the photograph, hoping the sitter could maintain his or her pose long enough for them to make the exposure. The complexity and urgency of the process led to many technical mistakes, and Cameron's early attempts were no exception. Even though the sitter's face is slightly out of focus, and streaks from the application of the chemistry are evident, it was with great pride and satisfaction that Cameron declared this portrait of tousle-haired Annie Philpot to be the first completed print that she considered successful.
When I have such men before my camera, my whole soul has endeavored to do my duty towards them in recording faithfully the greatness of the inner, as well as the features of the outer, man.--Julia Margaret CameronHolding a book as if he is standing at a lectern, Oxford theologian Benjamin Jowett comes across as reserved, even somewhat severe. His heavy jowls touch his collar, and his white bowtie echoes the tome's shape. Julia Margaret Cameron's image of Jowett, like other photographs she made of prominent men, suggests reverence bordering on hero-worship.In addition to Jowett's bookish appearance, Cameron captured his eccentric personality: He was, in fact, a man with unorthodox views. For a decade, Jowett taught the Classics at Oxford University until his dismissal on grounds that his religious beliefs were too radical. Jowett rented a cottage on the Isle of Wight to work on translations of Plato and be near his and Cameron's mutual friend, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
Alfred, Lord Tennyson once described Charles Hay Cameron as  a philosopher with his beard dipped in moonlight.  As Cameron sits in an armchair facing his wife's camera, his white hair is drenched in brilliant natural light. Although it is winter and he is bundled in an overcoat, his eyes express tender warmth.This portrait by Julia Margaret Cameron is a rare study of her husband, and one of the first she made after taking up photography. In her later allegorical images, Charles Hay Cameron's patriarchal appearance made him a convincing King Lear and Merlin. But in real life, he fit the Victorian archetype of  genius  with his unruly white hair, as did many of the scholarly men his wife photographed. Cameron attended Eton College and served a distinguished law career in British colonial India. He shared a passion for literature and philosophy with his wife and friends. He also had a tendency to be reclusive. Here, he is portrayed simply as himself--a gentle and solitary man.
Julia Margaret Cameron probably made this contemplative portrait of Ellen Terry as a new bride during the Shakespearean actress's honeymoon stay at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight, where Cameron lived. Terry had married the portrait painter George Frederick Watts, who was thirty years her senior; the marriage, orchestrated by Cameron and her sisters, was a brief and unhappy union.Terry's forlorn expression and nervous gesture may be an actress's performance put on for the camera. Her demeanor, indicated by the titleSadness, which Cameron gave to another print of this image, may also indicate Terry's realization that her marriage was a mistake. Employing a non-fading print process used for commercially distributed pictures, Cameron's printer made multiplecarbon printsavailable for purchase by Terry's and Cameron's fans.
The subject of this photograph derives from the French romantic novelPaul et Virginieof 1787, which was translated and widely read in Victorian England. The models are Freddie Gould and Elizabeth Keown, local children from the Isle of Wight, where Julia Margaret Cameron photographed. The novel centers around a shipwreck, during which the heroine must shed her clothes to be rescued; she refuses to sacrifice her modesty and drowns. Cameron does not attempt to illustrate an actual scene from the text; instead, she suggests the novel's tropical setting through a bamboo-handled parasol, scattered greenery underfoot, and the models' appropriately disheveled drapery. Cameron often took well-known works of literature or painting as inspiration for individual images and then interpreted them loosely to communicate a universal underlying theme.
Cameron found in the camera a tool to express her beliefs in the idealizing and transformative power of art. Cameron portrayed her family and intimate friends, directing them to stage her own imagery. The British poet Henry Taylor was an important model for her. Here he appears as Prospero from Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Cameron's pictorial exploration of the medium, her rejection of conventional focus, and her theatrical use of light were atypical for the time.
This image recreates the scene of the Nativity, in which Christ's mother, the Virgin Mary, and her husband Joseph watch over the newborn, sleeping Christ child. Julia Margaret Cameron may have decided to include a fourth figure, the young girl at the left, to add pictorial balance to the composition. The girl may represent an angel, as her outstretched hand hovering above the infant's head appears to be a gesture of blessing. The sleeping child's peaceful repose is emphasized by the contemplative silence of the surrounding figures. A spiritual calm is conveyed in the image by the adults' downcast eyes. Cameron powerfully evokes the mood of the Nativity scene through her careful, sensitive rendering of a sacred subject.
George Frederick Watts was a renowned portrait painter as well as a friend and mentor to the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Cameron photographed Watts frequently and in different guises. Here she cast him in the role of musician with hismuseor guiding spirit looking intently over his left shoulder, as though she is  whispering  some artistic encouragement in his ear. He, in turn, looks down upon the figure of the child on his right, who appears to be entranced by his violin playing.The violin is the visual focus of the composition and establishes a connection between the visual and performing arts. The concept of  muse  derives from Greek mythology and indicates the influence ofclassicalsources in Cameron's work. On the mount board under this image, her inscription,  a Triumph!,  demonstrates the degree to which she felt this photograph captured the relationship of artist and muse.
Come into the garden, Maud, I am here at the gate alone; And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad, And the musk of the rose is blown.-Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in MaudThe woman in the garden is a common theme ofVictorianpoetry and painting, often representing beauty andromanticlove. Magdalene Brookfield, a family friend of Julia Margaret Cameron, is the dark-haired woman strolling through this garden. Her pyramid-shaped figure is centered in the photograph, and so is Cameron's focus. Brookfield's face, hand, and a part of a nearby bush are sharply defined. The rest of the image blends into soft-focus, emphasizing her mysterious, pointing gesture.Perhaps Magdalene represents the subject of a man's obsession, as in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1855 poem, Maud, in which the ephemeral qualities of love and a woman's beauty are ascribed to nature. Like Eve in the Garden of Eden, the woman in nature becomes part of a moral theme of the virtuous woman versus the fallen woman. Cameron probably made this outdoor, full-figure study at the London home of her sister, Sara Prinsep.
When in Rome, in 1819, a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of The Cenci. We visited the Colonna and Doria palaces, where the portraits of Beatrice were to be found; and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story.--Mrs. Percy ShelleyJulia Margaret Cameron often directed female models to represent tragic heroines whose sorrow made them beautiful. Cameron composed this image around the sitter's downcast eyes and scrolling hair--which spills out from under a turban. Cameron's niece, May Prinsep, plays the role of Beatrice, the central figure of Percy Bysshe Shelley's play, The Cenci (1819). Prinsep's sorrowful expression conveys the character's resignation to her fate.Beatrice Cenci, the daughter of a Roman count, lived in Florence during the late 1500s. After Beatrice conspired with her mother and brother to have her father killed, the trial brought to light his cruelty, which included an attempt to rape her. Although the story won public sympathy, the family was nonetheless executed. Cameron was fascinated by this true story and made several photographic studies based on it.
The astronomer Sir John Frederick William Herschel was a lifelong friend of Julia Margaret Cameron. They met in 1835 in South Africa, where Cameron was recovering from an illness and Herschel was conducting astronomical investigations. Herschel was not only a preeminent astronomer but also made several significant discoveries in photographic processes, most notably the invention of thecyanotypeblueprint.Even before she began to make photographs, Cameron kept apprised of discoveries in photography through her correspondence with Herschel. In this portrait of her dear friend, Cameron sought to portray  faithfully the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man.  Cameron draped Herschel in a swath of dark cloth, which served to highlight his white hair and to focus attention on his face. Herschel's unruly hair and eyebrows and fiery eyes are features commonly ascribed to a popular image of  genius ; they effectively convey strength of character and intellectual intensity.
Julia Margaret Cameron photographed many eminent intellectuals who belonged to her circle of family and friends. She had to wait long and patiently, however, for the chance to capture the historian Thomas Carlyle with her lens. Carlyle, famous for writingOn Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, sat for Cameron only once, and during the sitting she made two photographs: this frontal portrait and a profile view.Carlyle's face is cast in deep shadow. The dramatic lighting, which both illuminates and obscures his face, gives the portrait an emotional intensity. Carlyle was an intellectual hero to Cameron. Believing she had successfully captured him in a heroic posture, Cameron inscribed some prints of this image with the caption:  Carlyle like a rough block of Michelangelo's sculpture.  This powerful, head-on view reveals a strength and intensity of character that mirrors the straightforward, sometimes antagonistic discourses in his writing.
A Series of Life sized heads--they are not only from the Life, and startle the eye with wonder and delight--I hope they will astonish the public and reveal more the mystery of this heaven born art--They lose nothing in beauty and gain much in power.--Julia Margaret CameronAt the height of her career, Julia Margaret Cameron made this near life-size photograph of her adopted daughter, Cyllena Wilson. Cameron's virtuoso lighting captures the sculptural qualities of her model's ample physique, throwing the contours of the face into highrelief. Wilson's bright forehead and the bridge of her nose form one surface plane, her cheeks, another. Her skin resembles the luminance of marble.Cameron may have gained inspiration from the Elgin Marbles--Greek sculptural reliefs from thefriezeof the Parthenon--as did many artists in the 1800s. Around the time of this photograph, Wilson posed for two photographs that Cameron composed after the Marbles.Greekclassicismalso inspired Cameron's mythological subject: A bacchante is a female follower of the wine and fertility god,Bacchus. In this image the bacchante is represented in ceremonial attire, with star-shaped jewelry symbolizing her flamboyant nature.
Julia Jackson, the daughter of Cameron's sister Maria (Mia), was Julia Margaret Cameron's namesake and favorite niece. She was a renowned beauty, and much sought after both as artist's model and as potential bride. Cameron's admiration of Jackson is evident in the many portraits she made of Jackson; in fact, she was Cameron's most frequent subject.Here Cameron depicted Jackson in the year of her first marriage. She is shown at the height of her beauty, before later tragedies, including her husband's premature death, brought a solemnity and melancholy to her face. Cameron employs the same strong directional lighting that she used in her portrait of Thomas Carlyle, casting half of the subject's face in deep shadow.
Julia Jackson, the daughter of Julia Margaret Cameron's sister Maria (Mia), was Cameron's namesake and favorite niece. Cameron may have made this portrait just prior to Jackson's marriage to Herbert Duckworth.The institution of marriage was extremely important to Cameron and the Victorian women of her circle. In this profile portrait, Julia Jackson appears heroic and stately, as a girl on the verge of womanhood. She faces the light, which brilliantly illuminates her and metaphorically suggests the enlightenment Cameron believed marriage would bring to her. Cameron trimmed the photograph to the oval shape, creating an intimate frame for the subject.Only a few years after this photograph was made, the marriage ended tragically with Herbert Duckworth's sudden death. Jackson later remarried and bore two children, the painter Vanessa Bell and the writer Virginia Woolf. Jackson was the model for the character of Mrs. Ramsay in Woolf's 1927 novelTo the Lighthouse.
As evolutionary science and increasing secularism transformed the way Victorians understood the world, Cameron remained a devout Christian. She photographed influential public figures of her day as well as the women of her household, casting them in allegories of literary and religious subjects. Like her artistic contemporaries, the Pre-Raphaelite painters, who modeled their work on medieval religious and mythological art, Cameron intended her photographs to evince a connection between the spiritual and the natural realms.
So rich are her likenesses in tone ... that they attain ...  the value of works of art. These productions are made  out of focus  as the technical phrase is, and although sadly unconventional in the eyes of photographers, give us hope that something higher than mechanical success is attainable by the camera.--Unsigned,  ThePhotographic Society, Athenaeum, June 4, 1864This photograph imitates the soft, dark tones of a charcoal drawing from which a hazy figure emerges. Marie Spartali is centered in the frame, creating a symmetry that adds a sense of calm to her contemplative expression. Similar shades of gray visually echo one another--like Spartali's pinned-up hair, full lips, and the flower detail on her dress.Although Spartali's specific physical traits are blurred, Julia Margaret Cameron did not intend to represent her as an ambiguous,allegoricalfigure. Cameron liked to pose her Anglo-Greek friend in roles fromclassicalmythology. In this case, the photograph's title declares the sitter's true identity. Perhaps that is because, in addition to modeling for severalVictorianpainters, Spartali was an accomplished artist in her own right.
Our roles were no less than those of two of the Angels of theNativity, and to sustain them we were scantily clad, and each had a pair of heavy swan's wings fastened to her narrow shoulders ... No wonder those old photographs of us, leaning over imaginary ramparts of heaven, look anxious and wistful. This is how we felt, for we never knew what Aunt Julia was going to do next.--Laura (Gurney) TroubridgeYoung Rachel Gurney's forlorn expression does not quite fit her role as an angel, but in a humorous way, her performance supports this photograph's staged look. She is perched on a box that is covered loosely in drapery and positioned stiffly on a table, with fake wings attached to her. Resting her chin on her crossed arms, she appears resigned to her fate of posing for the camera.Julia Margaret Cameron made a suite of photographs based onputtifromRenaissanceand post-Renaissance paintings. As children, Rachel and her sister Laura were often recruited to play the cherubs. Years later, they remembered the patience it took to pose for their great aunt.
Cameron was surrounded by children and identified strongly with her role as a mother. Children made natural subjects for her work because they were readily available, and she could easily cajole them into participation. She often cast them as angels, viewing the young as closer to God due to their proximity in years from birth. Here Cameron posed a maternal Venus, played by her maid Mary Hillier, attending to a sleepy cupid.
Cameron would have been interested in that notion of theholy familyas working class, humble, peasant people. She used her maid Mary Hillier as Mary Madonna, and two local children as John the Baptist andJesus. I think she was interested in that contradiction between the high and the low--between the clean and the dirty, the mortal and the divine, the ordinary and the extraordinary.--Victoria Olsen, From Life: Julia Margaret Cameron andVictorianPhotographySoft-focus and dramatic lighting imbue this photograph with apainterlyquality reminiscent of works byRenaissanceartists. At least that may have been Julia Margaret Cameron's intention as part of her strategy to elevate photography to the status of high-art. By contrast, Cameron's subjects--the Madonna with infants Jesus and John the Baptist--appear humble in their simple clothing and quiet demeanor.Cameron's interest in the working-class origins of the Holy Family stemmed from contemporary biblical scholarship and art that focused on the historical context of Christ's life, frequently portraying him as a carpenter's son.
In 1874, at the Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson's suggestion, Julia Margaret Cameron undertook a series of illustrations for his epic poemIdylls of the King. A friend and neighbor of Cameron at Freshwater, Tennyson published the collection of poems in 1872; the poems had taken him nearly forty years to write. The images that Cameron created for theIdyllsare the most illustrative works she made; she took great care with the details of costumes and props to insure the photographs' faithfulness to his narrative. She employed a variety of people as models, going to great lengths to ensure the appropriateness of sitter to subject. This image depicts the final embrace of the tragic lovers before they are forever parted:And Lancelot ever promised, but remain'd,And still they met and met. Again she said, O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence, And then they were agreed upon a night(When the good King should not be there)to meetAnd part forever, Passion-pale they metAnd greeted; hands in hands, and eye to eye,Low on the border of her couch they satStammering and staring; it was their lasthour,A madness of farewells.
This photograph was made shortly after the death of Julia Margaret Cameron's only daughter, Julia Norman, in childbirth. Her widower, Charles Norman, is seated in the center with their two daughters. In their mother's absence, the daughters emotionally support their father. With their arms entwined around him and hands clasped near his heart, they envelop him in a tender, comforting embrace. Cameron probably directed this gesture, which adds great emotional impact.Family was the cornerstone of Cameron's art and life. This and other photographs of the Normans represent a bonding among the remaining family. Making the series may have helped Cameron cope with her sense of loss. It was Charles and Julia Norman's gift of a camera that became the catalyst for her photography. Cameron later wrote in her annals:  My first lens was given to me by my cherished departed daughter and her husband, with the words, 'It may amuse you Mother, to try to photograph.'  
Dramatic lighting emphasizes this Ceylonese girl's physical features. Her shiny pearl necklace and white shirt stand out against her dark skin and bare feet. The child's legs are tucked close to her body, and her arms are folded protectively around her waist. Julia Margaret Cameron's tight framing confines the subject within a small space, making her slight unease more noticeable. But the full-figurecompositionalso suggests a distance between photographer and subject that is both physical and cultural.Cameron made this photograph near the end of her life, when she lived in what is now Sri Lanka. This Tamil child may have been the daughter of a worker on her family's estate. Although Cameron had a benevolent attitude toward the Ceylonese, she supported the British Empire's civilizing mission in Asia, as was typical of her time. This picture appears to blend an ethnographic point of view with Cameron's more intimate approach to portraiture of family and friends.
The nude chubby boy standing on a convex base, the crowning figure of an altar complex in the church of San Giacomo di Rialto in Venice, was probably intended to represent theChristchild. In his left hand the child once held anattributethat might have revealed his identity. Considering his open gesture, which closely resembles the pose of Christ blessing, the missing object may have been a cross, a globe, or a crown. The sculpture was cast in one piece using thelost wax process. As in his other works, the sculptor Girolamo Campagna conveyed a sense of movement through the organization of the figure's body. The boy's torso twists gently while his arms and legs move in opposite directions, suggesting motion rather than a static pose. In contrast to the body's sensuous modeling, especially at the hips, thighs and ankles, the boy's face is defined by the smooth planes of his high forehead and heavy-lidded eyes.
Domenico Campagnola captured Saint Christopher staggering through the water, dropping the front of his robe as he tries to balance the evident weight of the tiny baby on his back. According to legend, St. Christopher was a giant who devoted himself to carrying the poor and weak across a river. One day, a small child seemed to grow heavier and heavier as Christopher waded through the current. The child finally revealed himself as Christ and told the saint that he had been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.Deftly handling the point of the quill, Campagnola indicated both the lighting and volume of the saint's muscular body simply by varying the length and curve of the same strokes of parallel hatching. Swirling lines indicate the wavy curls of the saint's hair and beard, his sturdy calves, and the loose drapery about his waist.
Elaborate stone fixtures carved by the ancient Romans inspired Renaissance artists to create complex decorations called candelabra. These ornamental forms were usually composed of elements drawn from metalwork and architecture. On this sheet, Domenico Campagnola created three designs from stacked vases and pedestals, alternately upright and overturned. He then arranged combinations of putti, human figures, trailing foliage, and bucrania around each form.Artists designed such intricate candelabra not just as functional objects like candle or torch supports; they also appeared as decorative motifs. Such forms ornamented the margins of printed books and filled the edges of frescoes. Parallel hatched lines down the sides of each candelabrum in this drawing give each form a sense of depth. But the clarity of the lines also suggests that the drawings could have transferred for engravings. Pattern books containing prints organized by their ornamental themes became popular in the Renaissance, when craftsmen used these books to create ornaments in a variety of media.
Neptune, the Roman god of the sea, grasps histridentwhile resting one foot on the scaly head of a dolphin. He stands on a pedestal against apilaster, the base of which is mainly defined by the dolphin's body. On each side are the hastily drawn lines of a vertical piece of architecture, while farther to the right are the dark shadows of his arms and trident.Giulio Campi probably produced this sketch as apreparatory studyfor the decoration of one of the triumphal arches erected in Cremona on the occasion ofEmperor Charles V'sentry into the city on August 18, 1541. Decorated with statues and representations of his famous deeds and insignia, these arches marked the ruler's route through the city gates to his lodgings. The number ofpentimentiin this rapidly drawn work suggests to scholars that Campi completed the drawing in some haste, probably working under a tight deadline. For example, he produced two further alternatives for the position of the head, both in profile and tilted farther back, but he did not bother to reinforce either in darker chalk.
The Madonna of Humility, an extremely popular subject in Flanders, sits on the ground on a cushion, presenting the haloed Christ Child in her arms. A crescent visible below her skirts at the left symbolizes the moon on which the Virgin stands in representations of the Immaculate Conception. The open and closed books symbolize the Old and New Testaments, and the lilies to the right symbolize Mary's purity. The apple in Christ's hands and mouth alludes to original sin and his future sacrifice.In this painting, the artist preserves the rich colors and detailed focus of his predecessors, theilluminated manuscriptpainters, while attempting to create a coherent spatial world. The river winds into the background, yet the townscape in the distance is rendered with as much clarity as the trim on the Virgin's drapery. Minutely observed details demonstrate the early Netherlandish interest in creating a convincing illusion of three-dimensional reality on a flat panel.
Sharply receding to the left, a row of buildings with shops along the ground floor exhibits a multitude of architectural details. This view of the north side of Saint Mark's Square features its celebrated clock tower, topped by bronze figures that strike the hours. Yet the church bells on the far right actually belong to a rooftop two buildings away. By moving the bells to the side of the drawing, Canaletto emphasized the receding perspective. He frequently distorted and rearranged monuments to suit his refined sense of composition.Canaletto probably enlisted the aid of a camera obscura, a ruler, and a compass to produce this sketch, reworking it later in his studio. He often referred to drawings for guidance and inspiration. He may also have used this sketch as a pattern for a larger painting from his workshop. Canaletto left many notes on the sketch, including one to remind himself of the drawing he made on the verso--a market scene of elegant gentlemen mingling with vendors among an array of merchandise.
Canaletto specialized invedute, or views, of Venice that he sold to tourists on the Grand Tour in the 1700s. For a brief time in the 1740s, he painted scenes of contemporary life set around the principal monuments of ancient Rome, based either on drawings made during an earlier visit to Rome or on engravings by other artists. Both groups of his views appealed to the traveler as well as the antiquarian.Seen through the central bay of the Arch of Constantine is the Colosseum, which Canaletto shifted to the left in the interests of compositional design. Figures converse, stroll, or carry out daily chores in the vicinity of these ancient buildings. To the left, a lone man sits on ruins with his back to the viewer, perhaps sketching or writing. Wealthy tourists and their servants laden with goods contrast with the poor Roman natives who have nothing, such as the woman who lies against the Arch or the man with a cane at the right. In this painting, Canaletto seems to remark on the gulf between Rome's ancient glory and the city's current impoverished state.
One sunny day in the mid-1700s, Canaletto set up his easel in the inner courtyard of Warwick Castle to capture the activities there. Although the strong horizontal line of the architecture forms the focus of the drawing as it divides earth from sky, Canaletto also filled the scene with many intricate details. A huntsman walks across the courtyard, dressed in a long frock coat and three-cornered hat, his rifle slung over one shoulder and his dog trotting beside him. A couple stand conversing against the back wall, while another woman in a full skirt and white apron enjoys the sunshine underneath the tower on the right. The rooftops of the city below can be glimpsed through the arched gateway of the central gate. These small details not only give a sense of the wall's great height but also humanize the scene.Canaletto probably made this drawing as a preparatory study for a subsequent painting of the same subject. Although the painting contains more figures, it is very close to this drawing in every other respect.
AsOvidtold the story in hisMetamorphoses,when the beautifulnymphDaphne finally escaped the pursuing Apollo by turning into a laurel tree, the Roman god of music and poetry pledged his unrequited love:Although you cannot be my wife, you shall at least, be my tree; I shall always wear you on my hair, on my quiver, O Laurel.In this marble, half-life-size statue inspired by this episode of theMetamorphoses,Apollo crowns himself with a laurel wreath. Nude except for sandals, his lyre hangs on the tree trunk that supports a piece of rumpled drapery. He stands incontrapposto,a balanced stance characterized by the opposition of straight and bent limbs, in a moment of reflection after the dramatic chase.Apollo'snudity, his broad, muscular chest, and his relaxed, balanced pose all recall famous antique representations of the god. But while sculptor Antonio Canova clearly emulated several antiques, hisApollois not a copy of an already existing statue. The commission for the marble was the result of a competition organized by Don Abbondio Rezzonico, nephew of the Venetian Pope Clement XIII. It is Canova's first fullyclassicizingwork, carved in theNeoclassicalstyle for which he soon became famous.
Vestal Virgins, consecrated to Vesta, Roman goddess of the hearth, served in temples as guardians of an eternal, sacred flame and were expected to emulate the goddess's purity and chastity. In his representation of one of these women, sculptor Antonio Canova suggested her innocence through the austerity and sparseness of theNeoclassicalstyle, drawing on the contemporary idea thatclassicalforms carry with them the expression of a strict morality. Thebustis made of simple geometric shapes: a square for the bust and oval for the face. The tightly wound headcovering pulls in her hair and, with the cloak, draws attention to the purity of the shapes. Her firm shoulders and uninhibited, unmoving stare further suggest her resolve, innocence, and moral authority. Despite her physical beauty and the softness of the folds of the cloak, the statue does not invite touching. It is a cool, intellectual work of simple forms and restrained emotion.With the discovery of the so-called House of the Vestals inPompeii, Vestal Virgins became a popular subject in the 1700s and 1800s. This figure wears a historically accurate cloak, which suggests that Canova researched the subject.
This seated youth orignudoshields his face from the blinding light ofHercules'arrival onMount Olympus. Here Domenico Maria Canuti conceived him as a real-life youth, muscular and rounded, with emotional energy implicit in his contorted pose. Soon after making this drawing, he portrayed the sameignudosomewhat differently in a corner of one of his first major works, theApotheosis of Herculeson the ceiling of the grand salon of a palazzo in Bologna.Canuti based his drawing style firmly in Bolognese tradition. Like his predecessor Annibale Carracci, he depictedignudias real people, with often disconcertingly animated expressions and movements. Canuti'scaricatureof a man playing a pipe at the right also displays the influence of the Carracci, who were masters of caricature.
 Laurent-sur-Mer must have been at one time a drab, cheap resort for vacationing French school teachers. Now, on June 6th, 1944, it was the ugliest beach in the whole world ... I took out my second Contax camera and began to shoot without raising my head. -- Robert CapaUnder heavy fire, photographer Robert Capa swam ashore along with American soldiers on D-Day in World War II, making images of their successful yet deadly attempt to establish a beachhead in France. While troops around him aimed their guns at enemy forces above the beach, Capa aimed his camera at them, capturing the soldiers' bravery and the battle's intensity. Because Capa was standing in the water with them, the camera angle provides a sense of the chaos of war that soldiers surely felt on that day.Although Capa shot 72 images that day, all but eleven were ruined when the negatives were placed in an overheated film drying cabinet in a London lab. The images that survived appear grainy and blurry, partly due to this error, and partly due to Capa's nerves. Despite the damage, the effect appears almost intentional--as a visual metaphor for the confusing experience of combat. As with many of his war photographs, this image exemplifies Capa's oft-quoted philosophy,  If your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough. 
Such an elaborately ornamented cup and saucer was intended for display rather than use. Its heavily decorated surface combined various complicated techniques: jeweling, painted cameos, and painted scenes. The expensive technique known asjeweling,using stamped gold foils set with colored enamels to imitate pearls and precious jewels in red, yellow, orange, and green, was used at the Svres Porcelain Manufactory for only five years, between 1780 and 1785.On the sides of the cup and saucer, slightly domed oval plaques of porcelain have been attached, imitating stone cameos with profiles of classical busts. The painted reserves show scenes from the sacrifice of Cupid. All these decorative elements are set in a deep brown ground color--a novelty at Svres at this date--evocatively namedmerde d'oie,literally  goose droppings. These objects were gilded by tienne-Henri Le Guay and jeweled by Philippe Parpette.
The Svres porcelain manufactory produced numerous plates with a wide variety of decoration, either as matching sets or as part of dinner or dessert services. This example, however, is one of a small number of individually decorated plates intended for display rather than use. The gilding is more finely detailed and the floral reserves more delicately painted than normal. The reddish-brown ground flecked with gold was also experimental and was apparently not used for any other service.Svres may have sold sample plates like this one as collector's items or for presentation to favored clients.
With a long beard and curling locks, a slightly disheveledSaint Jeromelistens open-mouthed in astonishment as an angel overhead sounds its trumpet. Vicente Carducho drew Jerome interrupted in the act of writing, with his faithful friend andattributethe lion by his side.Artists often showed Jerome writing, undoubtedly a common activity for the learned saint who translated theBibleinto Latin. Jerome commonly appeared nearly nude, giving artists the opportunity to display his gaunt, ascetic figure. Carducho suggested the saint's lean, muscular body with brownwashand whitegouache, using while radiating strokes of black chalk to describe the drapery, which nearly merges with the rocks. The artist reworked the saint's right leg several times, positioning it first forward and then further back until it rested underneath his left knee. The black chalksquaringon this drawing implies that Carducho intended this drawing as apreparatory studyfor a large painting, although scholars have not identified such a work.
The Grand Canal is filled with a colorful array of boats getting ready to make their way out to sea. This is Ascension Day, when Venice celebrates her authority over the sea by conducting a symbolic marriage ceremony with the Adriatic Sea. In front of theDoge'spalace, the Doge boards the magnificent two-storied Boat of the State called the Bucintoro, which will head a procession of other boats out to the Porto del Lido. On arrival, the Patriarch of Venice will bless the sea with holy water and the Doge will throw out a ring from a little door in the prow, saying,  In sign of eternal domination, we, the Doge of Venice, marry you, oh sea. Luca Carlevarijs carefully delineated the piazza San Marco, framed by the library, the campanile, thebasilica, and most prominently, the Doge's palace. Carlevarijs founded the tradition ofvedute, or view painting, that flourished in Venice in the 1700s.
A variety of brightly colored boats line the Grand Canal to participate in a regatta or boat race held in honor of the visiting King of Denmark, Frederick IV. In the middle boat, liverymen in red and gold uniforms row the king, dressed in red, toward his waiting hosts at the Palazzo Foscari, seen on the left. They will pass a huge green parade float, decorated with royal, Venetian, and aquatic symbols, that marks the end of the race. At the foot of the float are four different colored flags; whoever grabs the red flag first is the winning boatman.The view towards the Rialto bridge, seen in the far distance, shows in great detail the facades of buildings alongside the canal, with spectators filling the balconies. Luca Carlevarijs painted manyvedute, views of Venice that were popular souvenirs with diplomatic visitors and wealthy foreigners making theGrand Tourof Italy in the 1700s.
Designed to hold sheets of music at an angle, the rectangular music rest can be raised or lowered for a standing or seated musician.The extending arms hold candles to illuminate the sheet music for evening concerts or dances. Around the third decade of the 1700s, French designers and cabinetmakers developed new, highly specific forms of furniture to meet the needs of theirpatrons. Stands such as this one furnishedsalons,music rooms, or smallercabinetswhere guests gathered for conversation or entertainment.
In the early 1760s artisans began to make small round worktables, directed by themarchands-merciers.As they could easily be moved around a room for multiple uses, these items quickly became popular. Theporcelaintop, which could withstand heated vessels without damage, was ideal for serving tea or coffee. Some tables were even sold with porcelain tea services that matched the decoration of the top.Parisianmarchands-mercierswere the first to use Svres porcelain plaques in furniture. Creating a work table such as this one was a complicated process involving many stages. First the dealer commissioned a design and ordered plaques from the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. He then selected anbnisteto make andveneerthe carcass of the table, leaving space for the plaques. A variety of craftsmen designed and made thegiltbronzemounts.

Many new styles of writing desks appeared in the 1700s. Desks such as this delicate model were not designed for serious work; rather, these precious objects ornamented the room while providing their owners with a place to lock up their private letters. The front of this piece opens to reveal a velvet-lined writing surface and several drawers surrounding a pigeonhole.Parisianmarchands-mercierswere the first to use Svresporcelainplaques to decorate furniture.

The central frieze plaque was gilded by Pierre-Andr Le Guay.
The uprightsecrtairebegan to be a fashionable form around the mid-1700s, when letterwriting became a popular pastime. Themarchands-mercierswere quick to respond to this demand, providing many types of small tables or desks with interiors fitted for storing writing tools. The front lowers to form a writing surface, revealing drawers and pigeonholes.Until his death in 1785, Martin Carlin was thebnistemost frequently employed by themarchands-merciersto mount porcelain plaques on furniture; this piece is likely to have been made for one of them. This expensive form of decoration began around 1760 and became extremely fashionable within ten years. In addition to the porcelain plaques, the gilt bronze mounts in the form of drapery swags and the hanging oak branches are also typical of Carlin's work.
Themarchand-mercierDominique Daguerre purchased the porcelain plaques that decorate the sides of this table from the Svres Porcelain Manufactory specifically to be mounted on furniture. Once ordered from Svres, the porcelain plaques, including the unusually-shaped ones at either end of the table, would have been given by the dealer to thebnisteMartin Carlin with orders tomountthem onto a newly designed piece.This table was among the pieces of furniture that Daguerre sold in May 1782 to Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna and Grand Duke Paul Petrovich of Russia, who later became the Czar and Czarina. They made an unofficial trip through Europe traveling as the comte and comtesse du Nord. The Duchess installed the table in her bedroom at the Palace of Pavlosk, near Saint Petersburg.
They put down a stone and throw at it from a distance with balls or pebbles. The one who fails to overturn the stone carries the other, having his eyes blindfolded by the rider, until, if he does not go astray, he reaches the stone, which is called a dioros.-- PolluxChildren inantiquityplayed ephedrismos, the game the ancient Greek writer Pollux describes above and which is pictured on this lekythos. Although this looks like a scene of children at play, the two figures represented here are actually a satyr--identified by his beard and the hint of a tail--and a short-haired woman called a maenad.  Bothsatyrsandmaenadswere followers ofDionysos, the god of wine, vegetation, and the theater. Satyrs and maenads cavorted in a childlike manner, so it is not surprising to see them playing this version of a piggyback game.Lekythoi like this one were tall flasks that held precious oil that was used in funerary rituals. The vessels were then left on the graves or buried with the deceased.
In 1571 a dramatic solar eclipse occurred: this event probably served as the subject of this painting by Antoine Caron. He painted it at the court of Catherine deMedici, queen of France, who, like many rulers of the time, was extremely superstitious and fascinated by astronomical phenomena, often seeing eclipses and natural disasters as foreboding omens.In the painting, astronomers gather in a town square beneath the shadowed sun. A bearded Greek philosopher in theforegroundlooks at the sky and points to an armillary sphere on the ground. Next to him, the central figure,Dionysius the Areopagite, holds a book, points to the sky, and looks at the celestial globe carried by the figure running up the steps at the right. Dionysius preaches the Christian message of salvation to pagan Greek philosophers. Aputto, seated on the steps between a square and straight edge, writes on a tablet, recording the event.In thebackgroundon the right, a statue representingUrania, themuseof Astronomy, stands on a twisted column. Near the statue, figures run and point towards the heavens while seeking cover. Above, an ominous red sun glows and lightning streaks the stormy, cloud-filled sky.
The imposing figure of abishopholding a long taper stick and climbing the stairs fills this slightly irregularly shaped drawing. As he mounts the stairs, the bishop turns to gaze sadly out at the viewer.After delicately drawing in the man's form with pen and brownwash, Vittore Carpaccio went over his long cape, beard, and pointed hat with fine lines of whitebodycolor, giving a sense of shimmering texture to the drapery's deep folds. He made this drawing as apreparatory studyfor part of a painting, completed in 1493.Theverso, by contrast, is a fragmentary study related to a much later picture. This horizontal image shows the legs of a seated figure that have been delicately draped with cloth. Here Carpaccio used the white bodycolor not only to createhighlightsin the fabric but also to suggest the form and position of the legs as they lift and shape their flimsy covering.
Gazing downwards, God the Father grasps his celestial orb in one hand and watches over earth surrounded by a ring of clouds. Vittore Carpaccio first applied black chalk and gray wash, describing the figure's overall outline with strong strokes. Dark vertical lines of hatching give texture to God's robe as well as to the clouds. The artist then exploited the brilliance and luminosity of the white gouache by applying it on top of the chalk. With white lines, he delineated the long delicate hairs of God's beard, differentiating them from the curling strands on his head. The glowing quality of the white gouache and the solid three-dimensionality of God's form create a sense of energy radiating from him.When the sheet is turned upside down, another study in red chalk appears beneath the greenish-blue preparation. This shows the upper part of the torso of a standing man wearing a toga-like costume and raising his left forearm. This abandoned sketch may have been drawn in connection with the study on the verso. The young man on the verso--probably Christ--who appears to be on a pedestal, may have been copied from an antique sculpture.
The hinges and latch on this two-sided panel suggest that it was used as a decorative window shutter or a door to cabinet. The front depicts a scene of Venetian bird hunters, and the reverse shows atrompe-l'oeil(deceive the eye). Contemporary viewers looking at the front of the panel had the illusion of looking into the lagoon, as is evident in this reconstruction of how the panel once appeared.Groups of three rowers and archers stand in shallow-bottomed boats and hunt cormorants, glossy black water birds. The archers use clay pellets rather than arrows in order to stun the birds and not damage their plumage. A pellet, seen in mid-air, has just been fired by an archer in the boat in the lower right-hand corner and is about to strike the bird in theforeground.The lily blossom at the bottom left of the painting is out of scale with the rest of the image. Recent examination indicated that the hunting scene served as thebackgroundfor a scene of two women sitting on a balcony overlooking the lagoon, a panel that is now in the Correr Museum in Venice. That painting has an empty stem in a vase sitting on abalustradethat matches up with the blossom in the Getty Museum's painting. The identical wood grain of the two panels confirmed that they were once a single panel. The two parts were probably sawed apart before the nineteenth century.
In this simple study of theVirgin Marykneeling in prayer, Vittore Carpaccio concentrated on the simple lines of her headdress and the crisp folds of her robe. With a brush and apainterlyapproach, he applied a rich brownwashto her form, with dark lines outlining the body and parallel hatching to give texture. Carpaccio then added strokes of whitebodycolorto create brilliant effects of light hitting the surface of the fabric. He produced the drawing as apreparatory studyfor a painting.Theversocontains a variety of sketches that Carpaccio probably produced ten to fifteen years later. In the main image, the Virgin gazes down in prayer, with her disembodied clasped hands placed directly below her. Another study of a hand holding a quill pen projects from the lower left edge.
In this highly unusualbust, painter Jean-Leon Grme looks out from beneath tousled hair through weary yet visionary eyes, his head looming large above his abbreviated chest. Unlike most busts, this one abruptly terminates in an irregular, jagged edge precariously set atop a conventional socle, like a fragment of ancient sculpture that has survived the ravages of time. This disembodiment symbolizes the struggling and alienated creative spirit that theRomanticssaw in artists, musicians, and poets.Grme, a successfulacademicartist and one of EmperorNapoleon'sfavored painters, taught at thecole des Beaux-Artsfor over forty years. Sculptor Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux made the first version of this bust of his friend in clay when he and Grme were both exiled in London during the Paris Commune of 1871. Carpeaux sent a bronze version to the 1872Salonand produced many other versions of the bust in terrracotta, plaster, and bronze.
Known in her younger days as the  sirenwith green eyes,  Madame Nadine Dumas retains her grace and charm in this portraitbustof her at a mature age. Carved in white marble, she is a handsome woman in her later years with a forceful presence. As she turns with a steady gaze, her upright pose conveys self-assurance. Her unconventional expression suggests intelligence and strength as it shows her with a furrowed brow, caught in a moment of thought. The lace edging on her blouse and the waves in her upswept hair add animation to the smooth surface, while the termination of the bust is softened with a shawl loosely knotted around the shoulders and waist.The daughter of a lawyer from the Baltic region, Nadine, born Nadeja Knorring, married Prince Alexandre Naryschkine, her elder by twenty years. After separating from her husband, she lived with the famous author Alexandre Dumasfilsfor about twelve years, unable to marry him until 1864, when Prince Naryschkine died. Artist Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, a close friend of Dumas and a witness at his wedding to Nadeja, conceived of the bust as a friendship portrait. He carved it while staying with the Dumas couple in the north of France near Dieppe.
On the interior of this Athenian red-figure kylix or cup, a seated youth pulls his older male lover down toward him for a kiss. In Athenian aristocratic circles in the Archaic period, older men often courted youths. Such homosexual relationships were viewed as a key element in the socialization of youths, involving strong elements of mentoring as well as eroticism.The exterior of the cup depicts youths and bearded men training in various athletic activities, including the javelin, discus, and long jump. The youth in the long robe playing the flutes provides music for the training. Greek vases of the Archaic period frequently depict favorite pursuits of the aristocratic patrons who used the vessels; scenes of athletic training, another key element in the socialization of Athenian youths, are among the most common.
In these studies of various men, Annibale or Lodovico Carracci observed his companions with great liveliness and force. Paper was extremely valuable, so Carracci used a sheet that already contained a copy after a figure group--the man holding a lamb drawn sideways from the left center. The two profile views of the bearded man wearing a hat, one at the top left and one along the center left edge, were probably his next additions. Gazing squarely at the viewer, the young man with his head cupped in his hands at the upper right overlaps the earlier profiles. At the bottom, drawing from the side, Carracci squeezed in a youth whose hat covers his sketchy eyes.When the Getty Museum purchased this drawing in 1985, the conservator lifted the sheet from its mount and discovered additional studies on the verso: at the bottom another man with a hat (possibly the same man as on the recto), at the top an upside-down young boy resting on his arms, and at the right an unfinished red chalk study of a head sideways.
Although Saint Sebastian is usually depicted bound to a tree or pillar and pierced by arrows, that attempt by the Romans to take his life was unsuccessful. Ludovico Carracci chose to represent the moment after the subsequent deadly beating, when Roman soldiers dumped Sebastian's limp and lifeless body into a sewer.Against the dark of night, brutish soldiers lift and tug the dead saint's body. Ludovico contrasted the tensile strength of their straining bodies with the slackness of the saint's limbs, head, and facial muscles as he falls into the sewer's depths. The night atmosphere is dark and thick: figures seem to emerge from the blackness. Light glints dully off helmets and armor, but the soldiers' faces are unreadable. A bright light suffuses the body of Saint Sebastian, making him the focal point of the composition.In 1612 Cardinal Maffeo Barberini commissioned this painting from Ludovico for his family's chapel in the Church of San Andrea della Valle in Rome. The chapel commemorated the site where Saint Sebastian's body was recovered from the sewer, called the Cloaca Maxima. Barberini decided to keep the painting in his private collection, believing that an image of the recovery of Sebastian's body by Christians was more appropriate for the church.
The use of chalk on blue paper was a common practice of Venetian artists and one that Agostino Carracci used frequently, in order to create mass through broad modeling. In the figure on therecto, Carracci used white chalk to pick up highlights on the man's back and curly locks of hair.Carracci based this drawing on a painting by Veronese that he saw on a trip to Venice and Padua in 1582. During this sojourn, Carracci carefully studied the works of the Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese and made numerous engravings after their paintings.
In the early 1590s, Agostino Carracci, his brother Annibale, and their cousin Ludovico decorated a number of rooms in Bologna's Palazzo Magnani; many of their works are still in place. Agostino Carracci made this drawing as a study for thefrescoover a fireplace. The story of Cupid's conquest of the Greek god Pan demonstrated the triumph of love over lust and illustrated Virgil's dictum,  Omnia vincit Amor  (Love conquers all).Carracci made the study on theversofor the head of the priest in his painting of theLast Communion of Saint Jeromeof about 1589. The soft modeling, the extreme foreshortening of Cupid's head, and the use of chalk on blue prepared paper show his interest in Venetian art.
Shepherds and children paying homage to the Christ Child make up the central group of figures in this drawing. The shepherd on the left points in the direction of the Holy Family, not depicted on this sheet. He faces another shepherd, who gestures to a lamb with bound feet in the foreground. The lamb is a gift to Christ and may symbolize his future sacrifice. Other offerings include a basket of eggs and small birds held by children: humble yet symbolic counterparts to the opulent gifts brought by the three kings.The upper right corner of the composition shows three unknown bearded men in profile, probably a study for a medal. Below and near the right margin is the head of a man with a wispy beard who may be the same person as the man shown on the left of the medal. Agostino Caracci's design for theAdoration of the Shepherdswas used in a painting by his brother, Annibale Carracci. The painting is now lost, but a copy by Domenichino, Annibale's pupil, is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh.
A nude triton displays his rippling, muscular figure as he turns to blow a conch shell announcing a special event. His powerful sculptural form and sense of monumentality derive from ancient Roman sculpture and Renaissance art, especially Michelangelo's Sistine Chapelignudi, while the use of black and white chalks on blue-gray paper reflects Agostino Carracci's interest in Venetian art of the 1500s.Agostino Carracci made this drawing as a study for a triton in his fresco,Thetis Borne to the Wedding Chamber of Peleus, also known asGalatea. The Carracci brothers began work on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese in Rome, including this fresco, in 1597. For centuries, this cycle of paintings influenced artists as much as Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling.Beginning with drawing from life and understanding anatomy, the Carracci focused on painting the human figure. Their drawings of the nude maintained monumental proportions while broadly sketching the body's essential structure; combining robust energy with soft, rhythmic contours.The fragment of an arm on the verso of this drawing was trimmed from a study of a triton now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proving that this sheet was once part of a larger one.
The sad, staring eyes, prominent ears that sit a bit far back on the head, tousled hair, and the long flat nose identify this as Annibale Carracci. He assumed an informal pose, leaning slightly forward with his right elbow extending slightly beyond the frame's bottom and casting a shadow. As he drew himself in the mirror, his right hand was moving, resulting in the tangle of lines representing the left arm. Skeletal beasts with beaked heads and long necks peer down from the upper corners, reminders of mortality, and two beady-eyed dolphins with tails in the air inhabit the bottom corners.Carracci humorously portrayed himself here as a scruffy, ordinary individual. In a format usually reserved for formal, flattering portraits, he demonstrated his ability to quickly pick out the most important, expressive features. In a display of originality, he leans forward out of the picture frame as if from a window.Francesco Maria Niccol Gabburri, who assembled numerous drawn self-portraits and portraits of artists, once owned this sheet. He also owned the Getty Museum'sSelf-portraitby Gaetano Sabatini, which shares the oval format. This drawing remains laid down on the original Gabburri mount, but it has been cut down drastically.
In these studies of various men, Annibale or Lodovico Carracci observed his companions with great liveliness and force. Paper was extremely valuable, so Carracci used a sheet that already contained a copy after a figure group--the man holding a lamb drawn sideways from the left center. The two profile views of the bearded man wearing a hat, one at the top left and one along the center left edge, were probably his next additions. Gazing squarely at the viewer, the young man with his head cupped in his hands at the upper right overlaps the earlier profiles. At the bottom, drawing from the side, Carracci squeezed in a youth whose hat covers his sketchy eyes.When the Getty Museum purchased this drawing in 1985, the conservator lifted the sheet from its mount and discovered additional studies on the verso: at the bottom another man with a hat (possibly the same man as on the recto), at the top an upside-down young boy resting on his arms, and at the right an unfinished red chalk study of a head sideways.
Two cousins share in a moment of mutual happiness in this scene of rejoicing. TheVirgin Maryrushes up the steps to congratulate her elderly cousinSaint Elizabeth, placing her left hand on Elizabeth's shoulder and clasping the other. Both women celebrate their respective pregnancies, the Virgin with the infantJesusand Elizabeth with John the Baptist. Elizabeth had particular cause for celebration as she had conceived in old age, after a lifetime of barrenness.Juan Carreo de Miranda conveyed the scene thorough energetic motion and nervous handling of the pen. Vigorous strokes describe the flowing outline of the Virgin's cloak, while summary passages ofwashin gray-brown define Elizabeth's head and back. Amid the swirlingmassof lines on the left several indistinct heads are visible. Another mother crouches at the foot of the steps, holding a baby in her arms.
Kneeling on a rock with his head bowed, Christ pushes his hands forcefully against his chest in a sign of humility--an emotional display played up by Juan Carreo de Miranda's bold drawing style. Carreo made this preparatory drawing for his paintingThe Baptism of Christ, which shows John the Baptist anointing Jesus in the desert as God watches from above.To add solidity to the chest and limbs, Carreo used stumping, a technique of blending charcoal and chalk with a soft, stick like object. Thick, charcoal-black lines delineate rippling muscles and slightly enlarged limbs. White-chalk highlights create the illusion that parts of the body project forward in space, adding a sense of three-dimensionality. Red chalk on Christ's hands and feet creates further naturalistic details by suggesting flesh tones.Although Carreo's rough drawing style is distinctly Spanish, the combination of charcoal and red and white chalk reflects the strong influence of Renaissance Venetian art on seventeenth-century Spanish artists. Carreo studied the works of Titian, and often collaborated with other Spanish artists captivated by the Italian style, such as fellow court painter Francisco Rizi.
Leaning casually on a pillar with disheveled hair signifying his creative genius, author Alexandre Dumaspreturns, his focused expression adding dramatic intensity to the informality of his pose. In his left hand he secures sheets of hismanuscripton the pillar, which is inscribed with the titles of his most famous works. Author ofThe Three Musketeersand theCount of Monte Cristo,Dumas was one of the most prolific and popular French authors in the 1800s. Sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse fashioned thisterracottaas a model for the large bronze monument to his close friend that was erected in Dumas's hometown of Villers-Cotteret in 1884. Using simple broad monumental forms for the body, he expressed Dumas's artistic power as an almost physical force. In contrast to the large planes of the coat and limbs, the sculptor crisply defined the facial features and hair with a sharp tool. Since Dumas had died over thirteen years earlier, Carrier-Belleuse derived the facial features from an earlier marble portraitbust, made by another artist and exhibited in 1876.
This alluring muse gracefully turns her head to the left, exposing a seductive neck and tender pink earlobe. Transparent gauze covers her shoulders. Rosalba Carriera rendered the porcelain skin, flushed cheeks, and wavy hair with subtly blended pastel colors, creating a soft, velvety surface. The intense contrast between the ivory flesh and dark background imbues the divine creature with radiance. This delicate head crowned by soft curls and an ivy wreath was one of many idealized images Carriera made calledteste di fantasia--a kind of fanciful rendering of a beautiful woman with a mythological or allegorical appearance. Celebrated throughout Europe for her mastery of pastel, Carriera likely created this image for Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland.
Rosalba Carriera played a key role in transforming pastel painting from an amateur pastime into a serious artistic pursuit. Most of her sitters were young tourists, impatient to get back to the manifold sensual pleasures readily available in Venice.By contrast, Sir James Gray, second Baronet (about 1708-1773) was a successful British diplomat and antiquarian living in the city. Carriera thus had the opportunity to get to know him well and study his countenance over repeated sittings, resulting in a penetrating characterization virtually unmatched in her oeuvre. Her meticulous attention to detail is evident in passages such as the strands of chestnut hair emerging from underneath Sir James's powdered wig.
The unusual feature of donkey's ears provides the clue to the identity of this disembodied head of an older man, with closed eyes and tilted to the side. He represents the mythological King Midas, a figure of legendary foolishness best known for a magical touch that turned all objects to gold. According toOvid'sMetamorphoses,Apollopunished Midas by giving him the ears of a donkey after he chose Pan rather than Apollo in a musical contest.Jean-Joseph Carris left the head oddly truncated, resting not on a torso nor even on a neck but rather on amassof roughly handled plaster. This amorphous truncation expresses the inner spirit divorced from bodily form. As a self-portrait, the image forms anallegoryof Carris's life. Perceiving himself as foolish, bestial, and uncultured, he presented a thoroughly modern, powerfully intimate, yet ultimately debased representation.Carris formed this head, one of his most celebrated works, with plaster in a many-pieced mold. He then shellacked it to give it apatinaresembling metal. He also made other versions in plaster, wax, clay, and bronze.
LikeAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandand his other books, Carroll's photographs are fantasies starring the children of his friends. In this production, the Kitchin siblings enacted the romantic legend of Saint George, the patron saint of England, who slayed a child-eating dragon before it devoured a princess. George later married the rescued princess and converted her pagan town to Christianity. Using crude stagecraft to reference key plot points, Carroll condensed the entire legend into a single scene in which the princess appears as both damsel in distress and bride.
These decorative vases would have sat on the mantelpiece to be admired rather than used. Elaborately decorated withgilding, pearl-like beads, and a delicate pinkpointill(dotted) ground, these vases are fine pieces of Svres porcelain, made at the height of the factory's popularity in the 1770s and 1780s.Copying paintings by the French artist Joseph Vernet, the porcelain painter Vincent Taillandier painted the maritime scenes in the reserves on the front and back.
Taking the subject from theGospelof Luke, Valerio Castello captured the dramatic scene in whichChristprays earnestly before hisCrucifixion, on a knoll above the apostles sleeping below. The artist relied on line to create gradations of light and shadow and to model the figures' forms, unifying the drawing with a wide range of hatching and cross-hatching. Light diagonal lines create the dark clouds on the left and the folds in the apostles' robes, while delicate strokes ofbodycolorcreate luminous patterns ofhighlights.Scholars have been unable to identify any painting whosecompositioncorresponds to this drawing. Judging from its high degree of finish and small scale, it was more likely made as a design for an etching or engraving.
In making this drawing, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione may have originally intended to illustrate a Biblical scene, such as the flight of Mary and Joseph to Egypt. Instead he produced an entirely new type of pastoral subject: a young mother seated on the ground nursing her children. She is noticeably at home amidst the animals and the surrounding landscape. A classically posed male figure, presumably the father, casually leans on his horse, looking toward his family. The lazy-looking dog to the left of the composition is a stock figure that appears in some of the artist's other drawings. Castiglione conceived of this unusually large drawing as an independent work of art, and employed his characteristic, vigorous brushstrokes to convey a sense of vitality.
Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione captured the dramatic consequence of Isaac's birth in the Old Testament. After Sarah, the aged wife of hundred-year-old Abraham, miraculously gave birth to Isaac, she forced her husband to cast out her servant Hagar and Ishmael, the son Hagar had already borne Abraham.Castiglione's friezelike composition, with figures balanced carefully along the foreground plane in front of a classical architectural backdrop, reflects the influence of fellow Baroque artist Nicolas Poussin, whose circle Castiglione frequented in Rome.Oil sketches emerged in the 1500s as a step in the preparation of a painting, but Castiglione was among the earliest artists to make them as independent, finished works of art. Castiglione  drew  with the brush in oils, using little color and thus conveying the effect of a drawing rather than a painting. He used white sparingly to highlight; most of the composition is sketched in thick, textural strokes of red-brown oil paint, enhancing the image's tone of dark, brooding emotion. Flatly painted areas of blue set off the figures from the background.
As a young woman rides her horse through a flock of sheep, she turns to speak to a man walking by her side. The sheep bunch tightly together, guided by three young shepherds, and a man carrying a large pitcher stands beneath a palm tree in thebackground. This scene probably shows the biblical figures ofAbrahamand his wifeSarahjourneying to Egypt to escape the famine.Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione used oil paint to create this detailed drawing. With the tip of the brush, he varied the shape and curve of his strokes to create the woolly sheep coats, the fluttering leaves in the tree overhead, and the softly faded tones of the landscape in the background.
TwoArcadianshepherds with coarse features discover a tomb inscribed with the wordsTemporalis Aeternitas,alluding to the brevity or frailty of human life. The subject, one that Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione had borrowed from Poussin a decade earlier, was meant to remind viewers that time brings oblivion even to the highest achievements of humankind. An assortment of objects lying on the ground at the left--statues, musical instruments, a seashell, books, and armor--symbolize human accomplishments that have begun to crumble into ruin.Set against a blue sky with purplish-gray clouds, Castiglione evoked the mystery of an ancient lost civilization. Colors are rich and powerful, with bright reds and blues and a strong red-brown ground.
Saint Jerome sits at a small pedestal desk within a niche, apparently writing in a book that he supports with his left hand. Casting a deep shadow over the right side of Jerome's body and the back of the niche, the hatching hints at the depth of the shallow space. Although by the mid-1600s this depiction was considered a little old-fashioned, artists in the Renaissance frequently showed the intellectual saint at work in his study.Juan del Castillo changed his mind about the composition in several minor areas. He altered the saint's cap to a cardinal's hat and reduced the drapery in the lower left, part of which originally fell outside the edge of the niche, so that it would fit within the design. Although he probably intended the design for a wall decoration, it also could have been used for a painting in an arched frame.Castillo may have drawn the figure study on the back swiftly from life or used a flayed cadaver to capture the lifeless droop of the man's body.
This figure, labeledAmititia(Amicitia) in the lower left, represents Friendship. Juan del Castillo took the elements of the allegory from Cesare Ripa'sIconologiaof the 1600s, which became a standard reference work for artists searching for ways to represent abstract ideas. According to Ripa,Amicitiawas to be shown as a fair young woman, simply draped in the white robe of Truth, the virtue upon which friendship is based. She goes barefoot  for friendship knows no inconvenience too great for it,  and rests one foot on a skull,  for friendship jeers at death.  The artist probably intended the sphere drawn here as a free allusion to the skull. The inscription cerca (close) and lexos (far) on her breast refers to Ripa's description of keeping friends close to one's heart, regardless of whether they are near or far.Castillo drew a study for a scene ofChrist on the Crosson the back of this drawing. Since Castillo drew the cross at an oblique angle, the figure may have been made for aRaising of the Cross.
Living in the wilderness as a hermit,Saint Jeromeheard trumpets sounding the Last Judgment; looking up, he saw the cross with Christ's body rising in front of him. Here the trumpet appears so tantalizingly close that Jerome reaches up to try to touch it. His attributes, a lion and a book, surround him.Antonio del Castillo y Saavedra built the dynamiccompositionfrom lively, quick strokes. Hatching and cross-hatching emphasize the rippling muscles on the saint's arms and back and elaborate the folds of fabric around his waist. They suggest the undergrowth on the left and the lion's fur.
These four heads display a range of facial expressions and positions. The dignified gaze of the head at upper left contrasts with the more introverted, downward look of its counterpart on the upper right. The profile at the lower left acts as a foil to the opposite face emitting an agonized cry. Antonio del Castillo y Saavedra varied the way each scarf was tied about the hair to reflect the wearer's range of emotion. The sheet may have come from a book of instructional models for drawing. For centuries, European artists had created such modelbooks as patterns to be copied by apprentices and workshop assistants.His contemporaries admired and remarked on Saavedra's unusual technique of drawing with a reed pen, which he used to create strokes of varying thickness. Another Spanish painter and writer observed that the artist  looked for some ditch reeds or thin shafts that have long tubes, cutting them into thick pens. 
Beginning in 1778, the Svres Porcelain Manufactory produced garnitures of five vases to a design called thevases des ges(vases of the ages). These ornamental vases were made in three sizes: a large central vase with handles in the shape of bearded male heads, a pair of smaller vases with heads of young women, and a pair of still smaller vases with heads of boys. In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles. The scenes painted on the fronts of these vases showed episodes fromThe Adventures of Telemachus,one of the king's favorite books. The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Svres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the rpareur, tienne-Henry Bono. The design was created after engravings by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard and after designs by Charles Monnet. tienne-Henri Le Guay gilded the vases.
These stools were part of an order of sixty-four for the French queen Marie-Antoinette'ssalles de jeux(gaming rooms) at the palaces ofFontainebleauand Compigne. Originally covered with painted satin, they were delivered with twelve matching fixed-leg stools (tabourets), a folding screen, and a fire-screen. Their carved decoration consists of typicalNeoclassicalmotifs: oak wreaths, scrolling ribbons, beading, and rosettes.The wooden X-frame base, a traditional design that originated inclassical antiquity, allowed each stool to fold easily once its cushion was removed. Thus they could be easily transported from room to room.
A grinning centaur, a mythological creature that is half-man and half-horse, stands proudly in this sculpture. He carries a set of panpipes and an animal skin is draped over his left arm. Colored marble such as this was quite expensive and a popular symbol of wealth in the Roman world. It was used primarily for architectural decoration and occasionally for sculpture.This sculpture, acquired by the Getty Museum as a Roman work and believed to have come from the ruins of the palace of the emperorDomitian, has been recently reexamined. These studies suggest that the sculpture was in fact made in the 1700s as a copy of a Roman statue. The centaur is covered with pointing marks that are not ancient.The Getty Museum centaur is remarkably similar to another centaur carved by the eighteenth-century sculptor Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, who offered copies of Romancentaursin his sales catalogue. The Getty centaur may also be the work of Cavaceppi.
Caracalla, one of the bold and brutal Roman emperors who ruled in the early 200s A.D., murdered his brother in his ascent to power and later was himself assassinated. In this marblebust, he wears a soldier's cuirass and toga. Turning his head to the left, he focuses on something that apparently does not meet with his approval. He flares his nostrils and furrows his brow, movements perhaps intended to suggest his ferociousness.In the 1700s, Caracalla's likeness was known from a bust in the Farnese collection in Rome and then Naples, believed to date from the 200s. Sculptor Bartolomeo Cavaceppi drew on this famous prototype for his marble bust of Caracalla. Carved during a period in which collectors bought sculpturesall' antica, this bust was probably intended for an English collector'sNeoclassicalgallery.Cavaceppi was best known for his restorations ofantiquesculpture rather than for his rare original works, such as this one. He demonstrated his familiarity withclassicismthrough his skillful drillwork in the antique manner, seen in the handling of Caracalla's beard and hair. This bust is one of Cavaceppi's rare signed works.
Dressed in full royal attire, a brightlyilluminatedKing Saulpoints to his chest. He wears a shiny breastplate, a cloak of vibrant red, and a crown upon his head. Saul kneels before the ghost ofSamuel, the last Judge of the Israelites. Silhouetted against the bright light that emanates from the doorway, Samuel's skin is ashen and gray. He leans towards Saul with an intense and penetrating gaze indicating troubled concern. Between the two figures, the Witch of Endor also leans forward to look fearfully at the kneeling king.Bernardo Cavallino depicted an episode from theBiblewhen King Saul, about to enter into battle with the Philistines, asked the Witch of Endor to summon the ghost of Samuel, who had recently died. In an irritable mood at having been summoned, Samuel told Saul that the next day the Philistines would defeat Israel and that Saul and his sons would die in battle. Cavallino was able to convey eloquently the emotional interaction among the three figures as Samuel relayed this news.Cavallino applied the paint with rapid, sketchy strokes, allowing the hammered copper's warm tones to glow through the thinly brushed paint in sections of the drapery andbackground.
As the innkeeper looks on, the resurrected Christ reveals himself to his apostles Cleophas and Saint Peter, as described in the gospel of Luke:  When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.  The artist heightens the scene's tension by positioning the table at the very front of the picture plane, hemming in the substantial figures.It is thought that Bartolomeo Cavarozzi painted this painting, which is after Caravaggio's innovative treatment of the subject, now in the National Gallery, London. During the 1600s, Caravaggio's original was in Rome, where it was seen and copied by many artists. The Getty Museum's picture follows the original closely, but with several important differences. The positioning of the three figures surrounding Christ has been reversed. These figures are also shown from a slightly lower viewpoint than Caravaggio's, making them more monumental. This painting has less spatial depth and a more symmetrical composition than Caravaggio's original. The artist also enlarged and lavished great attention on the still life capturing the play of light across a range of textures and surfaces.
Though I called themsatyrs, they showed nothing of the satyr except little horns and a goatish head; all the rest of their form was human.--The Autobiography of Benvenuto CelliniSatyrs fromantiquityinspired Benvenuto Cellini, but his comment makes clear that he consciously discarded the characteristic pointed ears and lower body of a goat. Instead, he limited the figure's goat-like features to the face, which displays protruding horns and a savage, animal-like expression that Cellini described as  fiery and menacing, instilling fear into the beholders.  Cellini designed this and a similar figure to flank the monumental entrance of Porte Dore, the royal palace atFontainebleau. Turning his head sharply to his left, the bearded and horned satyr gazes fiercely--with a dramatically furrowed brow; deeply chiseled eyes; full, gnarled lips; and an open-mouthed scowl--toward an unknown intruder. Cellini posed the figure with the right arm raised to support a cornice. In the left hand, a short stump suggests the thick club the figure was designed to lean on, which was evidently broken before the model was cast.  The French KingFranois Icommissioned Cellini to execute the designs for Porte Dore in the early 1540s; however, after being accused of theft in 1545 Cellini was forced to leave France. Consequently, the project was never completed. Scholars believe that in his haste, Cellini left the wax models for his design behind, and they were later cast by an unknown artist.
In the central panel of this opulent polyptych, Christ crowns his mother, the Virgin Mary, as gathered angels and saints look on. The altarpiece decorated a chapel dedicated to Saint Benedict in the Church of Santa Trinit, Florence, which explains why Saint Benedict is portrayed twice, on the left panel and again in a scene below.The altarpiece's various panels do not depict episodes in chronological order. In the pinnacles above the central scene, which were added at a later date, the Archangel Gabriel announces the conception of Christ to the Virgin. Below, in the predella, or lowest panel, the Virgin's death is represented at the center. To either side are scenes of saints triumphing over evil. On the far left, Saint Benedict exorcises a devil, and in the panel to the right Saint John baptizes Christ. To the right of the Virgin's death, devils torment Saint Anthony, while on the far right Saint Lawrence liberates a soul from purgatory.Cenni di Francesco di Ser Cenni used lavish amounts of gold leaf and different types of punch marks and tooling to describe haloes and background decorations. He took great pains to include details such as attributes for saints on the side wings and landscapes in most of the predella panels. The opulence and sheer elaborateness of this altarpiece inspired awe in Christian viewers of the late 1300s and remain impressive today.
A Franciscanmonk, possiblySaint Francishimself, turns his eyes towards heaven in supplication, his gaunt face shown in profile. The monk's features--with his large eyes, finely modeled nose, and slightly parted lips--are carefully observed and delicately drawn. Cerano used swift, curving strokes to capture the short curls at the back of the monk's tonsured head and softer, smudged lines for the wispy strands on his chin and upper lip. The artist created dramatic contrasts by using strongchiaroscurolighting effects: a dark shadow behind the man's head sets off his thin face and the hollows of his cheeks.Although similar figures appear in several paintings by Cerano, scholars have not yet identified the specific painting for which this drawing was apreparatory study.
This narrative relief illustrates a scene from a popular thirteenth-century text that emphasized the humanity of Christ and the Virgin Mary. With the Christ child on her lap, Mary is approached by young Saint John the Baptist and his mother, the Virgin's cousin Saint Elizabeth. The elderly Elizabeth helps her son along as he walks toward Jesus to offer him a globe, a sign of Christ's role as savior of the world. Two small boys, possibly angels, accompany the group. At the center of the relief, a prominently placed tree likely signifies the Tree of Life.The relief may have formed part of a larger sculptural complex, although it would also have been appropriate for an altar. Because of the rarity of its subject and its extraordinarily high quality, it is also possible that the relief stood on its own as a devotional image in a private chapel.
Cesare da Sesto's sensitive line and refined shading create a delicate, elegant effect in which his figures seem to be laid ever so gently onto the page. He made his initial sketch in red chalk, going over the final design in pen and ink, adding contours and shading.Known for his lifelong synthesis of Raphael's and Leonardo da Vinci's art, Cesare followed their examples here. The lively gestures and poses of the male figures-especially the one at right-reflect Leonardo's influence, while theSaint George and the Dragonon the verso resembles Raphael's painting of the subject now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.This sheet once may have been part of a sketchbook, now-dismembered in the Pierpont Morgan Library. The Morgan sketchbook pages are the same size as this sheet, and they show similar figures and groups inspired by Leonardo and Raphael, drawn with the same graceful style.
The Virgin, the infants, and an unidentified figure form a pyramid, flanked byJosephand set against the simple, vertical columns. In his mature style, Bartolomeo Cesi characteristically combined suchnaturalisticfigures with a sober mood and an abstract, geometricalcomposition. Cesi derived the naturalism of the figures, particularly the infants, from his practice of drawing from life, which the Carracci Academy introduced in Bologna.Reflecting the ideas of the Counter-Reformation, which zealously advocated against  immorality  in art, Cesi exhibited a rather severe style. He never made his surfaces gleam or embellished them in any way. The Carthusians, Roman Catholicism's most ascetic order, may have influenced Cesi's approach.
When a jury member at the ParisSalonof 1866 first saw Paul Czanne's portrait of the journalist and critic Antony Valabrgue, he exclaimed that the portrait was not painted with a knife but with a pistol. Although the Salon refused him admission, Czanne continued to paint many portraits of his friend, including the present example, thought to have been painted around 1869 to 1871.For this painting, Czanne used a palette knife rather than brushes. With the spatula-like instrument, he applied paint in thick, successive layers, giving the surface a complex, rough-and-smooth texture. He then used the knife to squeeze the paints together so that they mixed directly on the canvas. In this fashion Czanne moved the paint around, eliminating contour lines and instead creating impastoed areas of color, as if sculpting in paint. In another portrait of his friend made four years earlier, the coarse, almost violent appearance created by Czanne's technique led Valabrgue to complain in a letter to the writer Zola:  He has given me such a fierce complexion that it reminds me of the statue of Champfleury when it was stained with squashed blackberries. 
The nude played a central role in Paul Czanne's art throughout his career, but, paradoxically for an artist who usually drew from life, he seldom used nude models in his working process: he was said to be ill-at-ease with naked sitters.  I paint still lifes,  he once told Renoir,  Women models frighten me.  Cezanne contented instead with studying earlier artists and using the drawings after nude models that he had made in art school in Paris.The meaning of this enigmatic painting is unclear, and it has been known by several titles. This woman is confronted by devotees from different arts and occupations, among them a miteredbishop, whose admiration seems intrusive, even aggressive. A painter sometimes identified as Eugne Delacroix stands at his easel painting the scene. The bald figure at the painting's bottom may be Czanne himself. Whether she encourages their adoration, passively accepts it, or is trapped by her cult is unclear. Like many of Czanne's nudes, the woman's face is nearly blank, except for her red eye sockets. Around 1877 Czanne began to use the parallel diagonal strokes seen here to impose order and to unify his picture's surface.
During the last thirty years of his life, Paul Czanne painted the same objects--the green vase, the rum bottle, the ginger pot, and the apples--over and over again. His interest was not in the objects themselves but in using them to experiment with shape, color, and lighting. He arranged his still lifes so that everything locked together. Edges of objects run into each other; for example, a black arabesque seemingly escapes from the blue cloth to capture an apple in the center; the sinuous curves of the blue ginger pot's rattan straps merge with other straps on the body of the bottle behind. Giving form and mass to objects through the juxtaposition of brushstrokes and carefully balanced colors and textures, he gave the painting a sense of comforting stability.
Leaning on a fabric-covered table and resting her head in her hand, this young woman looks out with an enigmatic expression. Since theRenaissance, artists have used this pose to portray melancholy. The pose, combined with her hauntingly unreadable face, gives a human poignancy and psychological tension to the figure.Juxtaposing bold, individual strokes of color, Paul Czanne built up the woman's powerful physical presence and the space she occupies. As a twentieth-century painter and admirer of Czanne observed, his later works, such asYoung Italian Womanhave  an enormous sense of volume, breathing, pulsating, expanding, contracting, through his use of colors.  While the woman's form is convincing, the space behind and around her can appear contradictory and even confusing. How far away is the wall  Is the tabletop flat underneath the cloth  Does she sit or stand  These questions give tension and movement to an otherwise stablecomposition.From the 1890s until the end of his life, Czanne painted a number of these grand figure studies, usually relying upon local workers or residents for his models.
The still life was a principal theme throughout Paul Czanne's artistic career. Using a repertoire of everyday objects such as fruit, jugs, bottles, and plates, he experimented with relationships of form, color, and pattern. Although the groupings seem casual, Czanne is known to have taken great care with the arrangement, sometimes spending hours positioning the objects.In this brightly colored watercolor, Czanne's monumental conception of form is evident: the jug, the two pots, one white, one blue, and the seven apples assume a physical presence beyond normal perception of their existence. Using small patches of color laid next to one another, Czanne evoked the plasticity of substance, building form rather like bricks build structures. His fresh and vigorous brushstrokes are visible against the background wall as areas of greens and blues are juxtaposed. The apples are described with red arcs around the perimeter, then yellow brushstrokes next to the red; the empty middle suggests light reflecting off the surface. Curving brushstrokes of brown, green, and blue that seem to blend with the bottom half of the wall actually compose the tablecloth.
The Flandrin brothers, Paul and Hippolyte, were well-known French academic painters, so closely identified with one another that fellow artists often addressed them as though they were one person. They often created double self-portraits, with the commercial photographer Chabrol acting as camera operator, but not creative director. So similar in countenance that they could be twins, they form near mirror reflections of one another, their individuality betrayed only by the subtle difference in costuming and the turn of a head. The informal backdrop suggests that this work may have been made in the brothers' own shared painting studio in Paris.
In the 1700s, hosts and hostesses served tea in cups such as this one. To cool a little of the hot liquid at a time, a guest would have poured some tea into the deep saucer and then drunk.Paintings known through engraved copies were popular sources for decoration onporcelainvessels in the 1700s. The porcelain painter tienne-Jean Chabryfils(son), copied the scene on this cup from an engraving of Philip James de Loutherbourg's painting,The Cherished Lamb.The saucer, with its inscriptionL'Avare(The miser), refers to the comedy of the same name by Molire. The paintings on cups and saucers did not necessarily have to relate to each other.
Antoine Singlin fixes the viewer with a steady, piercing gaze. Before his excommunication in 1661, Singlin served as confessor both toLouis XIV, King of France and the philosopherBlaise Pascal. He was also director of Royal-des-Champs and Port-Royal-de-Paris, convents at the center of the severely ascetic religious movement known asJansenism.This psychologically penetrating study captures the fierce personality of the man and his austere beliefs. Philippe de Champaigne placed Singlin in half-length format against a neutralbackground, leaving the viewer little choice but to meet Singlin's direct stare.
A tea pot, lidded sugar bowl, and two cups and saucers made ofsoft-paste porcelainfit neatly onto a flat, lobed tray. These pieces are all shaped in the form of stylized leaves. Unusually, the set does not include a milk jug; as there is no room for one on the tray, one was evidently never made for this set.Each element of this tea service is covered with atin glaze, giving it an even creamy-white color as a ground for the enameled decoration. The  yellow squirrel  pattern repeated on each piece was copied from Japanese porcelain. ThePrince de Cond, owner of the Chantilly Manufactory, had a large collection of Japanese ceramics, which frequently inspired the factory's porcelain painters. The  yellow squirrel  pattern is composed of two rigidly arranged sheaves of wheat contained by turquoise-colored bamboo poles with a yellow squirrel and blue and green flowers.
The Chantilly porcelain manufactory, established about 1725 by thePrince de Cond, made this ornate clock case ofsoft-paste porcelain. The prince owned a large collection of Japanese porcelain, which the factory used as models for its earliest productions. By the time this unique clock was made, the factory had developed its own whimsical interpretations of Asianmotifs, combining an exotic dragon and monkey with European flowers.Clock movements such as this one, designed for the alcoves of bedchambers(pendules d'alcove),were fitted with a cord that struck the nearest hour and a quarter when pulled. This mechanism eliminated the need to light a candle to tell the time.
Oval chamber pots such as this one have been known since the 1700s asbourdaloues. Legend has it that these objects were named after the Jesuit priest Pre Louis Bourdaloue, who preached at the court ofLouis XIV. Bourdaloue's sermons were apparently so long that the ladies at court asked their maids to supply them with chamber pots so that they would not be forced to leave and miss any of his wisdom. Others guess that Bourdoloue himself needed the vessel during his own sermons as he suffered from the disease hypospadias.This chamber pot has scrolling walls shaped like snail shells, while the handle with its flat thumb rest is formed and painted to resemble a twig. The painted flowers on the sides of the vessel resemble designs from Japaneseporcelain. ThePrince de Cond, owner of the Chantilly Manufactory, had a large collection of Japanese ceramics, which frequently inspired the factory's porcelain painters.
Imitating Asian designs in both form and decoration, the Chantilly porcelain manufactory produced these potpourri vases in France. These smiling seated figures with long earlobes, dressed in monks' robes, represent the popular Buddhist god of good fortune or contentment, known asBudai (Put'ai) in China andHo-teiin Japan. In the 1700s, Europeans called these figuresmagots, meaning bizarre or grotesque figures in a Chinese or Japanese style, modeled in a variety of poses. So popular were they that one French writer in the mid-1700s exclaimed that  the taste formagotshas reached the height of stupidity. To create potpourri, fashionable women of the 1700s experimented with dried petals and spices to achieve the finest fragrances, some of which were left to mature for up to nine years. The wealthy liberally used perfumes and potpourri to help disguise malodorous air, as indoor plumbing was nonexistent and frequent bathing was considered unhealthy.
A vaguely boat-shaped form rides the waves, partly supported by a threatening dragon and lifted up above the rocks by a wave that resembles both a shell and a C-scroll. Its piercings allowed the scent of the potpourri inside to escape.Enamel painting in bright blue, green, and deep purple further enlivens the extravagant piece. The artisans used a technique calledpetit feuenamel decoration, firing the glazed and enameled piece in a low-temperature muffle kiln at 700 to 900 degrees, thus permitting a wider and brighter range of colors.The Sceaux factory probably made this vase for an enthusiastic admirer of the excesses of theRococostyle among Parisian society. Since exuberant design and color distinguish the ceramic pieces made by Jacques Chapelle, who became sole proprietor of the Sceaux manufactory outside Paris in 1759, scholars have attributed this vase to him.
Jean-Simon Chardin had the ability to infuse the most ordinary scenes of everyday life with an aura of dignity and value. In this simple drawing, a man wearing a large brimmed hat and long frock coat relaxes with his cane in his hands on a square box or stool and looks away over his right shoulder. Chardin built up the forms with a series of rapid, somewhat heavy, black lines, heightened with additional strokes of white chalk that give a sense of immediacy and vibrancy to the otherwise static image. With a few bold strokes, he established a mood of quiet contemplation generated by his own direct observation and that of the seated man, who gazes off into the distance. Chardin made this figure study in preparation for a painting.On the verso, Chardin drew anacadmie,a study of a nude man, probably made during his early artistic training. All of Chardin's known drawings date from his early career, as he gave up draftsmanship by the 1730s.
 It is the air and light you take with the tip of your brush and fix to your canvas...[your work] exists between nature and art,  wrote Denis Diderot of Jean-Simon Chardin in his Salon review of 1765. In still lifes, genre scenes, and the occasional portrait, Chardin's skill at rendering the visual and tactile qualities of simple objects won him the admiration of critics like Diderot.In this small still life, Chardin portrayed a modest subject--three walnuts, four peaches, two bunches of grapes, and a pewter mug--but gave the objects monumentality by arranging them in pure geometric groupings and concentrating on their basic forms. He suggested the objects' various textures and substances through the play of light across surfaces and successive applications of paint. In this way, Chardin conveyed the fuzzy skin of the peaches, the hard, brittle shell of the walnuts, the translucence of the grapes, and the heavy, cold exterior of the pewter mug.
Nobody has a greater understanding of the harmony of color and reflections. Ah, Chardin, what you grind on yourpaletteis not this color or that, red, black, or white, but the very substance of things.Jean-Simon Chardin impressed criticDenis Diderotwith his unique style and impeccable technique, which he applied to what was then considered a lowlygenre, the still life. Exemplifying what Diderot noticed in his paintings, Chardin here transforms a simple kitchen scene with a subtle palette, innovativecomposition, and virtuoso brushwork.The objects' arrangement is spare but dynamic: Two mackerels hang vertically in front of a plainbackground, perpendicular to an arrangement of food on the tabletop below. Brilliant light directs the eye, attracting attention to the shiny fish, leafy greens, root vegetables, a wheel of cheese, and covered bowls. Although the overall palette is subdued, the oil and vinegar cruets are infused with rich color. The signature and date in the lower right corner are the last Chardin is known to have applied to a still life.
Claude-Joseph Dsir Charnay went to Madagascar in 1863 as part of a government-sponsored expedition to extend French political influence there. When Charnay's party left France, there was a pro-French prince on the throne in Madagascar; by the time they arrived, the prince had been assassinated and the new government had reinstated an official policy of resistance to the French presence.In this tense environment Charnay made photographs of native individuals and ethnic types. As an anthropologist, he was interested in their physical appearance and costumes more than their individual identities. The population of Madagascar was made up of the ruling Hova tribe and the native Madegasse, to which group the women pictured here belonged. The three women and the girl stand in the center of the frame, presenting themselves to the camera in silent formality. Charnay was an enthusiastic imperialist who rather patronizingly described the Madegasse as  of a gentle and timid disposition, faithful and devoted.  He was successful in getting them to pose, representing the island's colonized population in their finery of French printed cotton.
An elegant young man with large, liquid eyes reclines languidly on a large cushion, pausing to look up from his reading. Raymond Henri de Staal de Magnoncourt, elder son of the Comte de Magnoncourt, was about sixteen years old when this drawing was made and dedicated to his mother in the bottom corner. His dreamy expression, rumpled yet elegant clothes, tousled hair, and the overall ambiance of artistic beauty and inspiration vividly capture the essence of the Romantic period.Thodore Chassriau brought a sense of poetry and emotion to his portraiture. He used delicate, almost imperceptible lines to create the sitter's face and hands. Soft shading shapes the boy's round cheek, squashed up under his eye as he rests his head on his hand. In contrast, Chassriau drew the boy's clothing with dark, strong lines, clearly emphasizing the precise, elegant hatching that creates the fabric's shadows and folds.
The severed head ofSaint John the Baptist, executed at the request ofSalome, King Herod's stepdaughter, rests on a charger. According to theBible, Salome's request was prompted by her mother, Herodias, who wanted revenge on theprophetwho had condemned her incestuous marriage toHerod. In later interpretations of the story, Herod and Herodias become symbols of lust and surfeit, and the charger, passed around the table with John's head, becomes a precedent for the ceremony of the Eucharist. The story was particularly popular in the Middle Ages, when images of Saint John's head on a charger were believed to have therapeutic and curative powers. This bronzereliefby Jean-Baptiste Chatigny plays down the gruesome aspects of the story, emphasizing John's surrender instead of the decapitation. Chatigny smoothly cut the neck, blending it into the round edge of the plate while focusing more attention on the upper areas of the face. The loose modeling and imprecise treatment of the surfaces towards the top of the relief, especially apparent in the hair, augment the image's surreal qualities. John's closed eyes and open mouth make him seem all-too-human, emphasizing the pathos and tragedy of his death.
This study of a woman in a loosely fitted dress posed against a studio easel demonstrates one of the earliest uses for which photography was considered appropriate, as a tool for painters and graphic artists. Shortly after photography's emergence in the mid-1800s, a great debate arose over whether or not this technological medium should be regarded as an art form. Many artists argued that photographs could not be considered art because they were made with a mechanical device and chemicals rather than by human hand and spirit. These individuals did however see photography as a useful way to eliminate the drudgery of studying from a live model. Figures posed in studio settings soon became a popular subject. Female figures, as a study in beauty and as a symbol of motherhood, were of great interest to all types of artists during this period.
Richly ornamented with thickly gilded goats' heads, and painted butterflies, birds, and flowers, these vases were intended to be displayed before a mirror, so that both sides of their lavish decoration could be admired. In honor ofLouis XV'sofficial mistress,Madame du Barry, they were namedvases bouc du Barry(goat vases of Barry). The Svres porcelain manufactory sold these vases for the high sum of three hundred and sixtylivres--an amount equivalent to six months' salary for a porcelain painter.Svres artisans made the vases from  true,  hard-paste porcelain, instead of the traditional soft-paste. The hard-paste porcelain recipe was still new, and the craftsmen were still experimenting with different types of decoration when these pieces were produced in 1778. Instead of glazing the vases with ground color and then gilding them, porcelain gilders first applied the gold onto the white body of the vases. Porcelain painters then added enamel colors within the gold outlines. Decorators also experimented with the use of silver on thetrellisworkas seen on these vases, but they soon abandoned this practice since the silver tarnished over time.
In the 1700s, hosts and hostesses served tea in cups such as this one. To cool a little of the hot liquid at a time, a guest would have poured some tea into the deep saucer and then drunk.Paintings known through engraved copies were popular sources for decoration onporcelainvessels in the 1700s. The porcelain painter tienne-Jean Chabryfils(son), copied the scene on this cup from an engraving of Philip James de Loutherbourg's painting,The Cherished Lamb.The saucer, with its inscriptionL'Avare(The miser), refers to the comedy of the same name by Molire. The paintings on cups and saucers did not necessarily have to relate to each other.
The olive branches and grape vines that decorate the stand for this sauceboat suggest it was originally intended to hold oil and vinegar. The handled  boat  can be removed from the stand for serving or washing.In the 1700s, meals were served according to strict ritual, known asservice  la franaise. The first course was already precisely laid out on the table when the diners were seated. The dishes remained in their respective places on the table throughout the meal, while the guests served themselves from the choice of dishes within their reach. At least one servant attended each diner, going round the table to collect food from the various dishes. This practice required numerous plates and serving dishes. The new culinary trend for soups, stews, and dishes with sauces also increased demand for specialized vessels such as this sauceboat.
Simon de Varie, who served in the French royal treasury under Charles VII and whom the king had recently raised to noble rank, commissioned a book of hours, which was completed in 1455. This richly illuminated private prayer book includes a calendar of church holidays and texts for devotional services inspired by the eight daily services of the divine office. The rise in literacy among the merchant and noble classes and their desire to express a newly emotional personal piety, particularly in veneration of the Virgin Mary, spurred the popularity of books of hours in the 1400s. In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.
This tinyCorinthianblack-figurearyballosshows a combination of painted and modeled decoration. The painted decoration on the body is divided into three zones. The main zone, the middle, shows three goats. Alotusbud with floral scrolls adorns the shoulder, and rays surround the base. The neck and mouth of the aryballos are modeled in the form of a woman's head. If not purely decorative, the meaning of this head is unknown to scholars. Aryballoi with modeled heads of humans and animals seem to be a specialty of this workshop; they were probably related to plastic vases, which were popular in the mid-600s B.C. Aryballoi were used to hold perfumed oil. The vessel's narrow opening was designed to restrict the flow of this precious commodity.
An animalfriezeencircles the body of thisCorinthianblack-figurepyxis. Real and mythological creatures, including lions, a goat, a bull, and a beardedsiren, make up the decoration. Their stylized, sharply outlined bodies rhythmically balance against one another. Rosettes fill the spaces around the animals. Above this, alotusandpalmettechain decorates the shoulder of the vessel. In place of handles, the potter has added mold-made female heads.The pyxis was a container for perfumed oils and cosmetics. Beginning around 575 B.C., Corinthian potters occasionally added mold-made heads to these vessels. By the early 500s B.C., Corinthian pottery, with its simple and repetitive yet elegant decoration, had completely taken over the pottery market and became widely exported throughout the Mediterranean.
Carved out of a single block of gleaming white marble, thisallegoricalportrait represents the Van Risamburgh family in a sweet and affectionate commemorative portrait.  Lovingly looking down, Madame van Risamburgh, dressed asMinerva, goddess of wisdom and war in ancient mythology, raises her shield as a canopy over her languidly slumbering young son. He is improbably perched on a pile of military equipment and holds a sword or dagger that is clearly too large for him in his right hand. Monsieur van Risamburgh, a prominent Lyon merchant, is represented by his profilemedallionportrait on a shield at the base. The medallion format, traditionally used for tomb monuments, implies that, although still living, he is absent from the family. Through the use of allegory, sculptor Joseph Chinard suggested that Madame van Risamburgh was protecting her son from current civil and military unrest while her husband was away, possibly engaged in military or civic duties.A popularNeoclassicalartist, Chinard drew on ancient mythology and usedclassicalforms but imbued the work with a very contemporary emotional feeling, celebrating family life as the source of happiness.
With a melancholy air, an elegant woman and her young son contemplate the medallion portrait of an absent husband and father. While the affectionate child nuzzles his mother's arm, she props up the medallion on her elegant Empire style daybed. Sculptor Joseph Chinard paid great attention to stylish details such as elegant furniture and the woman's hairstyle and dress. Although he included such popular artistic conventions as a revealed breast, he also expressed her deep longing through her gentle manner and intense look. To make this love theme explicit, the artist used symbolic props such as the putti on the sides of the bed. The putto on the right represents earthly sensual love, while the one on the left, with his eyes bound shut, represents heavenly spiritual love. Together they hold the rope that symbolically binds the family together.Chinard created this keepsake for the French Duhesme family, using a format traditionally reserved for tombs, where the medallion identifies the deceased. Since the figure represented in the medallion, General Philippe Guillaume Duhesme, was still living when this sculpture was made, the medallion signifies absence rather than death.
Coyly looking down, Madame Recamier holds a veil across her chest. The sheath both demurely conceals and reveals her breasts. Sculptor Joseph Chinard cleverly compensated for the artificiality of thebustform by elongating the bust to mid-torso and covering the transition between the body and pedestal with drapery, creating a work of surprisingnaturalism. The softly modeled limbs and the slight twists of her head and shoulders suggest a living presence while the upswept hairstyle suggests Recamier's elegance.Juliette Recamier was celebrated in French Empire society for her beauty and love affairs. Married at fifteen to a wealthy lawyer who may have been her natural father, she had a loveless, unconsummated marriage and carried on numerous flagrant affairs, the most celebrated with the Prussian PrinceAugustus, the youngest brother of King Frederick II. In her Parisian townhouse, she held a fashionableliterary salonfrequented by the political and educated elite. Some of the most accomplished portraitists of the era sculpted, drew, and painted her image. Chinard'sterracottabust, considered one of the most successful at capturing her spirit and beauty, was produced in several different versions in both clay and marble.
The Greek heroHerakleswrestlesTriton, a fish-tailed being, on this Athenianblack-figureolpeor pitcher. Herakles, identified by his lionskin, sits astride Triton, who writhes away from the hero, trying to break his grip. The figures are so closely intertwined that it is difficult to tell them apart. The battle of Herakles and Triton first appeared in Greek art about 565 B.C. and was especially popular in the period from about 530 to 510 B.C. No ancient author recorded the story of Herakles and Triton. This lack of literary sources for the depiction and the fact that it appears almost exclusively in Athenian art has led some scholars to look for a special meaning in the scene. The mythological battle may have had symbolic political significance for the Athenians. The tyrants who ruled Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, may have adopted Herakles as their symbol; and the scene may refer to a naval victory of Athens over her neighboring enemy, the city-state of Megara.
In this drawing the artist focused on expressing light's ability to shape form. The horse's three-dimensionality and the haloed saint's armor are rendered in a wide range from light to dark, resulting in the effect of rounded, physical forms. In some areas, work began with stylus underdrawing, which the artist then drew over and elaborated on with red chalk.Scholars are uncertain about the subject of this drawing and its purpose. The drawing probably copies another work of art,The Death of Marcus Curtius,painted by an artist close to Giovanni Battista Cima da Conegliano. The drawing includes very fewpentimenti, areas showing the artist making corrections and changing his mind, increasing the likelihood that the maker was following a pre-existing example. A copyist might have drawn in the black chalk arcs joining the horses' hooves as a guide, since they serve no compositional purpose.
Severe yet sensual, the Roman goddess of Love's well-modeled, undulating curls and upswept hair provide a delicate contrast to the unblemished skin which is polished to a high shine. Shown in a gesture of modesty as if suddenly surprised, she appears in a classic pose known as the  chaste Venus  or Medici Venus after a famous life-size Hellenistic marble. Her eyes are slightly textured giving them the appearance of depth.The artist's name is inscribed in Latin on the plinth, or supporting base, of the sculpture. TheVenus--along with Cipriani'sDancing Faun--was created for display at Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, the seat or country house of the patron for these works. After casting, the artist destroyed the original plasters to prevent a second use, making the works even more extraordinary. Whereas many such sculptures were displayed unprotected outdoors in gardens, these were not. The condition of the bronze has therefore retained much of the freshness of its original appearance, without staining or pitting of the surface.Cipriani'sVenusis based on a Hellenistic statue that has been on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since the second half of the 1600's. Such copies of Greco-Roman statuary were popular among contemporary wealthy art collectors who wanted their own versions of ancient art seen during their travels in Europe and Greece on what was known as the  grand tour.  This particular sculpture, however, takes the  souvenir  type to the extreme, as it is a large, full-scale work, difficult to transport, and of such high artistic quality.In the marble version, the work features a support to Venus' leg in the form of a putto riding a dolphin. Cipriani eliminates this element, whose stability is not required in the bronze medium. Some scholars see his choice as possibly inspired by the notion that the ancient marbles were actually copies of lost bronze originals.
This dancing faun is now more precisely identified as a satyr. Satyrs are roguish figures from ancient mythology and literature known for their love of wine, music, and mischief. This satyr holds metalcymbalain his hands and wears akroupezionattached to his sandal. This is a device with a metal plate that would have made a noise rather like a modern tap shoe. His 'faun' features are visible in the tiny horns above his forehead, and in the small goat's tail at his rear. His head is bent over, absorbed by the music, and every muscle of his athletic body seems tensed as he plays; from his deltoid muscles to his abdomen, and down to his calves.The artist's name is inscribed in Latin on the plinth, or supporting base, of the sculpture. TheDancing Faun--along with Cipriani'sVenus--was created for display at Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, the seat or country house of the patron for these works. After casting, the artist destroyed the original plasters to prevent a second use, making the works even more extraordinary. Whereas many such sculptures were displayed unprotected outdoors in gardens, these were not. However, theDancing FaunandVenuswere kept indoors. The condition of the bronze has therefore retained much of the freshness of its original appearance, without staining or pitting of the surface.Cipriani'sFaunis based on a Hellenistic statue that has been on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since the second half of the 1600s. Such copies of Greco-Roman statuary were popular among contemporary wealthy art collectors who wanted their own versions of ancient art seen during their travels in Europe and Greece on what was known as the  grand tour.  This particular sculpture, however, takes the 'souvenir' type to the extreme, as it is a large, full-scale work, difficult to transport, and of such high artistic quality.
Antoine Claudet, who learned thedaguerreotypeprocess from Louis-Jacques-Mand Daguerre himself, poses with his son Francis in the richly appointed studio setting that was a trademark of his stereographic portraits. The lush detail of tasseled curtains, parrot, decorated vase, and focimeter--a device to measure distance in order to determine focus--undoubtedly provided a striking effect when the image was viewed in three dimensions through thestereographviewer. Part of an experiment to measure exact distances in the studio as indicated by the white placard reading  8 IN   22 feet  in the lower left corners, this portrait underscores Claudet's efforts to ensure the sharp definition of the stereograph image.
A woman dressed as a priestess leads a young girl, covering herself with a swath of cloth, toward a statue of Priapus, the ancient god of fertility. With distinctive goatlike ears, Priapus appears in the form of a term, a statue marking a territorial boundary. The smoking incense and the sacrificial tripod indicate that the young girl is making an offering of her charms. Cupid winds a floral garland around the statue of Priapus, camouflaging his characteristic erect phallus.Sculptor Claude Michel, called Clodion, frequently drew from ancient mythology for his terracottas, but his borrowings rarely focused on grand events. For Clodion, ancient culture provided a classical figure style, a repertory of characters and settings, and perhaps most importantly, a nostalgic mood. As was typical of the Rococo style, his works tended to be playful and erotic.Although Clodion finished the piece in the round, he designed it to be seen from the front, placed on a piece of furniture or on a mantelpiece. Known for his masterful handling of wet clay, the artist focused on texture, differentiating clingy or billowing drapery from satin-textured skin.
The thing I like about a photograph is that it represents a frozen, poemlike moment in time. It remains constant, and the painting, however long it takes to make, is always about that quintessential moment.--Chuck CloseAlthough it took months for Chuck Close to complete a monumental painting of fellow painter April Gornik, the portrait reflects a brief moment in time because it was based on a photograph. Close, best known for his large-scale, detailed paintings of portrait heads, begins each new work with an extreme close-up, usually of a face, taped to a board. The photograph is thensquaredso it can be enlarged and transferred by hand to canvas. The enormity of the completed painting magnifies each realistic detail of the subject's appearance, including wrinkles and freckles. Along the right-hand border of this image, Close tested a range of paint colors in an attempt to find the appropriate balance for the painting.
Close created a series of portraits and figure studies in collaboration with the daguerreotypist Jerry Spagnoli, who has mastered this antiquated process, requiring the use of hard-to-obtain, highly toxic materials. Close, mostly known for his variations on the human face, here experimented with skin as pure form. In choosing a small-busted woman as his model, Close blurred the line between female and male.
In this study, Gilles-Franois-Joseph Closson challenged his technical abilities and powers of close observation by painting directly from nature without first making a line drawing. Increasingly, Closson and his contemporaries of the early 1800s were painting landscapes outdoors, using not only watercolor but oil on paper. By immediately rendering his observations in paint, Closson developed his skill at reproducing nature's myriad, constantly shifting colors. He used the oil paint's thickness and saturated, opaque colors to invest the simple leaves with a powerful visual impact.The butterburr, also known as bog rhubarb, has enormous leaves, which Closson showed in varying phases, from verdant green to withered purplish-brown. At the center, a leaf is beginning to change color, midway between life and death. Closson's choice of a close viewpoint and monumental treatment of what might otherwise seem a trivial subject lead the viewer to contemplate the cyclical nature of life. This theme of the brevity of human life and the transience of earthly pleasures was often treated in still lifes and flower pictures.
This fashionably dressed young woman sits back in a comfortably padded chair and turns her head, facing the viewer with a clear, direct gaze. She wears a ruffled white headdress perched on top of her upswept hair and an elegant dress with a large bow on the bodice. The triple layers of ruffles on her sleeves are fashionably arranged to match the lacy layers on her cap and the ruffles modestly draped around her neck. Using only black chalk, Charles-Nicolas Cochin created a dynamiccompositionout of a single figure. His delicate strokes suggest not only the silky texture of her dress, but also the softly dimpled flesh around her mouth and chin.Greatly admired by his contemporaries, Cochin's draftsmanship was always praised for his technical perfection. He was a prolific portrait artist, producing over 250 portrait drawings, all of them small scale and with their sitters shown in thebustlength format. This drawing was probably made as an independent work of art, and not in preparation for a painting. It might have been displayed in the private sitting room or bedroom of a house, perhaps as part of a group of family pictures.
Nicolas Michel Cury's slight smile suggests that although he held an important position in the court ofLouis XV'sgovernment, he was not entirely without humor. Leisure and entertainment were a significant part of Parisian social life, and Cury seems to have possessed the wit and quick mind essential to ensuring success in social and professional circles. Charles-Nicolas Cochin's bust-length portrait of the thirty-two-year-old royal administrator of the forestry department shows a charming member of fashionable, high society in pre-Revolutionary France.
Pieter Coecke van Aelst captured the distress of Saint Paul and Barnabas upon discovering that the people of the city of Lystra, to whom they preached the gospel, had begun to worship them as pagan gods, calling BarnabasJupiterand PaulMercury.The priest of Jupiter brought oxen and garlands to his temple in order to make sacrifices, but when Paul and Barnabas saw what was occurring, they tore their clothes in fury and frustration. The main drama unfolds before a magnificent temple housing a statue of Jupiter. Below, the priest and followers converge upon an ornately carved altar with sacrificial animals. On the right, Paul strides towards the crowd with an anguished expression on his face as he tears his robe, while Barnabas throws up his arms in frustration. The vignettes in the upper left and right corners show two other scenes from Paul's life, being stoned and dragged outside the city and healing a man who had never walked.Coecke produced the drawing as a cartoon for one of nine tapestries on the life of Saint Paul. The intricate design of this jewel-like drawing contrasts with the monumental scale of the final tapestry.
Pieter Coecke van Aelst combined various scenes into a continuous narrative that proceeds left to right like a cartoon strip. The prodigal son takes leave of his father, lavishes his money on worldly pleasures at a brothel, gets chased away by prostitutes, lands in a pigsty, and finally reconciles with his father. In the 1500s, this popular parable taught about the sin of extravagance and the virtue of forgiveness. In contrast to the text of the Bible, which emphasizes the father's final act of forgiveness, artists and patrons of that period often focused lively attention on the brothel scene. Coecke set it further forward than the rest of the action, with the detailed landscape and architectural passages of the other episodes forming an elaborate backdrop. Emphasizing attractive outlines, he filled the entire drawing with elegantly proportioned figures. Scholars believe that the drawing's large scale and horizontal format suggest that Coecke might have made it as a tapestry design.
After theBible, theConsolation of Philosophyby the Roman philosopher and statesman Boethius was the most widely read book in the Middle Ages. Boethius wrote the work, a dialogue between its author and thepersonificationof Philosophy, in prison while awaiting trial for treason. Discussing the problem of evil and the conflict between free will and divine providence, Philosophy explains the changeable nature ofFortuneand consoles Boethius in his adversity.The Getty Museum owns a series ofcuttingsfrom a luxurious French copy of the text(Consolation de philosophie),which the Cotivy Masterilluminatedin Paris around the 1460s. Theminiaturesgive concrete visual expression to the philosophical ideas, assuring their place in the reader's memory.
At the left, Philosophy, personified as a fashionably dressed young woman, visits Boethius, who had lost his exalted position as Roman envoy. She asks him why he is despondent, saying,  you are wrong if you think thatFortunehas changed towards you. Change is her normal behavior.  On the right, Fortune, a beautiful woman, spins her wheel, which represents the changes she brings about in men's lives. A king sits on top of the wheel, but a simple turn of the wheel can bring him down in station while it raises the fortunes of another. Philosophy demonstrates that Fortune rules the world and that the wise person ignores her ever-shifting ways, preferring eternal truths.
On the far left, Boethius speaks to Philosophy, who was his  sovereign comfort,  as the inscription between them reads. Philosophy presents him withpersonificationsof the sevenliberal arts, the basic studies taught in medieval universities, emphasizing that they assist the study of philosophy. From left to right, an inscription and anattributeidentify each of the liberal arts: Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Music, Geometry, Arithmetic, and Astronomy. Grammar, for example, holds an open book; Music holds a sheet of music. All seven are represented as young women dressed at the height of fashion, headed by Philosophy who herself wears an elaborate headdress known as an hennin.
Thiscuttingprobably accompanied the final chapter of Boethius'sThe Consolation of Philosophy,where Boethius and Philosophy, personified as an elegant woman, discuss the nature of God. God appears above in a brilliantly colored, glowing aureole surrounded by cherubim and seraphim. This God, depicted as an elderly man, holds an orb in his left hand that symbolizes his dominion over the earth while offering a sign of blessing with his right. The text that once accompanied this image explained that,  God has foreknowledge and rests a spectator from on high. . . . the ever-present eternity of his Vision dispenses reward to the good and punishment to the bad. 
After 1850, France's railroads expanded rapidly under private ownership and with the encouragement ofNapoleon III. Both the government and private owners of railroads commissioned photographs to attract new investors to the transportation system; theChemin de Fer du Bourbonnais(Bourbonnais Railway Company) assigned Hippolyte-Auguste Collard to make this photograph, an interior view of a roundhouse, a building for servicing and housing locomotives. Roundhouses were less efficient than rectangular buildings because of their single rotating center slab that moved the locomotives into their berths. But that fact would never be deduced from this gleaming, orderly interior, a model of efficiency.Each identical engine aligns perfectly with the hood that draws the steam from the pipe, thus keeping the building clear of poisonous carbon monoxide fumes. Using awide-angle lens, Collard has photographed the scene to maximize the room's spatial configuration, and in doing so he has flattened theperspective. The engines appear to be miniatures: only the door visible at the lower center edge between two engines gives an indication of the interior's actual scale and the technical feat that Collard achieved in rendering such a sweeping view.
In the 1800s new railroads demanded a new kind of building: the railroad station. Gare de Nevers, a modest station in a provincial area, exemplifies the glass-and-iron building type that French architects and engineers developed in response to this need. Combining a train shed and a passenger building, the railroad station had to provide an area wide enough to accommodate parallel tracks and tall enough to diffuse smoke and steam from the train's engine. This station's shed is so large that the engine waiting beneath it looks miniature. Beside the shed, doors lead to the passenger building, where people could purchase tickets, dispose of luggage, await departure or arrival, and generally make the jolting transition between the familiar urban world and the realm of steam and speed.
The subject is the Viaduct of Auteuil, an elaborate, two-story, 1,073-meter-long viaduct with 151 arches that spanned the distance between the town of Auteuil and the Point-du-Jour bridge outside Paris. Although the absolute symmetry of the bridge and light posts is compelling and might have attracted another photographer, Hippolyte-Auguste Collard made a less obvious choice, positioning his camera at the end of the Point du Jour, slightly off-center and toward the middle of the right pedestrian arcade. This view establishes an unobstructed line of sight to a point in the far distance, making the viaduct seem infinite. The shadowy sweep of the bridge overhead fans out of the frame like a lopsided crown, while a puddle of water just in front of the left pedestrian passageway, whose arch bears the stains of seeping water, suggests a more mundane problem threatening the impressive structure.
The railroad necessitated a straight and even path, which often involved cutting through the landscape, building embankments, and constructing viaducts. Hippolyte-August Collard's photographs of the Bourbonnais Railway in France show the stages of constructing a bridge, its use as a roadway, and finally its completed sculptural form. Two paddleboats appear in the image on the left, manned by gentlemen who were evidently indifferent to the raucous construction. In the central photograph, a train halts along the newly completed bridge, while numerous individuals pose atop its freight cars. Finally, in the last image, the bridge stands alone, having taken its position as the landscape's defining feature.Collard made the initial photograph showing construction in the summer of 1865. He returned to the site along the Loing in December 1866 to make the two subsequent images, positioning his camera in nearly the same location for each document.
Mary's beatifically idealized face reflects the heavenly light emanating from the glowing babyJesus. Attractive young women coo over the infant, an old man whispers to a bare-chested shepherd cradling a sheep at the far left, and two birds rest contentedly at the foot of the rustic manger. Though on the earthly plane, a young boy holding a dove and shading his eyes in theforegroundseems more like a sibling to the heavenlyputtiholding a scroll and a censer over the newbornChrist.The young Sebastiano Conca successfully blended thisBaroquewealth of activity with a symmetrical,classicizingcompositioncentered on the manger. Despite the painting's expansive scale, his brilliant handling lends a cool sweetness that points toward theRococostyle.Conca painted this picture for Rome's most adventurouspatron,CardinalPietro Ottoboni. He may also have used this painting as a model for an altar frontal, a pillow-like plaque decoration.
An unknown artist created this haunting scene filled with a maze of paths and aged, gnarled trees casting looming shadows. By using black paper and showing the forest at night, he accentuated nature's drama. Moonlight glints off twisted roots and leaves, piercing into the groves in the distance, partially illuminating but never fully revealing what is taking place. Humans appear only in the background, framed by the twisted tree trunks: two tiny figures making their way to the moated fortress at the left. The drawing's large scale and the artist's use of grisaille make it rare among the relatively common Dutch and Flemish drawings rendered in colored wash around 1600. At this time, some artists began to depict the forest as a place of mystery. Gillis van Coninxloo and his followers, known for their close-up views of nature, were among this group.
William Constable was both an artist and inventor. Here he showed off his most recent scientific invention: an improved regulating device to increase the efficiency of steam power. Constable placed himself with the invention behind him on his right. Rather than position the invention in center frame, Constable shifted it to the left so as to include himself proudly clasping the device. The composition calls as much attention to his own role as inventor as to the invention itself.
Dimitrios Constantin documented a fragment of a sculpturalreliefshowing the figure of a maenad draped in heavily stylized robes; suggesting movement, the drapery undulates over her form. In ancient Greek mythology,maenadswere female devotees of the godDionysos. Through a frenzy of dancing, drinking, and eating-usually raw flesh--the women became possessed with the god's spirit.
In France in the 1700s, precise rules governed the arrangement of a formal room. Console tables were generally intended for a specific place, as they were considered part of the interior architecture. Architects often designed them, usually specifying carved decoration that matched the wall paneling and mirror frames.The carved shells, leafy scrolls, and basket of flowers on this console are all similar to a pair of tables created for the Danish ambassador to the court of Louis XV. Baron de Bernstorff, an ardent Francophile, ordered the architect Pierre Contant d'Ivry to produce designs for the furniture and interiors of his house in Copenhagen. Among the works produced were a pair of console tables that are similar both in their overall design and in their carved details to the Getty Museum's piece.
Modeled in the form of three laurel branches tied with a ribbon, these massive wall lights with their detailed chasing and burnishing reveal the extraordinary skill of their maker, a silversmith to Louis XV, king of France. Each wall light is slightly different from the others.These four wall lights are among eight made in 1756 for the newly redecorated interiors of the famous Parisian palace, the Palais-Royal, which was the residence of the king's cousin, Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orlans. Shortly after inheriting the building in 1752, he commissioned the architect Pierre Contant d'Ivry to renovate the main rooms. Engravings of these rooms, showing the wall lights in place, were reproduced in Diderot'sEncyclopdie,one of the principal works of the Age of Enlightenment. An inscription on the Getty Museum's drawing for one of these wall lights explains that it should hang above the fireplace.
Aging and hairy, the photographer's nude body is presented in this triple-exposure in two profile views and one frontal view. It is a vulnerable revelation of the body's imperfections rendered in graphic detail. John Coplans has cropped his body across the upper chest and lower legs, emphasizing his torso, with its folds and spots made more severe by the deep shadows cast by the harsh, unforgiving lighting. Like a latter-day Three Graces composition, the multiple bodies interact in a dance-like posture, bending forward and back, legs extended in motion and carefully posed in side-by-side symmetry.
French craftsmen at Svres designed these vases to hold flowering plants and soil in the upper trumpet-shaped section. Water, added through openings in the lower base, fed the plants through small holes pierced near the base of the soil container. The two separate sections permitted easy removal of plants or excess water.The Svresporcelainmanufactory produced this design in five different sizes. Immensely popular, these vases sold in large quantities up until theFrench Revolution.
On one side of this sheet, the recto, Michel Corneille the Younger described the faces and bodies of the Madonna and Child and additional heads, possibly Saint Joseph and the infant Saint John the Baptist, in red chalk. Red chalk had long been popular for drawing the human figure and for rendering pinkish-tan flesh tones because of its rosy color. By liberally laying in white chalk, Corneille created a sensuous play of light over the Christ Child's skin and described the diaphanous fabric loosely draped around the fleshy infant's body. To further heighten the brilliance of the red and white chalks, he chose blue paper as his support. The combination of red, white, and black chalk is a technique known by French term coined in the 1700s,aux trois crayons.On the verso, Corneille drew theMadonna and Child with Saint John Seated in a Landscapein pen and ink, suggesting tonal areas with brownwashand black chalk. The copying of figures from the recto and the more complete nature of the composition suggest that the verso drawing was made after the recto. The interior framing lines and the precise outlined figures suggest that this drawing was made in preparation for an engraving.
In this dark, erotic scene, it was the extended and twisted poses of the two male nudes that interested Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem, not their facial expressions. The larger man turns his head away from the viewer, grasping the young boy's foot in his left hand, his right arm sensually wrapped around the boy's body. The boy sits splay-legged, leaning back against the man's arm with his face hidden in the forceful embrace of the man.Van Haarlem used modulated tones to suggest texture as revealed by gradations of light. Gleaming highlights reflect off the smooth, muscular bodies, showing off the dimpled texture of their flesh. Delicate white, almost frothy strokes form the leafy trees in the background.
A countryside path cuts across a mustard-yellow field and slopes downward toward a small village. Under a cloudless sky, crisp, strong sunlight brightens a zigzag row of roofs and chimneys. Contrasting shadows are cast from rooftop to rooftop. In the right foreground, a less sharply defined verdant mass balances the geometrical order of the architecture.During the summer of 1830, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot left his native Paris and traveled in northern and central France. The oil study was most likely produced during this sojourn. Corot painted the view in the out-of-doors. Scholars believe this work was not intended for exhibition or sale nor did it serve as a preliminary study for a larger picture. Instead, it is likely the work remained in Corot's studio as an exploration of the effects of light and nature on geometric architectural forms.
Composed from memories and from drawings made during Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot's travels in Italy, this view is probably a pendant toLandscape with Lake and Boatman, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1839. First purchased by different collectors, scholars thought the canvases were lost for several decades, until they were offered to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1984. The two paintings depict ideal Italian views that contrast different times of day, emulating the works of Corot's seventeenth-century countryman Claude Lorrain.The golden morning light bathes this landscape of singing and dancing peasants with antique ruins in the background. To the left, picturesque cows wade in the reflective water, and a contemporary townscape appears in the distance. Like Lorrain, Corot presented a utopian setting in which ancient and modern culture coexist in lyrical harmony.
After a long day, a solitary boatman poles his boat ashore across the water's placid surface. An array of colors--citron, lavender, turquoise, and rose--fills the sky as the sun slowly sets. Light reflects against the trees, turning the edges and foliage yellow-orange; the pool of water shimmers with reflections. The dramatically colored backlighting and the tiny, lone man create a sense of melancholy and longing that appealed to the Romantic critics of the time.Composing from memories and from drawings made during his travels in Italy, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot painted this view for the Paris Salon of 1839. It may be a pendant toItalian Landscape, which he painted the same year. Until they were offered to the Getty Museum in 1984, scholars thought both paintings were lost. The two paintings depict ideal Italian views that contrast different times of day, emulating the works of Corot's seventeenth-century countryman Claude Lorrain.
Correggio softly contoured and modeled the figures in theforegroundwith pronouncedsfumato, especially the man on the bull.He typically employed this sensuous handling of figures, which he had adopted from Leonardo da Vinci. In contrast with the careful modeling of form and detail in the figures, Correggio rendered the landscape with quick gestures of chalk. This is a rare drawing from his early years and one of the few he made using black chalk.Scholars are uncertain about the subject of this drawing, but the prominence of a nude man riding a bull in the foreground and figures massed in thebackgroundsuggests a literary source in Greek and Roman mythology.
Correggio made this drawing as a preparatory study for thefrescodecorations in the church of Saint John the Evangelist in Parma. The fresco was meant to be viewed from underneath an arch, with the spectator looking upwards toward the majestic figure of Christ.Correggio stressed Christ's heavenly nature through subtle modulations of light and dark. He combined red chalk and opaque white to produce a range of pinks that enhance the drawing's delicacy and atmospheric effects. Watercolorwashin brown and gray and touches of opaque white describe figures and clouds, lending the drawing a soft, almost airy quality.
In traditional format,Saint Matthewsits cross-legged with pen in hand, while an angel, the saint'sattribute, supports Mathew's book. To capture an idea quickly, Correggio sketched with great freedom and speed. Here he used loops and squiggles to show Saint Matthew's hair and cursory, broken lines to shape the saint's body. The facial features are smudged, a technique Correggio used to achieve the softness characteristic of his work. This animated sketch may be an early idea for a corner of a curved ceiling in the cupola of a church in Parma. In the final painting, the saint and the angel appear withSaint Jerome.
As Christ stumbled under the weight of the cross he bore on the way to his crucifixion, Saint Veronica comforted him and wiped his face with her veil. According to legend, Christ's features were miraculously imprinted on the fabric. In this haunting depiction, Correggio painted Veronica's veil as the white cloth in the background. Christ faces the viewer and parts his lips as if to speak.Through the use of strong light and shadow as seen in the defined cheekbones, line of the nose, and hollow of the neck, Correggio gave his forms a sense of volume. He further used light to emphasize the image's poignancy, placing the left half of Christ's face in shadow while the right side receives light. The subject matter and small size of theHead of Christprobably indicate that it was made for private devotional use.
Jan Cossiers probably drew this portrait sketch of his son Cornelis from life. He quickly captured the tilt of his son's head as he stares fixedly over his right shoulder. Loose, flowing strokes capture his strong profile, slightly open mouth, and tousled, shoulder-length hair. Black chalk delineates the boy's features, such as the hair, upturned nose and prominent upper lip, while subtle touches of red chalk describe the flesh tones.Cossiers made many sketches of his children, including the six sons from his second wife. He arranged the sketches, few of which survive, in accordance with the children's ages, beginning with the sheet representing the youngest boy. The number36in the upper left corner of the sheet indicates that there were once at least thirty-six numbered drawings grouped together.
Using only pen and ink, Lorenzo Costa portrayed the cradle of Christian monasticism, the Thebaid, a Roman division of the upper Nile River valley. Beginning with Saint Paul of Thebes and Saint Anthony of Egypt in the 200s, Christian monks retreated to this region, to live a solitary life of ascetism and prayer. Over time, these monks, also known as  desert fathers,  organized into communities.Costa's scratchy, energetic draftmanship created a bustling composition filled with monks and a landscape riddled with the grottoes, huts, and caves they used for prayer and shelter. He portrayed an imaginary scene, incorporating a variety of monastic saints and spanning different periods. In the upper left background, Saints Paul and Anthony are shown seated, receiving bread from a raven through which God provided nourishment. Mary Magdalene, who supposedly lived her later years alone in the desert, stands near the river to the right. The landscape itself appears more European than Egyptian, perhaps reflecting Costa's native countryside around Bologna, Italy, rather than the real Thebaid.
Placido Costanzi made this modello, or presentation sketch, in preparation for an apsefrescoin a Roman church. He may have shown this highly finished oil study to his patrons for approval before embarking on the actual architectural decoration. Costanzi incorporated the curving ribs of the apse, which would have been carved or molded gilt plaster in the church itself, into the ornamental decoration as a frame for the Virgin.Above an elaborate sunburst with her monogram, the Virgin Mary dominates the central panel. Saint Luke, holding a scroll that reads  Ecce Virgo or  Behold the Virgin,  occupies the left panel, and Saint John the Evangelist looks up at her from the right. Costanzi used the typical lightpalette, weightlessputtiand angels, and artificial sky of ItalianRococoarchitectural decorators.
In this doublepastelportrait, the brothers Joseph and John Gulston appear close-up in half-length, standing before an expanse of wooded landscape. The elder brother, Joseph, age thirteen, wears a  Van Dyck  costume, a costume in the style of Anthony van Dyck's portrait paintings from the 1600s. Also in a historicizing vein, his younger brother John wears a dress, traditionally worn by both boys and girls until they reached four years of age, and holds a wicker basket full of colorful summer blossoms. Francis Cotes captured his sitters with disarming directness. Joseph bears himself gracefully and engages the viewer with his gaze, yet he still retains the fragile self-reserve typical of an older boy. His brother John, however, caught in three-quarter view, moves and smiles with the unselfconscious spontaneity of a four-year-old. The contrast between the two boys' ages, clothing, and actions indicates that the subject is more than a likeness of two children--it serves as a commentary on the passage of childhood.
A phlyax play enacted on a simple stage decorates the front of thisApulianred-figurebell-krater. Phlyax plays, popular in the 300s and 200s B.C. in the Greek colonies in Italy, were farces parodying either heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life. On this vase, the play mocks the amorous adventures ofZeus, the king of the gods. An old man with a straggly beard, marked as Zeus by his crown and eagle-topped scepter, advances lecherously toward a woman in the middle of the stage. Unlike the beautiful maidens Zeus usually pursues, she is portrayed as an old woman with short white hair, wrinkles, a stubby nose, and thick lips. A slave stands at the left watching the action. The figures wear the distinctive costume of phlyax actors: a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus. In contrast to the raucous action on the front, the back of the vase depicts a quiet scene of a youth and two women.
This melon-shaped vase is a fine example of the bold and innovative forms introduced at the Svres porcelain factory in the 1760s. Produced in the earlyNeoclassicalstyle, known asgot grec(Greek taste), these designs used simpler, more sculptural decoration than in the past. Architecturalmotifssuch as the acanthus spikes inset in the fluted sides of the vase replaced painted flowers and landscapes, and ground colors became richer.
Documents in the Svres porcelain manufactory archives call these vesselsvases  ttes de bouc( goat's head  vases), after their elaborate handles modeled in the form of rams' heads with grape vines hanging from their mouths. Despite their removable stoppers, these vases were purely decorative objects, serving no practical purpose.The distinctive decoration of bold patterns ingildingover a dark blue ground is typical of a style popular in the 1760s. The Svres manufactory only introduced this deep blue glaze, known first asbleu nouveau(new blue) thenbeau bleu(beautiful blue), in 1763.
The grape leaf crown atop this young woman's head implies that she is one of the many followers of Bacchus, revelers who lived lives of drunkenness and sexual abandon in the classical past. Her costume however, reveals that she was a contemporary of the artist. Scholars believe that the young woman depicted is actually one of Gustave Courbet's four sisters, Zlie. Her closed eyes and softly parted lips reveal that she has fallen into a state of deep slumber. Courbet contributed a sense of psychological complexity to the drawing by depicting her in dark shadows.This richly toned drawing illustrates Courbet's disdain for the clean lines prescribed by the French Academy. He preferred to use thick deposits of cont crayon, vigorously smudged, to create texture and convey mood. This monumental life-sized drawing, like many of his paintings, was meant to create a jolting visual impact. Although Courbet included his formal signature in the lower right corner of the drawing, he also prominently placed his characteristic lower-casegon the young woman's neck, below her tendrils.
 To paint human beings, and paint them well--that's the really difficult thing,  said Gustave Courbet. His corpulent women shocked his critics, who were accustomed to less earthy depictions of the female form.Though Courbet painted many female nudes, only two of his drawings of this subject survive. For thiscomposition, Courbet modified the traditional academic nude study, theacadmie,into a more ordinary, less classically refined figure. He depicted a modern woman, but herclassicalpose and his sensitive modulation of form and careful rendering of flesh tones recall his study of theOld Mastersin theMuse du Louvre.Courbet made this drawing for a friend who remains unidentified. His inscription--Mon Vieux, C'en est une qu'on enverra  Sainte Beuve s'il nous embte! Gustave Ct. 28 Avril 49(Old man, here's one to send Sainte Beuve if he gives us a hard time!)--refers to literary historian and critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who was known for his conservative opinions. The wordsLes Debatsat the woman's elbow probably refer toLe Journal des Dbats,which published arts criticism.
Gustave Courbet, who had previously painted less than a handful of flower pictures, took up the genre enthusiastically during a stay in western France in 1862. Intending to visit his friend Etienne Baudry for two weeks, he arrived at the garden enthusiast's chteau in May and remained in the area for eleven months. With his friend's encouragement, Courbet explored flower painting using Baudry's extensive gardens, greenhouses, and library of botanical books. He painted about twenty flower pictures and remarked to a friend,  I am coining money out of flowers. Courbet had visited Holland in 1847 and his exposure there to Dutch flower painting is evident. His arrangement shares the exuberant spontaneity and abundance of Dutch artist Jan Van Huysum'sVase of Flowers.Like his Netherlandish forebears, Courbet chose flowers that bloom at different times of the year: lilies, roses, gladioli, stock, asters, ipomoeas, poppies, and others. While he typically eschewedallegory, Courbet may have also followed the Dutch practice of using ephemeral flowers to suggest the transitory nature of life and human happiness. Unlike Van Huysum and other Dutch painters known for their intricately detailed technique, Courbet used broad brushstrokes and often spread his thick paint with apaletteknife.
To create a living art, that is my aim.--Gustave CourbetThrough a dynamiccompositionand radical painting technique, Gustave Courbet emphasized the specific qualities of this primordial cave in his native region of the Jura Mountains in eastern France. Earthy hues and textures swirl around a tunnel-like entrance, drawing attention to the clear blue stream running through it. Two large boulders stand before the vortex, several feet from a wall hugged by delicate scaffolding. To mimic the cavern's craggy and colorful surfaces, Courbet usedpaletteknives to apply and scrape off paint and brushes to mix drying paint in with wet.Like many tourists and scientists of his day, Courbet was probably drawn to thegrottofor its geological interest. In the mid-1860s, he frequently painted caves as a means to explore composition and technique freely, and to demonstrate his strong belief that artistic subjects should be rooted in one's lived experience. He saw the basis ofRealismas  the denial of the ideal,  the rejection of establishedclassicalsubjects and a refined style. He chose instead, to paint only what he could see.
Guillaume Courtois chose to set the private scene of the threeMagibringing gifts to the babyJesusamidst excited onlookers. A typically variedBaroquecrowd surrounds the calm, carefully composed central figures. Betraying hisclassicizingorientation, Courtois seated the Virgin on a fluted column and drew a Doric one behind the stable.Courtois made this highly finished study for an engraving reproduced in a book printed in Rome in 1662. The missal book included engravings after drawings by leading contemporary painters working in Italy, mostly ofNew Testamentsubjects; copies are rare today. The indentations throughout the sheet indicate that someone used a stylus to trace the drawing before making the print.
And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised. (Matthew 27: 51-52)Choosing to represent the dramatic momentChristdied on the cross, Antoine Coypel used strong contours, thick, parallel hatching, and judicious applications of whiteheighteningto give this drawing power. His fluid white accents create the lightning implied in the biblical passage, providing a supernatural spotlight on the crosses and Christ's stricken followers.
Wearing the official academy costume--a brown velvet waistcoat, lace shirt, and long powdered wig--the French artist Charles-Antoine Coypel gracefully turns towards the viewer. When he made this half-length self-portrait, Coypel was forty years old and already a full professor at theAcadmie Royalein Paris.With an open-handed gesture, Coypel presents both himself and his work to the viewer. He stands against a portfolio containing colored paper; underneath, a silver holder contains sharpened pieces of chalk, the medium essential to his profession. Written on the portfolio is a dedication:  Charles Coypel has painted himself for Philippe Coypel, his brother and his best friend, 1734.  Coypel's younger brother was avalet de chambreto KingLouis XV, so the picture served also as a tool for self-promotion. Displayed in the Philippe's house, the self-portrait would have boldly presented the confident image of Charles to the powerful members of the king's inner circle.A brilliant portraitist, Coypel excelled in the medium ofpastel. He first drew a detailed underdrawing lightly in pencil, then made crisp outlines using a sharpened pastel crayon. The soft, harmonious coloring completes the work and conveys the differences in texture between his thick velvet waistcoat, the gossamer white lace, and the smooth and shiny buttons.
Upon seeing her motherCleopatrabeginning to collapse from poisoning, Rodugune starts up from her throne. Her troubled, histrionic expression recreates the high drama of Pierre Corneille's most successful tragedyRodugune,from which the dramatist and painter Charles-Antoine Coypel took this subject. Drawing from a live model who may have worn the full costume in his studio, Coypel concentrated on suggesting sudden movement and capturing the play of light on the princess's elaborate dress. He created the sense of a shimmering, luxurious fabric using his characteristic, soft handling of black and white chalk.Coypel made this drawing as apreliminary studyfor acartoonfor a tapestry to be woven by the Gobelins Manufactory. The squaring indicates that the design for this single figure was transferred to the largercompositionof the cartoon and to an oilmodello.
In an episode from the highly popular romance by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ofThe Story ofDon Quixoteseries, the tapestry designer copied the painter Charles-Antoine Coypel's image of Sancho, the companion of Don Quixote, in a palatial setting. Agiltchandelier fitted with burning candles hangs above, and a buffet set with ceremonial silver stands against the back wall. To the right, the bearded and bespectacled figure of the doctor points to the table with a long stick. On his orders, the pages bring various dishes and then whisk them away as he declares their contents detrimental to Sancho's health.Around the central scene, the tapestry also features an elaborate surrounding decoration known as thealentours.Amid the garlands of flowers and fruit, two hanging bronzemedallionscontain profiles of knights. Two monkeys also play in the long garlands on the right and left. The monkey on the right dangles a long lance in the direction of the three sheep below, who scatter. In the opposite corner amid a pile of books, a spotted spaniel points at the other monkey above. The title tapestry's title is woven in yellow thread in the bottom center.This tapestry was woven at Gobelins under the direction of Michel Audran and his son Jean Audran fils. Thealentourswere designed by Claude Audran III, Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay fils, Alexandre-Franois Desportes, and Valande.
The story ofDon Quixote, based on the highly popular romance novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, served as the basis for one of the Gobelins manufactory's most popular sets of tapestries, woven in nine separate series throughout the 1700s. Although the central scenes showing the escapades of Don Quixote and his companion Sancho remained the same, the surrounding decoration, known as thealentours,changed to reflect current fashions. The Getty Museum's tapestries come from the eighth weaving, which used the newly invented rose- and crimson-colored ground.The French kings often gave tapestries as diplomatic gifts. On August 20, 1786,Louis XVIpresented the Museum's tapestries to his sister-in-law, the duchess of Saxe-Teschen, and her husband the duke, the governors of the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). Unlike many surviving hangings from the 1700s, these four tapestries remain in superb condition. The colors of all four scenes have faded very little overall, and some colors are still strong, particularly the shades of purple in thealentours,which usually fade to gray upon exposure to light.The surrounds for these tapestries were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Franois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques. The tapestries were woven in Michel Audran's workshop, assisted by his son, Jean Audran, fils.
In an episode fromThe Story ofDon Quixote,based on the enormously popular romance novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Sancho, Don Quixote's companion, ceremoniously arrives on the island of Barataria and is carried along the paved street amid a group of citizens.All four tapestries from the Getty Museum's Don Quixote series feature a surrounding decoration known as thealentours.This elaborate frame represents a damask wall covering festooned with thick garlands of fruit and flowers. The picture frame rests on a base piled with armor, an axe, flags, and twocornucopiaspilling fruit. At the bottom the tapestry's title is woven in yellow thread.This tapestry was woven at Gobelins under the direction of Michel Audran and his son Jean Audran fils. Thealentourswere designed by Claude Audran III, Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay fils, Alexandre-Franois Desportes, and Valande.

The tapestry designer based his depiction of an episode from Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's enormously popular romance,The Story ofDon Quixote,on a painting by Charles-Antoine Coypel. He placed Don Quixote and his companion Sancho in a room furnished with a bed and two chairs. Don Quixote sleeps in one of the chairs, dreaming ofMinerva, goddess of wisdom, who approaches in a cloud with her left arm extended to dispel his madness. Sancho, standing next to his master, gazes in a trance at the figure of Folly, who carries in her right hand a model of a castle and in her left a pole with a fool's cap.Around the central scene, the tapestry also features an elaborate surrounding decoration known as thealentours.Amid the garlands of flowers and fruit, a monkey plays on each side. The monkey on the right dangles a long lance in the direction of the three sheep below, who scatter. In the opposite corner amid a pile of books, a spotted spaniel points at the other monkey above. The tapestry's title is woven in yellow thread in the bottom center.The surrounds for this tapestry were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Franois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques. It was woven in Michel Audran's workshop, assisted by his son, Jean Audran, fils.
The painted inscription on the side of one of these vases identifies the pair as  the first large-scale experiment [inporcelain] made on May 15, 1769 in the factory of Geminiano Cozzi in Cannaregio.  On the other side of the same vessel, threeputtihold up a large anchor, the mark of the Cozzi factory. These conspicuous references to the factory, owner, location, and date of production suggest that these works were produced as showpieces, possibly remaining with the factory to tempt future clients.The scenes on these vases celebrate the beauty, wealth, and sovereignty of the Venetian Republic. One vase displays the figure ofNeptuneholding histrident, complemented by a scene of an imaginary river town. Theallegoricalfigure of Venice with a recumbent lion decorates the other vase.
Esther approaches her husband King Ahasuerus, desperate to tell him of a plot to massacre the Jews. As Ahasuerus touches her with his golden scepter as a sign of his good favor, Esther faints with relief. Behind Esther, a crowd of courtiers, compressed into the dark background, watches in open-mouthed amazement at her daring.Frans Crabbe van Espleghem used complex patterns of hatching to create the various architectural and human forms. Busy lines of cross-hatching capture the shifting folds in Esther's dress. One of the first Netherlandish artists to experiment with the technique of etching on copper, Crabbe incised this fully worked preparatory drawing for transfer to a copper plate; the drawing corresponds almost exactly in scale to the finished etching.
In seventeenth-centuryFlanders, paintings of peasant scenes began to take on a new character, emphasizing carousing, drinking, and smoking. The central action of this painting is a variation on the theme of cardsharks made popular by Caravaggio. Josse van Craesbeeck'sCard Playersalso shows the influence of his friend and teacher Adriaen Brouwer, who also painted sordid tavern scenes.Craesbeeck presented peasants engaged in crude, dishonest, and vulgar activities. In this disreputable game of cards, the woman decides which card to play by examining her opponent's cards, which she sees in a mirror held up behind her opponent's back by her accomplice. At the right, another woman with a broken pipe at her feet drinks wine and smokes, while a man relieves himself against the wall. A seated child wearing a kind of turban plays on the floor. The woman with the straw hat and the bearded man, colored with great refinement, are characteristic types in Craesbeeck's repertory of figures. Possibly influenced by Caravaggio's followers, Craesbeeck paid careful attention to the effects of light, which streams into the room from a single window.
Lucas Cranach the Elder drew this lion with a quill pen cut to an extremely fine point. Using numerous delicate lines, he built up the long flowing mane, the smooth coat, and the tufted tail. This drawing provided the inspiration for the lion in a laterwoodcut, although Cranach changed the coat and mane to make them more shaggy and curly.Exotic animals such as lions, tigers, and elephants were extremely rare in Europe in the 1500s. Although members of the aristocracy kept some in private zoos or menageries, artists mainly had to rely on prints or stuffed examples if they wished to include an exotic beast in their works. It is thus unlikely that Cranach drew this lion from life, despite its lively, lopsided expression.
Lucas Cranach the Elder drew from both native German andclassicalliterary sources to depict a family offaunsin a woodland clearing. Although the precise subject of this painting remains obscure, it recalls the legendary  wild man  found in medieval mythology, as well as idyllic forest dwellers, such as fauns, described in Greek poetry.The male faun sits on a rock, staff in hand, with a slain lion at his feet. He gazes toward a woman--presumably his wife--and their children. Dark foliage mediates between them and a stunning landscape: a lake, a village, mountains, and a castle in the distance. Isolated and protected from civilization, these figures represent the wild traits of mankind. On the other hand, the faun's humanlike appearance, the woman's calm demeanor, and the baby's tender gesture suggest more civilized aspects of society.Aside from this broadernarrative, Cranach's finely worked style draws attention to incidental elements, such as the lion's fur and a man and a horse and cart climbing the castle-topped mountain. The lion's stylized body fits perfectly in the painting's lower left corner. Such attention to detail and Cranach's complex subject matter appealed to the refined tastes of his learned, courtlypatrons.
For this unidentified sitter's likeness, one of Lucas Cranach the Elder's many portraits, Cranach used a technique uncommon in Northern European drawing of the early 1500s: brush and oil paint on paper. The gleaming white highlights of the oil paint in the face contrast with the brown ground, making the sitter seem to emerge from the shadows and enhancing the illusion of his living presence; the young man's large, intelligent eyes further the effect. Cranach combined intensity of expression with jewel-like refinement of surfaces to create a memorable image.To produce the brownish ground, Cranach rubbed the paper with oil. He then sketched in the outlines of the head in pen and ink, meticulously going over the eyebrows, lashes, and outer facial contours. Next, using black chalk and brown oil paint, he sketched in the hat and collar. He continued by working up the face in oil paint, meticulously establishing the nuanced contours of the man's facial structure.
Lucas Cranach the Elder often painted carefully described animals, one of his particular specialties and a typical manifestation of Renaissance interest in nature. He frequently depicted stags, both as victims of the hunt and as onlookers. Here Cranach began with a sketch in black chalk, which he then went over rapidly with a brush and ink wash, using broad strokes to create the long, furry winter coat. He then freely applied varied washes to the legs and antlers.On the verso, a quickly brushed yet well-formed three-dimensional goat grazes energetically. The head of another goat is cut off by the edge of the paper, and a light black chalk sketch of a third peers outward above the neck of the main animal. All three animals stare saucily at the viewer with engagingly direct gazes.
 On many occasions I use the camera as a sketch pad. The endless variations on a theme such as the 'El' picture...were suggested with a 36 exposure roll of 35mm film,  Ralston Crawford described his working method in 1949, the year after this photograph was made. Although it is not certain that this photograph comes from the roll he discussed above, this print illustrates the approach he outlined. Crawford used ink lines and notations to crop the image on the print's surface, indicating the area that he would later incorporate into a painting. In this view of a painted steel support for the elevated railway, Crawford revealed his eye for detail and graphic contrast.
Viewed from below, the tracks of New York City's Third Avenue El possess an abstract rhythm that echoes the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. Introduced in New York during the 1870s, elevated railroads were a popular form of transit that made it possible for residents to commute quickly to work from areas once considered remote. While riding the El to and fro, passengers could enjoy the city views. In time, however, subways replaced the elevated trains, and passengers' attention shifted from the exterior landscape to the interior. The Third Avenue El closed in 1955, six years after Crawford made this photograph.
The bearded, elderlySaint Paul, dressed in a toga as an ancient Roman, sits with a pen in his right hand and an ink pot in his left. Pausing from writing his book, the Epistles, he looks up to heaven for divine inspiration and lifts up one foot to rest on a stone. The handle of a sword, one of his attributes visible on the right, symbolizes the manner in which he was executed as amartyr.Even as he sits in quiet contemplation, Saint Paul exudes strength. Giuseppe Maria Crespi's strong modeling of the saint's body and drapery gives him additional power. The artist crafted thecompositionwith bold lines of red chalk, and the cross-hatched lines of shadow accentuate the impression of a varied play of light over the monumental sculptural form.Crespi usually made less-finished drawings than this work, which leads scholars to guess that this drawing may have been intended as a design for an etching or engraving.
During the Black Death of 1348, the Blessed Bernard Tolomei left the safety of his Benedictine monastery in Monte Oliveto and returned to his native Siena to attend to the sick and dying. He succumbed to the plague that same year and soon became the object of religious devotion. An abbot from Bernard's monastic order commissioned this painting in 1736, when Bernard was being considered for sainthood. Giuseppe Maria Crespi interpreted the story's pathos with great depth, expression, and immediacy.Wearing a white robe and holding a crucifix, Bernard and a fellow monk attend to plague victims in an open-air encampment outside the walls of Siena. On the left, a priest walks under an umbrella, accompanied by an acolyte. Several plague-stricken figures languish on the ground in various stages of death. Below Bernard, a woman slumps over while her small child desperately tries to pull her upright. At her feet, the foreshortened body of a dead infant falls in the area between the acolyte and bowing monk. A woman has perished in the right corner, her gray-skinned body lifeless, thus a man above her holds a cloth over his mouth to avoid smelling the stench. Contorted, highlighted figures emerge from the shadowy darkness to confront the viewer, accordingly heightening the emotion of the drama.
Designed to hold logs,firedogsorchenetstake their name from the French word for a small dog. Pairs of firedogs were placed inside the fireplace, with their gilt bronze decoration concealing wrought iron bars that supported the burning wood.To earn money to pay fines and mounting debts, thebnisteCharles Cressent was forced to sell these firedogs, which he made, along with the contents of his house and workshop at auction in 1757. In the entry in the sale catalogue for number 163, he proudly described these pieces in the following words:[A pair of] firedogs which represent twosphinxes, one playing with a cat and the other with a monkey, mounted on two feet, of the grandest taste. Amateurs will remark that these sphinxes are not treated like those one usually finds on firedogs; these could be considered to be one of the finest treatments in France, garnished with their sculpted and gilded ornament.
Charles Cressent made both the wooden carcass and gilt-bronze mounts for this commode. His practice of casting bronze in his workshop broke strict guild rules; through the eighteenth century, the craft of casting and gilding bronze was restricted to a separate guild. Cressent was fined several times for these infringements; in order to pay the penalties, he was forced to hold sales of his stock. In a catalogue he wrote in 1756 for one such sale, he describes this commode's unique central gilt-bronze mount:  the bronzes [represent] two children who are grating snuff; in the middle is a monkey powdering itself with snuff. By the time it was built, this commode already looked old-fashioned. By the 1740s most commodes were constructed without a central divider that separated the two drawers. Although the curving gilt-bronze branches on the front try to mask this division, Cressent had to split the mount into three pieces--an awkward solution. He seems to have had difficulty selling the commode as it was still in his possession nearly twenty years after its construction.
Since the wooden interior of the gilt bronze case has been cut away to provide space for the swing of a pendulum, scholars know that this case originally held a clock movement. These alterations date to the 1930s, when the Duveen brothers, antiques dealers, converted it into a barometer to form a pair with a similar clock, now also in the Museum's collection.The cabinetmaker and sculptor Charles Cressent made the case. In the corner of the Getty Museum'spastelpainting by Maurice-Quentin de la Tour from around 1740 sits a similar model in the form of a clock standing on a cabinet.One of the most importantbnistesof the 1700s, Cressent originally trained as a sculptor and liked to design and make his own gilt bronzemounts. This practice, which broke strictguildregulations, brought large fines and forced him to hold several sales of his works. He had a roster of wealthypatronsbut his passion for collecting paintings kept him continually in debt. Cressent himself wrote a detailed description of a model for this barometer in an auction catalogue from 1757.
This wall clock design with an ornate gilt bronze case and bracket was popular in France; artisans produced such examples for nearly twenty years through the 1740s and 1750s. In the corner of the Getty Museum's pastel painting by Maurice-Quentin de la Tour from around 1740 sits a similar model in the form of a clock, on top of a cabinet. The Getty Museum's example can be dated to about 1758 because one of the movement's springs is inscribed with this date.Scholars believe that Charles Cressent, one of the greatestbnistesof the 1700s, designed the elaborate gilt bronze and enameled metal case of this clock. Stringent guild regulations prohibited Cressent from gilding and chasing this design himself as he was a cabinetmaker and not a member of the bronze caster's guild. However, by veneering the wooden sides of this clock with metal and then attaching the gilt bronze mounts on top, he could successfully avoid prosecution.
Seeming to emerge from the background and float in front of it, the Trinity shown in this illumination has an assertive presence. Crivelli created a visually dynamic painting by contrasting the manner of representation in the main figural group with that of the background. In contrast to the sculptural clarity of the Trinity, the golden angels' heads in the background are painted in such a manner that they are partially formed out of the expanse of blue and red space, making them spatially ambiguous and ethereal. The Trinity represents the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead according to Catholic belief. The Trinity is shown here as God the Father holding the Crucified Christ with the dove representing the Holy Spirit between the two. This initial probably comes from a choir book that contained the sung portions of the Mass, where it introduced a text used on Trinity Sunday.
This tiny, hand-heldmanuscriptwas the personalprayer bookof Andrea Gualengo and his wife, Orsina d'Este, who was a member of the ruling family of Ferrara, where this manuscript was made. A high-rankingcourtierat the Este court, Gualengo successfully negotiated an accord between the cities of Faenza and Ferrara. Probably in recognition of his diplomatic service, he was allowed to marry into the Este family. Thebook of hoursmay have been made in connection with Andrea and Orsina's wedding.The text of the manuscript comprises the standard readings found in books of hours, including theHours of the Virgin,Penitential Psalms, theHours of the Holy Cross, theOffice for the Dead, and Suffrages, which are prayers to saints. This last section contains the majority of the twenty-one full-pageminiaturesin the manuscript.Two artists working at the court of Ferrara painted the illuminations. Taddeo Crivelli was responsible for the majority of the miniatures, and another importantilluminator, Guglielmo Giraldi, contributed four of them. An example of theRenaissancestyle in northern Italy, the manuscript is rich in references toclassicalantiquity and employs a variety of dramatic illusionistic devices.
On a vibrant tile floor of alternating colors, theVirgin Marykneels within the deep receding space of the chapel. Suddenly she is interrupted at her daily devotions by the angel Gabriel, who announces that she will bear theMessiah. An abbreviated version of Gabriel's words, taken from Luke'sGospel, appears on the top of the frame inclassicalRoman letters:Ave gracia plena(Hail, full of grace).In contrast to the central image's use ofperspectiveto suggest the illusion of depth, the space of the border bursts out into the viewer's space with feats oftrompe l'oeilillusionism. Theputtoon the left, wrapped in a swirling scroll of music, pushes his right foot into the viewer's space while his wings overlap the outer frame. Naturalistic elements, including flowers, peacocks, and trees, crowd the border, interspersed withRenaissanceheraldicdeviceswith Gualengo's personal mottoes.Thisminiatureof theAnnunciationfaces the beginning of the text of the service ofMatinsin theHours of the Virgin.
Within an initialD,King David raises his hands in prayer and asks God to forgive him. A model of repentance for the reader of thisbook of hours, this image of David opens thePenitential Psalmssection.
An image of the cross marks the beginning of the service of the Hours of the Cross. The Crown of Thorns and two scourges, symbols of the torturesJesussuffered, hang on the cross as trophies of Christ's victory over death.
Inside an initialD, a skull sits on a green rock. A gruesome reminder of death, this image introduces the Office of the Dead. In addition to being an integral part of funeral services, devout Christians read this prayer service daily to prepare themselves spiritually for death.
TheprophetSaint John the Baptist, Jesus' cousin, wears a camel's hair shirt as a sign of his asceticism. A scroll above him reads:Ecce Agnus Dei Q[ui] T[ollis] P[eccata] M[undi](Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world).  John the Baptist is the first of more than twenty-five saints listed in the Suffrages, a section of prayers invoking the saints' aid.
Naked and vulnerable,Saint Sebastianstands in front of a tree. Arrows pierce his body, yet he prays undisturbed. According to legend, thisearly Christianmartyrwas killed by order of the Roman emperor Diocletian.
One of the most engagingminiaturesin the Suffrages features the Last Supper. Inside a marble Renaissance-style building, the apostles sit around a table withJesus.Saint John the Evangelistlays his head on the table, a reference to a passage in the Gospels where Jesus' best-lovedapostleis described as  leaning on Jesus' bosom. Most suffrages are prayers devoted to a specific saint; the prayer and miniature seen here are unusual for focusing on an event.
On the page facing a prayer dedicated to him,Saint Gregory the Greatsits before an altar and looks up toward the divine light entering the niche. The saint opens his mouth, singing. Theputtoon the left wrapped in a scroll with musical notes probably refers to Gregory's authorship of the devotional music known as Gregorian chant. Thisminiature, along with the majority of the figural decoration in thisbook of hours, appears in the section of the book devoted to the Suffrages.TheilluminatorTaddeo Crivelli displayed his facility with spatial effects in this miniature. The structure housing the saint is a fantastic creation ofclassicalarchitecture. Despite the apparent logic of the building, its base hovers in mid-air, overlapping the miniature's frame on the right. The putto tangled up in a scroll, the twisting blue banderole, the sharp, shimmering rays of gold in the border, and the energetic lines of the marble behind the saint's head give the painting a heightened emotional pitch.
The penitentSaint Jerome, who withdrew to the desert, kneels at the foot of a sculpted image ofChriston the cross. Although the viewer is meant to understand that Jerome prays before a sculpted crucifix, Jerome also appears to be present at the actualCrucifixion.In his cave lies a lion, the saint's attribute. Three books stand on the shelves, referring to Saint Jerome's scholarly endeavors.
Saint Nicholas,bishopof the 300s, holds in his hands the three gold balls with which he performed one of his legendary acts of charity. By providing dowries for the three daughters of a poor man, the saint saved the young women from lives of prostitution.
Saint Benedictreceives a vision of a radiant light and falls to his knees in prayer. In the right border, a hand emanating from clouds points to the upper right corner, the source of the vision. TypicalRenaissancemotifsborrowed from antiquity-a chubbyputto, garlands, and vases-fill the left border.
Saint Bernard holds an abbot's staff and wears the habit of theCistercianOrder. Known in the Middle Ages as the  honey-sweet teacher,  Saint Bernard was famous for encouraging emotional devotion to the human aspects ofChrist. His emotional approach deeply influenced the development of medieval spirituality.
In a small room,Saint Catherine of Alexandriareads and prays from a book on her lectern. Immersed in prayer, Catherine serves as a model of piety for the reader of this personal devotional book. Theminiatureappears before the prayers dedicated to Saint Catherine in the section of thebook of hourscontaining theSuffrages. Saint Catherine was particularly popular with women in the Middle Ages. An anchor and lilies in the right border may beemblemsof Orsina d'Este and her family, suggesting that thepatronwas particularly devoted to Saint Catherine.Catherine holds her attribute, the spiked wheel upon which she was tortured. The small statue of the Virgin and Child in a wall niche may refer to a miracle, when a statue of theChristChild came to life and gave Catherine the present of a ring, an event that came to be known as theMystical Marriageof Saint Catherine. The borders display a range ofmotifs, including a seahorse and the religious symbols of the pelican and dog.
Saint Dominicholds a spray of lilies, indicating his devotion to theVirgin Mary. His book alludes to his role as the founder of the order of preachers known as the Dominicans.
While angels carry her toward heaven, Mary Magdalene prays, naked save for the covering of her abundant hair. According toTheGolden Legend, a popular medieval compilation of saints' lives, the former sinner repented of her ways and retired to the wilderness outside of Marseilles in France after Jesus'Crucifixion. While living as a hermit there,  every day at the seven canonical hours she was carried aloft by angels and with her bodily ears heard the glorious chants of the celestial hosts. 
Saint PeterMartyr, a Dominican preacher and an inquisitor for the pope, displays the tools of his martyrdom: A dagger penetrates his chest, and a broad-bladed knife cleaves his skull. In this emblematic image, whose calm belies the violence of his death, Peter wears the habit of theDominican order.
The Franciscan friarSaint Anthony of Paduakneels in prayer while a mule bows down before a basket in front of him. Although the mule had been fasting for three days, the animal ignores the wheat in the basket and kneels respectfully before the consecrated Eucharist placed on top of the wheat. According to legend, this miracle took place in Toulouse.
The Franciscan Saint Bernardino stands in profile facing left. Behind him are two bishop's hats, alluding to his repeated refusal to accept that clerical office. In front of him is theIHSmonogram of Christ's name (derived from the Greek) surrounded by flamelike rays. At the end of a sermon, Bernardino would often display an image of this monogram.
In a simply framed miniature in this book of hours, Saint Bellinus, a little-known local saint, celebrates Mass before the kneeling Gualenghi-d'Este family. The saint, a twelfth-century bishop of Padua, clasps the outstretched arms of Andrea Gualengo while also gesturing toward heaven. Saints were believed to act as intermediaries between God and the faithful. Here Bellinus, long dead, appears before those who pray to him, bridging the gap between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries and between this world and the next.The patrons of this manuscript appear with two sons, probably from one of Orsina's previous marriages. Orsina was a member of the ruling Este family in Ferrara, and Andrea Gualengo came from a family of high-ranking advisors at the Este court and held important ambassadorial posts. Andrea and Orsina are attired in the richly decorated robes, tunics, capes, and gowns characteristic of Italian Renaissance courts. The intimate service takes place within the simple interior of a chapel, enriched only by the veined marble panels in the background and the coffered ceiling, standard details of the new Renaissance architectural style popular at the time.
As he prays upon his knees,Saint Francisreceives thestigmatafrom  a man like aseraphwith six wings.  His companion, Friar Leo, reading nearby, is unaware of the miraculous occurrence. The stigmata, the impress on his own body of the wounds thatJesusexperienced during hiscrucifixion, was one of the signs of Francis's holiness.
In the lastminiaturein the section ofSuffrages, Taddeo Crivelli paintedSaint Anthony Abbot, who withdrew to the Egyptian desert in the 300s. Dressed in the black robe of the Hospitallers' order, he appears with a small pig. TheHospitallers, founded in 1100 to aid the sick, took Saint Anthony as theirpatron saint. Given a papal dispensation that allowed their pigs to roam freely in medieval towns, the order took on the animal as itsemblem. Alone in his cave, the saint holds his prayer beads. This, along with his ecstatic facial expression, suggests that he is in the midst of fervent prayer. As in the other miniatures of the saints in thisbook of hours, Saint Anthony serves as a devotional model for themanuscript'sreaders, who are stimulated toward pious meditation as they read the prayer to him on the facing page.Crivelli set Anthony's peaked cave in a fantastic landscape that bears little resemblance to northern Africa, but the leafless trees and the barren ground do suggest a bleak wilderness. A winding stream connectsforegroundandbackground, and vivid pinks and oranges heighten the mystical spirituality of the scene.
Curtis's depiction of Navajos crossing the desert on horseback, their graceful silhouettes at the base of Arizona's Canyon de Chelly, betrays a romantic view of the past. As the western United States developed, Curtis endeavored to record the vanishing cultures of the land's original inhabitants. His work, which was sometimes choreographed and often printed in platinum--a luxurious medium associated with artistic movements of the day--combines documentary and aesthetic approaches.
Three Hopi girls, wrapped in heavy blankets and wearing the squash blossom hairstyle of maidens, sit and stand on an adobe rooftop, watching a pueblo dance below. A fourth girl is hidden behind the girl at right, with only a single twist of her hair visible over the standing girl's shoulder. The standing girl glances suspiciously at the photographer, Edward Curtis, who has invaded the girls' privacy with his camera's presence. In this photograph, the onlookers have themselves become an event to be witnessed.
Dance is an integral component of most cultures and very often serves as a form of religious, social, and artistic expression. The Pacific Northwest coast Kwakiutl tribe, shown here, were especially noted for their elaborate ceremonies, often involving dance.From 1896 until 1930, Edward Curtis engaged in a project to document Native American peoples. He made more than forty thousand negatives, most of which were glass plates. He published the resulting work in a series of twenty volumes titledThe North American Indian,the largest volume of which was devoted to the Kwaikutl and their customs.
The engravings of Franois de Cuvillis, one of the leading interpreters of theRococostyle in Southern Germany and an architect forMaximilian II Emanuel,Electorof Bavaria, influenced the design of this pair of ornately carved German commodes.Carved white  pearls  hang from the foreheads and the ears of the femalebustsadorning the corners, while scrolling leaves hang from the lower edge. The combination of white painted surfaces and gilded, pierced elements probably reflects the interior for which the commodes were originally designed. These commodes, with their sculptural elements in carved wood, differ from contemporary French pieces, which would have had applied gilt-bronze mounts for decoration.
A young milkmaid stares saucily over her shoulder, engaging the viewer with her direct gaze. As she squats on the ground, she holds a large container between her knees and easily squirts in the milk. Aelbert Cuyp focused on the milkmaid's youthful charm, using only a few lines to suggest the large body of the cow looming in the background. With a rich mixture of chalk and wash and making liberal use of the white paper, he emphasized the play of sunlight and shadow over the female form. The creases on her sleeves and skirt fold softly around her body, emphasizing her sturdy frame beneath.Cuyp probably made this drawing shortly before beginning a painting of the same subject. This work was so successful that Cuyp's students copied it several times.
A boat divides this panoramic river view, with the town of Dordrecht on the right, where the river Maas meets the sea, and the city of Zwijndrecht opposite. Although the painting looks as if it were painted at the scene, Aelbert Cuyp executed the canvas in his studio, using studies previously made outdoors. By employing an extreme horizontal format, he emphasized the flatness of the land under the wide expanse of sky. The low horizon opens out to a vast, cloud-laden sky, evoking the changeability of coastal weather. Cuyp included precise details that convey the particularities of the specific place portrayed: the boat's rigging and flag and the towns' windmills, houses, and churches.
Aelbert Cuyp was mesmerized by Holland's flatness. Using a long, narrow sheet of paper, he expressed vastness in breadth by compressing the landscape into thin strata that continue off the sides of the page. By choosing a low horizon line, he extended the openness to include a large area of blank, cloudless sky. He created aerialperspectiveand conveyed the sense of endlessness in depth by drawing the foreground in black chalk and the background in silvery graphite. This view seems miniaturized: buildings, boats, figures, and even grazing animals are indicated by dots of chalk in the middle distance, while similar, even more abbreviated markings create a distant background.Cuyp drew this scene in a sketchbook he made on his journey to southern Holland and northern Germany in 1651 and 1652, but the exact location remains unidentified.Theversocontinues the scene from a sheet in the Muse Cond in Chantilly, France. The scene depicts Cleves, in present-day Germany, with this part showing the Heideberger Mill and a portion of the city wall. A slight discrepancy in size between the two sheets indicates that one or both of the pages was cut down.
Christ appears in this initial as a youthful figure with round, rosy cheeks. He holds a book in his left hand and blesses with his right. The chant that follows is sung on the feast of the Epiphany--the day the three Magi visited the newborn Jesus. Depictions of Christ as an adolescent are relatively rare, and Epiphany chants are more often illustrated with scenes of the Adoration of the Magi. Here Christ appears in the guise of a young preacher who has already embraced the responsibilities of his adult life.
Christ's Apostles gather around the Virgin Mary in a tight circle, ready to receive the Holy Spirit, which descends in the form of a white dove from the figure of God the Father above. The entire scene takes place within an initial A, formed by the curved bodies of two dragons intertwined at their necks. Stefano da Verona's use of a lively palette of softly blended colors, and his delicate application of gold highlights to show details in the landscape, are hallmarks of his painting style.
King David exemplified mercy and self-restraint in preventing his companion Abishai from killing the sleeping King Saul (1 Samuel 26: 5-10). The simple, dramatic composition and statuesque main figures give this small, slightly eerie, moonlit scene a monumental quality. Yet the rhythm from the flowing movement and patterns of the garments enlivens the rocky desert setting and prevents the composition from being purely static.Richard Dadd's lightenedpalette, fascination with detail, and interest in decorative patterning typify mid-1800s English painting. For authenticity, Dadd selectedmotifsfrom Egyptian wallreliefs, Roman sculpture, his own memories, and possibly his own travel sketches of the desert and cliffs near the Dead Sea.To show this Old Testament subject, rarely seen in Victorian painting, Dadd mixed historical events, modern passions, and perhaps personal associations. After delusions led him to kill his father in 1843, he continued making art while confined to a mental hospital. Thinking that Dadd might cultivate David's moral virtues as an antidote to his own murderous compulsions, his doctor may even have suggested this subject.
Probably intended for a small chapel, this triptych shows the Virgin Mary in the center flanked by Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Paul. On the left panel Saint Thomas Aquinas wears the Dominican habit and holds a book of his writings. On the right panel, Saint Paul turns toward the Virgin and holds his symbol of martyrdom, the sword. In the center, the Virgin Mary wears a deep rich blue cloak made from ultramarine or lapis lazuli, a very precious and expensive pigment. A pattern of intricate marks called tooling, punched into the gold, defines the halo around her head. The background of the panels is covered with a thin layer of gold leaf, but the impression is of solid gold, meant to honor the holy figures depicted.As if she is extending into our space, the Virgin Mary reaches over the marble parapet with her right hand. This gesture symbolizes the holy Mother's power and mercy, and her unique position to serve for man as a compassionate link to God.During the 1500s, a reclining Christ Child was added in oil at the bottom, in front of the parapet. The child differed in style from the rest of the tempera painting. After the Museum acquired Bernardo Daddi's painting, conservators realized that the child was a later addition.
Three boats approach the German city of Cologne whereSaint Ursula, on her way back north after a pilgrimage to Rome, was martyred with the strike of an arrow. Ursula sits under a baldachin in the stern of theforegroundboat; two of her virgin companions reach out toward the shore. The middle boat carries Pope Ciriacus and his bishops. More of Ursula's attendants follow in the last boat. Banners depicting thearmsof Ursula and Ciriacus fly from the bow of each vessel.Originally forming the left wing of atriptychwith theCrucifixionin the center, this panel was made for the church of Santa Orsola in Florence. The subject, although common in Northern Europe, was rare in Tuscany. Daddi's treatment of the subject is also quite unusual. The panel is filled with surprising,naturalisticdetails like the frothing river produced by the oars and the boat's advancing prow.
Taking advantage of the medium's unsurpassed ability to capture spontaneity, Henri-Pierre Danloux caught the youth and vivacity of his young, unknown sitter with great freedom and expressiveness. Smiling with parted lips, the young woman exhibits her elegant profile and bright eyes. An exuberant, soft  mane of hair; a wide wreath of a stiffened, ruffled collar; and a lively striped sleeve and bodice surround her smooth, meticulously finished and delicately modeled face. An artfully disarrayed ribbon catches the rich black chalk curlicues of hair. Interspersed with the brilliant white paper, the softly modulated applications of graywashunderneath the hair and costume create a sense of glowing from within her young, clear skin.Danloux was as interested in capturing the young woman's inner world of thought and feeling as he was in representing her outward appearance. Her intense forward gaze hints at a strong personality. He may have made this portrait as one of a series of family portraits.
This small covered bowl, known as ancuelle, would have contained a serving of hot broth for a solitary diner or traveler. In the 1700s, it was difficult to serve food warm, since the kitchens were generally a long way from the dining room. The dish-cover or lid was a French innovation, invented to keep the contents hot while they were carried to the table or sat waiting for diners to arrive.It was not long before the decorative effect of the covers became as important as their function. Symmetrical arabesques and strapwork with profilemedallionsadorn the cast silver handles; these decorations emphasize, rather than obscure, the simple flat shape of the handles.
A silenos, or old satyr, a part-human, part-animal creature, reclines and plays the double flutes on this vase fragment. Companions of Dionysos, the god of wine, satyrs lived in a world of hedonistic pleasure. This silenos entertains himself by resting on a full wineskin. His white beard and tail, as well as the tufts of white hair covering his body, convey his advanced age. A small piece of a comic mask is visible just along the break on the upper left side of the fragment. This scene pokes fun at a popular contemporary scene on vases, that of Dionysos reclining on a couch at a banquet with a comic mask hanging in the background. Here the satyr mimics his master. This fragment comes from a squat lekythos, an oil vessel. The vase displays the lavish use of color favored by artists and their customers in the Greek colonies in Italy. This vase combines the red-figure technique used for the main design with the Gnathia technique of added color for the pattern work, a combination frequently used on small vases produced by the Workshop of the Darius Painter.
An astute observer of human nature and an often biting satirist, Honor Daumier here masterfully employed watercolor to illustrate the foibles of the French judicial system. Poverty forced Daumier to begin work at an early age; he once took a job as a messenger for the city's law courts, where he was exposed to the complexities and inequities of the legal system.  The strong, dramatic, diagonal of this composition focuses the viewer on the accused murderer. He leans over the dock to consult with his lawyer, who clearly controls the exchange, raising his right hand and seizing a sheaf of papers for reference. In contrast to the well-groomed and elegant lawyer, the criminal is wild-eyed and coarse. In the background a guard stands stiffly, oblivious to the exchange before him. In the gray courtroom, the empty space behind the guard suggests an air of anxiousness and uncertainty.
Known for his satirical, touching portrayals of contemporary life, Honor Daumier changed direction temporarily after seeing a newly hung collection of paintings by Jean-Honor Fragonard in the Muse du Louvre in 1869.Struck by the expressive power of Fragonard's rapid brushstroke, Daumier paid homage to his predecessor in a series of paintings that includedThe Studio. Daumier, who almost never portrayed beautiful women as objects of attraction, succumbed to Fragonard's sensuality and endowed this model with the upswept hair and casual off-the-shoulder costume of Fragonard's females. Emulating Fragonard's manner of sketching on canvas, Daumier made her dress shimmer, drawing with his brush to build the lights cascading from her blouse onto her full skirt.Aside from touches of gestural brushwork on the man's sleeve, the model's hair, and the woman's brilliantly illuminated skin and dress, this painting's darkerpaletteand largely subdued brushwork are consistent with Daumier's usual style. The artist hunched over his easel in the background also resembles his frequent depictions of painters or connoisseurs profoundly isolated by involvement with a work of art.
Capturing Greek legend's view of Paris and Helen as the perfection of beautiful manhood and the symbol of womanly beauty and sexual attraction, Jacques-Louis David painted the fabled pair of lovers at ease in their love nest. The subject is love, expressed by the presence ofCupidand the drawing's sensuality, rather than Paris's abduction of Helen or the Trojan War that ensued as a result.As early as 1786, the comte d'Artois, brother to kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, commissioned a painting on this subject from David. David worked on the painting for at least two years and completed it in 1788. In this drawing and others, he developed a serene composition with affectionate gestures and a lavishly furnished antique setting. The composition and emotional tone of the final painting remained very similar, though Cupid and the tall lamp were eliminated.
 Through his Brutus as through his Horatii, [Jacques-Louis] David talks to the people more directly and more clearly than all the inflammatory writers whom the regime has confiscated and burned,  wrote a contemporary about Jacques-Louis David's paintings. David made this study in preparation for the well-known painting completed in 1789, the year of theFrench Revolution. Although it created a republican political sensation at theSalon, he had almost certainly not intended that reaction. He had chosen the subject from Roman history to satisfy a commission from KingLouis XVI.After Brutus, founder of theRoman Republic, drove out the kings, he followed Roman code and condemned his own sons to death because they had supported the monarchy. Lictors, or Roman officers, bring in his sons' bodies for burial, while Brutus sits impassively in the shadow of the goddess Roma. In contrast, his brightly lit wife and daughters succumb to grief at the sight of the corpses. David aimed for absolute historical correctness in figures, furniture, and costume; this style and specifically this picture decisively influenced the Revolution's fashions, furniture, and hairstyles.
During theFrench Revolution, Jacques-Louis David was imprisoned twice for his support ofRobespierreand for signing arrest warrants while serving as a member of the Committee for Public Safety. While in prison, David made numerous portrait drawings of fellow prisoners, one of which is this drawing of Andr-Antoine Bernard, known as Bernard des Saintes, a lawyer who was eventually exiled for voting to executeLouis XVI.The portrait conveys the intensity of his subject's political beliefs. Bernard, who was forty-four at the time, poses stiffly in a high-backed chair with his arms folded resolutely across his chest. David captured the lawyer's forceful character in the determined set of his mouth, his fixed gaze, and his strong profile.
In one of the few commissions Jacques-Louis David accepted after he began working regularly forNapoleonin 1799, he agreed to paint a portrait of Suzanne Le Peletier when she was twenty-two years old. The portrait was painted the year of her engagement to her cousin Lon Le Peletier de Mortefontaine, whom she married in 1806. The painting's small size and intimate mood reflect its private nature. Suzanne is portrayed bust-length, facing the viewer. Her dark hair falls in loose curls around her forehead, accentuating her large, dark eyes. She is fashionably dressed in pale muslin with a soft, black cashmere stole around her neck. Suzanne Le Peletier became a national celebrity at the age of eleven after the murder of her father, theFrench revolutionaryMichel Le Peletier. Following his assassination, Suzanne was officially adopted by the French nation and given the title  daughter of the state. 
Fixing the viewer with a dreamy gaze, the fair-haired Telemachus grasps Eucharis's thigh with his right hand while holding his sword upright with the other. In the 1699 French novelLes Aventures de Tlmaque, loosely based on characters from the Odyssey, the author Fnelon describes how Telemachus, the son ofOdysseus, fell passionately in love with the beautifulnymphEucharis. His duty as a son, however, required that he end their romance and depart in search of his missing father.The ill-fated lovers say farewell in agrottoon Calypso's island. Facing towards us, Telemachus's blue tunic falls open to reveal his naked torso. Eucharis, seen in profile, encircles Telemachus's neck and gently rests her head upon his shoulder in resignation. In this way, Jacques-Louis David contrasts masculine rectitude with female emotion.David paintedThe Farewell of Telemachus and Eucharisduring his exile in Brussels. The use of saturated reds and blues contrasted with flesh-tones and combined with a clarity of line and form typifies theNeoclassicalstyle, which is characteristic of David's latehistory paintings.
The sisters Znade and Charlotte Bonaparte,Napoleon'snieces, embrace as they read a letter from their father, Joseph Bonaparte, who was exiled in the United States while they lived in Brussels, Belgium, after Napoleon's fall from power. The folds of the carefully creased paper are realistically rendered, and the viewer can even decipher a Philadelphia address on the letter.Jacques-Louis David juxtaposed the sisters' different personalities through their contrasting expressions and attire. The elder Znade appears worldly and elegant in a low-cut black velvet dress. Sitting upright, she looks frankly out at the viewer as she protects her younger sister, Charlotte. Charlotte appears timid and reticent as she shyly raises her eyes, and her dress, a modest gray-blue silk, suits her demeanor. The exiled princesses both wear tiaras and sit on a red velvet couch embroidered with golden bees, the Bonaparte familyemblem.
This austerebustof a young American woman by a French sculptor has an enigmatic air. The lack of accessories, the geometric simplicity of the shapes, and theclassicizingsquare form of the bust give the work an otherworldly effect. To augment this effect, the artist carved the face with smooth planes, left the pupils blank and unincised, and fashioned the large loops of hair on the top of her head in simple, clear shapes to bring out the figure's abstract qualities.The figure's remoteclassicismis leavened by thenaturalismof details such as her bumpy nose. Pierre-Jean David d'Angers captured the awkwardness of adolescence in his sitter, representing Mary Robinson as a shy teenager with her head demurely tilted forward and down, casting a deep shadow below her brows.Mary Robinson was the daughter of a merchant and sea captain with a route between New York and Le Havre, France. She probably sat for the sculptor on a family visit to France.
This striking photograph was part of Fred Holland Day's  Nubian  series of costume and figure studies of black males in 1897. The sitter's identity is unknown, and Day was clearly attempting to represent him not as an individual but rather as an ideal type.Photographed from slightly below eye-level, the  chief  casts a glance down at the viewer. Along with his open, assertive posture, his haughty, imperious gaze successfully conjures up a chief's commanding presence, even if the designation is fictional. The robe the sitter wears is North African; the pigeon-feather headdress, though it lends a strong pictorial effect, is not.The gently dappled light and soft tones of thegum bichromateprint render the sitter's boldly exposed, velvety skin as sensually as possible. Alfred Stieglitz reproduced the image as aphotogravurein hisCamera Notesin 1897.
Jean-Jacques de Boissieu carefully framed his motif: an abandoned fortified house in Lyon known as Chteau Gaillard. Viewed from below, the ruins loom over the landscape; two minute figures in the foreground heighten the castle's imposing presence. Bathed in clear light, the two women are paired with two equally tiny pots of flowers, small symbols of a tamed and cultivated natural world. But for the most part, nature cannot be contained. Foliage and trees spring forth from the craggy inclines and ruins. Nature and the man-made intermingle and are brought closer together by a shared palette of browns and greens.As a draftsman, Boissieu is best known for drawings like this one: large-scale landscapes enhanced with gray wash and highlights of gouache or watercolor. Boissieu masterfully adapted his brushwork to capture nature's distinct and varied textures in a complex pattern of strong shadows and bright light under an extremely light and cloudless sky. Toward the left edge of the image, tiny dabs of blue gouache deepen the shadows.
This is one of a series of twelve tapestries, which each showed an astrological sign for a month with a French royal palace in thebackground. The month of December shows the Chteau of Monceaux (demolished in 1799, during theFrench Revolution) through the bare trees. On the left,Louis XIVleads a hunting party with horsemen and hounds after a wild boar. In the center of the top border, the astrological sign of Capricorn hangs between garlands of winter fruit and vegetables. In theforeground, two liveried pages drape a rareNear Easterncarpet over thebalustrade, while a moorhen, crane, and bustard, birds from the royal menagerie, strut along the front.
In the central oval of this elaborate design for a ceiling, a loosely sketched couple wrestles among the clouds while other figures watch above them. Charles de la Fosse quickly sketched the central mythological scene but focused most of his attention on the surrounding decoration. Along the border and frame, he showed various options for ornamentalmotifsthat a patron could choose, such asputtiholding garlands or draped female figures, portraitmedallionsor rosettes, and scrolling. The decoration, once the ceiling was built, would have been symmetrical; this drawing allowed the artist to help the patron understand his or her choices.La Fosse used this drawing as a presentation piece for an unknown ceiling decoration project. Although the artist was one of the most fashionable decorative painters inParisin the late 1600s, most of the private houses and palaces he decorated no longer survive, so scholars do not know whether this design was ever completed.
Dressed in flowing robes of ocher and brilliant green, the monumental form of Christ dominates this leaf from a missal. The miniature prefaced the opening of the text for the Canon of the Mass, during which the priest prepares bread and wine for the Eucharist. The composition follows the traditional model for Christ in Majesty, with Christ seated on the arc of heaven and within a mandorla. He holds a chalice over which the host hovers, a reference to the celebration of the Eucharist. The stylized rays of light that emanate from Christ's form create a direct contrast to the subtle modeling of the folds of his robes and sensitively painted hands and face. The eagle, man, lion, and ox placed in the corners are symbols of the four evangelists, John, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, respectively. Each holds a scroll inscribed with the corresponding saint's name.This leaf is one of the finest paintings by Antoine de Lonhy, who was active in the Savoy region of France in the 1400s. The leaf that faced it in the original manuscript depicts the Crucifixion and is now in Prague.
Seen from behind, a man's arm curves possessively around the waist of his female companion. A refined woman dressed in fashionable seventeenth-century Dutch clothing walks down the aisle of the church with her greyhound in tow. In this interior scene, Anthonie de Lorme depicted the pulpit section of the middle nave of theLaurenskerk(Church ofSaint Lawrence) in Rotterdam. Warm sunlight floods the church and illuminates the soaring beauty of theGothicarchitecture. The clear, precise lines of thecompositionand the relative austerity of the setting were typical of DutchProtestantchurch interiors after the Council of Trent. In effect from 1545 to 1563, the Council aimed to reform the excesses of art in the Roman Catholic Church.The visitors seen here, dressed both in elegant clothes as well as peasant costumes, were probably painted by the Dutch artist Ludolf de Jongh, who was also active in Rotterdam at this time.
During the first decade of the 20th century, photographers such as De Meyer and Heinrich Khn helped advance the idea that photography should emulate other forms of art.Here De Meyer photographed several glass objects through a scrim. The thin woven fabric softens the backlit objects, replicating the subtle tonal effects prized in etchings by artists from Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn to James McNeill Whistler.
In 1925 Josephine Baker, an American dancer from Saint Louis, Missouri, made her debut on the Paris stage inLa Revue ngre(The Black Review) at the Thtre des Champs-Elyses, wearing nothing more than a skirt of feathers and performing herdanse sauvage(savage dance). She was an immediate sensation in Jazz-Age France, which celebrated her perceived exoticism, quite the opposite of the reception she had received dancing in American choruses. American expatriate novelist Ernest Hemingway called Baker  the most sensational woman anybody ever saw--or ever will. Baron Adolf de Meyer, a society and fashion photographer, took this playful portrait in the year of Baker's debut. Given the highly sexual nature of her stage persona, this portrait is charming and almost innocent; Baker's personality is suggested by her face rather than her famous body.
This rearing horse's two rear legs, upon which he balances his powerful bulk, serve as the sole support for the body of this large animal. Pawing the air and tilting his head to the left, the horse electrifies the space around him. The sculptor Adriaen de Vries further suggested the animal's vitality through the open mouth, flaring nostrils, and protruding veins on its belly. The horse's lack of shoes suggests that this is a stallion kept for stud.De Vries executed more than a dozen bronze statuettes of horses and horses with riders, only four of which survive or are securely identified. This is one of the rare signed ones. The horse's daring pose makes it atour de forceof bronze casting, and the beauty of its patina, or surface treatment, testifies to the artist's reputation as an exceptional bronzemaker.
At a crucial moment in an acrobatic juggling trick, this male figure holds one plate perched precariously on the fingertips of his right hand while another plate, held by centrifugal force, seems suspended. Further complicating the pose, the man looks at the ground and steps on a bellows. Dutch artist Adriaen de Vries based thecompositionof this bronze statue on a famousHellenisticmarble of a dancingfaun, which Michelangelo was believed to have restored while it was in the collection of theMediciin Florence. Although de Vries borrowed the original statue's composition, he replaced the faun's foot organ with a bellows and substituted plates for the faun's cymbals.This work of artistic virtuosity combines vitality and movement with balance. The strong S-curve on the figure's back demonstrates the complexity of his balancing act. The artist may also have had in mind the German wordkunststckemachen,which means both to juggle and, more literally, to make a work of art. The use of a verbal conceit such as this one and the exploration of a figure moving in space are characteristic of theBaroquestyle.
For four years, Saint Jerome retreated to the desert, where he purified his soul through physical suffering. The bearded saint sits in front of a barren and rocky background, his emaciated body a testament to his ascetic life. He directs his gaze to a crucifix that he holds in his left hand. During his time of religious contemplation, Saint Jerome was tormented by vivid hallucinations; his right hand clasps a rock with which he would beat his breast until the visions passed. A nook in the vaulted structure behind him holds his attributes: a cardinal's hat and a book referring to his translation of the Bible into Latin. A small lion inside the shelter recalls the fable in which Jerome pulls a thorn from a lion's paw, forever securing the animal's devotion. Ercole de'Roberti was artist to the court of Ferrara in northern Italy. The elongated forms, taut, linear rhythms, subtle colors, and meticulous, gold-flecked details of this painting convey the sophistication prized by Ercole's aristocratic patrons. This small devotional painting demands a focused concentration from the viewer that echoes Jerome's efforts to come closer to God.
Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, reclines on a fantastic goat-headed sea monster in this allegory of Lust. The goddess entwines her fingers in the creature's beard--a so-called  chin-chucking  gesture that represents erotic intent--while the monster licks her hand in response.Cupid, astride the monster's long tail, is poised to shoot an arrow at Venus, while in the background a putti adds to the amorous imagery by holding a flaming torch, undoubtedly meant to suggest the burning ardor of desire. The sea goat carries Venus through the frothy waves, carved with energy and precision.John Deare displayed his great skill in carving a variety of levels and textures in this sculpture, from the low relief of the Cupid and putti to the smooth, half-relief of Venus, and finally to the sea-goat's fully three-dimensional snout and wavy strands of hair. Deare's depiction of Lust as a woman riding a goat forms part of an iconographic tradition that has been popular since the Middle Ages.
This piece of mid-eighteenth-century furniture was meant to be used like a modern filing cabinet: papers were placed in leather-fronted cardboard boxes (now missing) that were fitted into the open shelves. A large table decorated in the same manner would have been placed in front for working with those papers. Access to thecartonnier's lower half can only be gained by the doors at the sides, because the table would have blocked the front.The painted black-and-gold decoration is commonly known asvernis Martin,named after the Martin brothers, Parisians who excelled at the craft of imitating Japaneselacquer. Their workshop probably also supplied the bronze Chinese figures flanking and surmounting above the clock.
In this self-portrait a young Edgar Degas turns his head to look out at the spectator. He wears casual clothes, including an open collar and broad brimmed hat. The informal, extreme close-up view of Degas's face and his impassive, almost sullen expression echo the unpretentiousness of his clothing. The small-scale, informal presentation and lightness of touch emphasize the intimacy of this image and the still-tentative character of the young artist.Around 1857, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four, Degas traveled to Italy, where he spent much of his time making copies afterRenaissancemasters. The period was one of self-education and he drew prolifically, writing in one of his notebooks,  I must thoroughly realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead.  Finding in himself a willing sitter, he made fifteen or more self-portraits in various media during his time in Italy.
Although the identity of the sitter in this portrait is a mystery, Edgar Degas conveyed her character by capturing the overwhelming sorrow to which she has succumbed. Posed with her head tilted and leaning against the back of her left hand, she appears weary. Her languorous expression and red-rimmed eyes, together with the limp right arm hanging at her side, suggest a physical or emotional malady, though nothing in the painting confirms the cause of her affliction. Hidden beneath a brown robe and full white gown, her pose is ambiguous; it is unclear if she sits, stands, or leans.The Convalescentattests to Degas's interest in the world of women--their physical characteristics and surroundings, and their complex emotional and psychological conditions.Unlike traditional nineteenth-century portraits, which were commissioned and usually left the artist's studio upon completion, this depiction of an unidentified woman remained in Degas's studio for at least fifteen years. The painting is unconventional in other ways as well;The Convalescentis more psychologically suggestive and spatially ambiguous than typical portraits of the time, such as Franz Xaver Winterhalter's official portrait,Leonilla, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn.Degas's thick, unblended brushstrokes and flattened space bring the figure forward, conveying informality and intimacy.
In 1877 Edgar Degas attended weekly soires at the home of his friend Ludovic Halvy, a writer of opera librettos and popular romances. At these gatherings, Degas drew portraits of his friends and made studies for his own work. He quickly filled this sketchbook with drawings that show his preoccupation with a variety of theatrical themes, including thecaf-concertand the ballet. When he completed the sketchbook, Degas presented it to his friend, who shared his passion for theater and music. Halvy later added inscriptions to many of the pages--a useful addition for scholars, as they distinguish Degas's contributions from those by other friends who occasionally drew in the book. Halvy inscribed the date1877and the wordsCroquis de Degas(Degas's Sketchbook) on the book's cover.During his lifetime, Degas filled thirty-eight sketchbooks, using them for a variety of purposes: recording the appearance of a work of art he admired or a person he observed, visualizing a fictional scene he had read, or experimenting with a new idea. For scholars, this important collection of reliably dated documents provides first-hand information on aspects of his working methods.
On the first page of Edgar Degas's sketchbook, Ludovic Halvy described the book in French:  All the drawings in this album are by Degas.  On the side, he added a qualification noting that there are two or three by Ernest Reyer the composer. At the right he signed the book himself:  Ludovic Halvy 1877 and the years following.  These inscriptions and those on the following pages allow scholars to accurately date the sketchbook to the year 1877.Degas filled many sketchbooks during his lifetime; this is one of his largest of the thirty-eight that are known. It was also completed in the shortest length of time--approximately one year.
In April 1877, the Impressionists' third group exhibition opened in Paris. Impressed by his friend Paul Czanne's painting on view there,Baigneurs au Repos, Edgar Degasmade two partial copies of it in his sketchbook. As his notebook was rather large and unwieldy, Degas probably sketched the painting from memory when he returned home, rather than in front of the actual scene.Degas focused on the standing bather from theforegroundof the painting, producing a rather quick, cruelcaricatureof her naked body. Her head is a simple circle, with two curved lines for eyes, a half circle for her nose, and a swirl of lines representing her tousled hair. Partially erasing her arms to set them at a sharper angle, the artist concentrated particularly on the body's unusual bent position, shown from the front and above.
Across two pages of his sketchbook, Edgar Degas drew the composer Ernest Reyer sitting at a long table among four washerwomen. The numerous gestures that revealed an individual's class and work fascinated Degas, and he focused on the laundresses' expressive faces and bodies. One woman rests her head on her hand, with a bottle and a half-empty glass beside her, her eyes closed either in exhaustion or an alcoholic stupor. The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing. Reyer's intense gaze contrasts sharply with the studied indifference of the object of his attention.At the top of the page, Degas set the stage for the scene:  For a long time, Reyer has been offering a third-floor box [the cheapest theater box] to a washerwoman.  On the right Reyer sheepishly offers a piece of paper to a washerwoman, who holds an iron close to her cheek in order to judge its heat. There may be a sexual inference in Reyer's offer, especially since washerwomen in the 1800s often turned to prostitution to supplement their low incomes.
Watching a procession through Paris's Left Bank in June 1877, Edgar Degas quickly sketched the various characters he saw that day. At the upper left, a hatless priest bends over to the right, while an elderly man with a turned-up collar looks down. Below them a young girl with a wreath in her hair holds a flag, and a man carries a bouquet of flowers. At the right, on a larger scale, a stout woman wearing a mobcap and a fringed shawl faces left. Various overlapping faces fill the corner behind her. In the center floats a man's head topped with a priest's hat--perhaps a self-portrait of the artist.Once when another artist invited him to go to a caf, Degas objected to traveling by horse-drawn cab, saying,  Personally, I don't like cabs. You don't see anyone. That's why I love to ride on the omnibus--you can look at people. We were created to look at one another, weren't we   For Degas, it was in the simple realities of everyday life that art could be found, not in dramatic tales from history and mythology.
An unknown man stares out to the left, drawn in a sharp profile that emphasizes his high-domed head and projecting beard. Edgar Degas first drew him with a much smaller head, then raised up his forehead and skull, giving the man a more substantial presence. Quick, parallel lines form the sitter's dark mustache, while softer, curving strokes create the paler wisps of his beard. Degas only lightly sketched in his subject's clothing, with merely a few lines to indicate the rounded collar of a dinner jacket and a black necktie.
In the 1800s, when people depended on gaslight to light their homes, many artists put down their brushes at dusk and spent the late afternoon and evening in the many cafs around Paris. They gathered around the marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived to entertain them. One evening Edgar Degas quickly sketched the caf singer Theresa singingLaChanson du Chien(The Song of the Dog), a catchy little tune in which she imitated a dog as part of her act.Caught in full song, Theresa lifts her gloved hands to imitate the forlorn begging of a dog. Degas's quick pencil lines capture the fleshy width of her arms and chest, the ruffled edge of her low-cut gown, and her simple, upswept hair. With her open mouth and tilted head, she almost seems to be howling. A grotesquecaricaturein the upper right corner gives a crueler impression of the singer, with a gaping, toothy mouth, wrinkled eyes, and protruding nose.
Edgar Degas experimented by showing the robust curves of caf singers from various angles. On the left, a popular singer named Mademoiselle Dumay reaches down to an invisible audience, while a cluster of gaslights surrounds her head like ahalo. In the center, the stout body of a singer is seen from behind. Single lines suggest her wide chest and broad hips and the curling ringlets in her hair. A deliberately cruelcaricaturefills the right side of the sheet. Hair lifted into a rounded cone, she leans forward, gesturing with her hands. The rounded curves of her back and bustle echo the upward sweep of her hair.Degas was fascinated by the play of light over forms and generally chose to show the figures in his works under artificial rather than natural light. The glowing globes behind the head of Mademoiselle Dumay emphasize the whiteness of her face and her dark hair. Degas smudged the charcoal around her breasts and arms to suggest darker areas of shadow. He also used lines of parallel hatching around the singer to give the impression of greater depth to her body. The artist used this single figure as the basis for apasteldrawing,Mlle Dumay, Chanteuse.
Edgar Degas frequently used his sketchbook to work out new ideas for various paintings or lithographs. In this group of five quick sketches, he concentrated on the gestures and expressions of a singer at acaf-concert, several of which he later re-used. In the upper left corner, the caf singer who leans forward, her mouth open in full song, closely resembles apasteland lithograph known asMlle Bcat aux Ambassadeurs.At the lower left, Degas showed another vocalist in profile, reaching out towards an imaginary audience with both her arm and body. This figure appears again in the pastelLe Caf Concert des Ambassadeurs.The back of both another singer and a man with a high collar fill the upper right corner, while a woman bows in the lower right corner. A contemporary once described Degas as  an artist of rare intelligence, preoccupied with ideas which seemed strange to the majority of his fellows. Taking advantage of the fact that there was no method and transition in his brain, which was active and always boiling over, they called him the inventor of socialchiaroscuro. 
Edgar Degas frequently used his notebooks to record a performance he had attended or a person he had observed. Here he quickly produced three sketches of singers at acaf-concert. On the left one singer leans forward, with her face drawn in sharp profile. The raised dome of her upswept hair seems to echo the arching line of her back. The broad shoulders andbustof the singer Mademoiselle Dumay, drawn from two angles, fill the other half of the page. Degas created his figures using swift, abrupt strokes, as if he was impatient to record a posture or expression without sacrificing speed or spontaneity. Areas of definition are reduced to a few slashing lines: a zigzagging pencil forms the ruffled edge of the singer's bodice and small circles create curling ringlets in her hair.
Focusing on the performer's expression and gestures, Edgar Degas quickly captured a caf singer absorbed in her song. Two black lines form her closed eyes, a small oval serves as her nose, and a circle is her mouth. With a quick flurry of strokes, her dress puddles around her feet, while an irregular zigzagging line forms the ruffled edge of her bodice. On the right, another singer makes a deep curtsy toward the upturned face of a male spectator.As a youth, Degas was instructed by his teacher Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres to  use lines, young man, many lines, both to remember as well as to copy nature.  Quick sketches such as these two were vital tools for the artist to record a specific performance he attended or person he had observed as he prepared for a more elaborate painting or print.
In the 1870s Edgar Degas became fascinated with ballet dancers, paying frequent visits to the classes where the Opra's ballet master trained groups of young girls, the so-calledpetits rats. Here seven young dancers fill the page with theirplis, lunges, and kicks. Often Degas did not even bother to sketch their heads, focusing instead on their bodies' contortions and their outstretched arms and legs. A flurry of lines captures their fluttering skirts and short, pulled-back hair.The writer Edmond de Goncourt wrote in his journal in 1873:Yesterday I spent the afternoon in the studio of a painter named Degas. After many attempts, many bearings being taken in every direction, he has fallen in love with the modern and, in the modern, he has cast his choice upon laundresses and dancers. . . . And right before us, seized upon the spot, is the graceful twisting of movements and gestures of the little monkey-girls. . . . He is the man I have seen up to now who has best captured, in reproducing modern life, the soul of this life.
Always captivated by gesture and motion, in the 1870s Edgar Degas became interested in ballet dancers and particularly in the youngest ballerinas of thecorps. During frequent visits to Paris's ballet school, he found what interested him most: movement--not free and spontaneous action but precise exercises. On this crowded sheet, one dancer practices at the bar in the upper left with her back toward the viewer, while two others with legs extended lean over on the right. It was the studied position of each girl's legs that fascinated the artist; he often did not even bother to finish the top half of the body. In the bottom right corner, he quickly sketched a group of four dancers, their heads together in deep discussion, with the observant head of the ballet master just visible behind them.Using quick, even careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures with abrupt lines as if he was impatient to record each woman's posture or hand movement in the most emphatic terms without sacrificing swiftness or spontaneity. He wasted no time to give depth to the forms with unnecessary shading or hatching; the finger he dragged over the tutu of the dancer at the top left created a smudgy shadow that simply suggests the garment's fabric.
Stretching across two pages of his notebook, Edgar Degas sketched the interior of a brothel. While one soldier leans back in a drunken stupor, his head against the wall and legs extended, another soldier leans forward in deep discussion with a prostitute at another table. The establishment's madam watches the scene closely from a doorway on the right. Even in this quickly sketched scene, Degas draws the viewer into the drama by creating shrewdly observed characters. Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877. It tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire. She later falls in love with a soldier and murders him.
Expressions and gestures fascinated Edgar Degas, and he used both to focus on the relationship between a madam and a soldier in this brothel scene. Although only carelessly sketching, he still managed to give the episode an air of relaxed camaraderie. The woman gestures casually, lifting the edge of her skirt as she speaks. The soldier leans back easily in his chair with his arms wrapped around his knees, swinging his legs like a young boy.Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention. In the same year, Degas sketched several drawings based on its events in his notebook. The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire. She later falls in love with a soldier and murders him in a rage.
Leaning over a prostitute, an officer slyly slips his hand over her right shoulder. The prostitute's deep absorption in her card game contrasts sharply with the soldier's furtive glance. Does he gaze at her cards or down the back or the front of her loose dress  With careless strokes, Edgar Degas quickly defined the woman's fleshy body and the man's broad form. Fascinated by the numerous gestures that reveal social class and sentiment, Degas focused his art on situations that only genre painters had fully used before, such as the class tensions between a man and a woman or the undercurrent of violence and domination in an affair.Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention. In the same year, Degas sketched several drawings based on its events in his notebook. The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire. She later falls in love with a soldier and murders him in a rage.
A large, untidy woman reclines on a long bench, holding a glass in one hand. The mirror behind her reflects the back of her tousled head. Only the head and shoulders of her companion are visible as he gazes deeply into her eyes from the side of the scene. In this sharpcaricatureof a prostitute and her soldier, Edgar Degas captured with a few quick strokes the whore's deep appraising look as she sizes up her client. A few impatient lines characterize the broad, fleshy width of her shoulders and arms, the edge of her exposed breast, and her wrinkled dress. Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention. In the same year Degas sketched several drawings based on its events in his notebook. The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire. She falls in love with a soldier but finally murders him in a rage.
When Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877, the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute quickly caught Edgar Degas's attention. Months later, he sketched several scenes from the book in his notebook, focusing on the episodes when the prostitute is with her soldier lover. Here the drunken pair have fallen asleep at a table with an empty wine bottle between them. Using hasty, seemingly careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures and their surroundings with a few slashing lines. The woman's slumped posture and her companion's open-mouthed sleep are both recorded in the most emphatic terms, without sacrificing either swiftness or spontaneity. Simply by smudging the pencil lines with his finger, Degas also created darker accents such as the shadows under the table, the crease of the prostitute's shoulder blades, and her black hair. This effect dissolves the body's contours and emphasizes the woman's dark form in contrast to the soldier's pale, empty figure in the background.
In the 1800s, when people depended on gaslight to light their homes, many artists put down their brushes at dusk and spent the late afternoon and evening in the many cafs around Paris. They gathered around marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived later to entertain them. One evening Edgar Degas quickly drew three sketches of a caf singer. At the left she crosses her arms at her waist, her head and legs left incomplete. In the center she bows to the right, grasping her skirt with her gloved hand; on the right she gestures at an invisible audience.Degas's quick pencil lines captured the fleshy width of her arms and chest and her simple upswept hair. Only a single zigzagging line forms the ruffled edge of her low-cut gown. Using swift, interrupted strokes, he only bothered to outline the figures, as if impatient to record each of the postures and gestures.
Edgar Degas frequently used his notebooks to record a performance he attended or a person he had observed. Here he quickly produced two sketches of singers at acaf-concert. On the left one singer leans forward with her face drawn in sharp profile and her right arm extended. The crooning figure of another singer, her hair flowing behind and her arms reaching out in a pleading gesture, fills the other half of the page. Degas created his figures using swift, abrupt strokes, as if he was impatient to record a posture or expression without sacrificing speed or spontaneity. Areas of definition were reduced to a few slashing lines: a zigzagging pencil line forms the ruffled edge of the singer's bodice, and small wavy lines simulate ringlets at the back of the head.
The writer Edmond de Goncourt wrote in his journal in 1873:  Yesterday I spent the afternoon in the studio of a painter named Degas. After many attempts, many bearings being taken in every direction, he has fallen in love with the modern and, in the modern, he has cast his choice upon laundresses and dancers. In the 1870s Edgar Degas became fascinated with ballet dancers, paying frequent visits to the classes where the Opra's ballet master, Perrot, trained groups of young girls. He used these excursions to work out new ideas for various paintings or lithographs or to rework ideas that he had used before. In this group of three quick sketches, Degas concentrated on the gestures and expressions of the ballet master and his pupil, several of which he later re-used. At the left Perrot directs the dancers as he does in a painting known asRptition de Ballet(Ballet Practice). In the center, a tall dancer faces left with her head bent forward. Perrot appears again on the right in the same position as in two earlier paintings,Classe de Danse(Dance Class) andExamen de Danse(Dance Exam).
In a quick sketch of a rehearsing singer, Edgar Degas managed to give the scene an air of comic menace, suggesting a slight undercurrent of tension by both the placement on the page and the figures' specific gestures. Towering over the much smaller male figure, the singer fills the center of the page as she advances forward, eyes focused on her prey, who is pushed into the corner of the page. Slumped deep into his armchair, the man's position could suggest either complete relaxation or abject fear; his head tilts back, his arms grip the armrests of the chair, and his legs sprawl out in front.Degas was fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed his subjects' social class and work. He made art from modern subjects that only genre painters had fully used before: the tension between a man and a woman and the suggestion of violence and domination in a relationship.
Peering through an open doorway with her back to the viewer, a prostitute stands looking into the room beyond. With a few hasty strokes, Edgar Degas suggested the scantily clad figure, robed only in a flimsy chemise with bedraggled bows on her shoulders and slippers and a dark ribbon holding her hair, the ends of which hang down her back. Three vertical lines representing the doorframe and open door effectively frame the simple, evocative scene. Scholars believe the drawing is based on a scene from the novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), which tells the story of a girl who became a prostitute.The simple realities of everyday life captured the artist's interest, revealing his gift for expression in every line. When another artist invited him to go to a caf, Degas objected to traveling by horse-drawn cab, saying,  Personally, I don't like cabs. You don't see anyone. That's why I love to ride on the omnibus-you can look at people. We were created to look at one another, weren't we  
Edgar Degas spent many evenings at the homes of friends, discussing ideas with fellow artists, philosophers, and authors. Over two pages of his sketchbook, he drew asoirein the home of Madame Charles Hayem, who reclines on the sofa, coquettishly holding a fan to her face. The writer Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly stands before a fireplace in the center; seated on a stool with his back to the viewer is the philosopher Adolphe Francke. To the right of Barbey, Degas began to sketch a fourth figure with long, straight hair and perhaps a beard. On the far left, he experimented with another drawing of Barbey facing to the right in a long embroidered coat, holding a sword. Degas extensively erased and reworked the sketch as he experimented with different coat lengths and angles for the sword.
Seemingly absorbed in the opera below, a woman holding opera glasses gazes down from her box while a man kisses her shoulder. In an adjacent box, men enviously observe the performance beside them, rather than the one below. Although Edgar Degas drew each figure quickly, focusing on their facial expressions and gestures, he easily captured the various emotions of lust, jealousy, and boredom that fill the scene. He drew the couple on the left with close attention to particulars, detailing the man's dinner jacket and the woman's ruffled top, her beaded necklace, and the buttons on her gloves. In contrast, the six men in the box beyond appear as a varied crowd of heads, with only the barest suggestion of their shoulders. One of Degas's contemporaries once described him as  an artist of rare intelligence, preoccupied with ideas, which seemed strange to the majority of his fellows. Taking advantage of the fact that there was no method or transition in his brain, which was active and always boiling over, they called him the inventor of socialchiaroscuro. 
Edgar Degas used his notebook not only to record a work of art that he admired, a performance he had attended, or a person he observed but also as a place to experiment with ideas. Here he began a sketch of a man's profile with a long, feathery moustache. He was either disrupted, however, or he became quickly dissatisfied with the idea, as he never finished the scene.
With a swirling cloud of pencil lines, Edgar Degas sketched the artist Ludovic Lepic seated in the front row of a theater. Degas merely suggested the backs of the seats, concentrating on his friend's relaxed position and focused gaze. Still wearing his long overcoat over his dinner jacket, Lepic has thrust his hands deep into his pockets and rests his feet on the edge of the stage in front of him, his sunken eyes fixed on the performance ahead.Concentrating first on producing a shrewdcaricatureof Lepic, Degas did not bother to erase surplus lines to create a neat image. Instead, he drew with increasing strength on top of his early strokes until he discovered a form he liked. For example, he redrew Lepic's left shoe several times as he experimented to find the correct angle. In contrast, Lepic's face was hastily but assuredly drawn and needed no corrections. Quick, hatched lines form the man's thinning hair and beard, and one stroke delineates both his rounded nose and eyebrow.
Visits to the opera, ballet, andcaf-concertsprovided Edgar Degas with entertainment as well as a fertile source of subjects to draw. Here, a large smiling man holds his opera glasses in one hand while over his shoulder peers the composer Ernest Reyer, with a bowed head and a sad expression.Degas outlined the figures using swift, broken lines, reducing the men's suits to a few slashing strokes. He drew over his mistakes, without taking time to erase the end of the sleeve that was started too high or the man's sloping chin that did not project enough at first. Postures and gestures were impatiently recorded in the most emphatic terms, without sacrificing spontaneity. The darker accents of the man's mustache and collar provide deep highlights to the otherwise pale and evenly toned work.
As part of a sketchbook that served a purely private function, some of the pages combine an interesting variety of complex sketches and simple doodles. Edgar Degas never developed the geometric figures on this page into anything of significance.
As part of a sketchbook that served a purely private, practical function, some pages contain unfinished thoughts. Edgar Degas used his sketchbook pages to swiftly record a gesture or expression as well as the beginnings of an idea. Here he began a simple doodle showing a plant on a table and a mirror behind it on the left, with the corner of a room and a cage-like structure visible at the left.
During the year that he took to fill this sketchbook, Edgar Degas became fascinated with the singers who gave concerts in the cafs that he visited, filling numerous pages with images of them. Here he experimented by showing the robust curves of different caf singers from various angles. On the left one singer gestures emotionally. Hastily drawn parallel lines suggest the folds of her dress as it puddles on the floor around her feet and bunches at her hips. The singer on the right opens her mouth in full song. A smudge across her face casts it into shadow and makes the rest of her body appear in brilliantrelief.
In the evening, after dinner with his friends, Edgar Degas would often pull out his sketchbook to draw. He also passed it around, allowing others to make quickcaricatureson its pages. On this sheet, the composer Ernest Reyer seems to have contributed two of the three portraits. Reyer was a friend of Degas, and he appears himself in other drawings in this book. On the left is the profile of the composer Ernest Guiraud, probably by Reyer, with the wordWhistinscribed below it. Ludovic Halvy added the inscriptionE. Guiraud par [Ernest] Reyer(E. Guiraud by Reyer). Another carefully drawn head, probably also by Reyer, occupies the center, drawn when the sheet was vertical. Underneath this figure Halvy wroteL. Halvy  par Reyer.The paler sketch at the right, probably by Degas, is of an unidentified man..
After dinner with his friends, Edgar Degas would often pull out his sketchbook to draw. He also passed it around, allowing others to make quickcaricatureson its pages. On this sheet, the composer Ernest Reyer seems to have turned the tables, making the artist himself the subject in his own book. Reyer was a friend of Degas, and he himself appears in other drawings in this book. Ludovic Halvy added the inscription at the bottom:Degas par [Ernest] Reyer(Degas by Reyer).
In the 1800s, when people depended on gaslight to light their homes, many artists put down their brushes at dusk and spent the late afternoon and evening in the many cafs around Paris. They gathered around marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived to entertain them. Edgar Degas quickly sketched two caf singers with sharply pointed noses and haughty profiles, bowing magnanimously to their invisible audiences. A quick flurry of strokes creates the billowing fabric of their dresses, and a circle suggests the unfinished upswept hair of the left singer. Why do you paint women so ugly, Monsieur Degas   one hostess unwisely asked the artist.  Because, madam, women in general are ugly,  he growled. Such a remark was more an example of Degas's famously quick temper than of his actual beliefs. Nonetheless, he never missed an opportunity to produce sharpcaricaturesof either friends or strangers.
With her legs open and outstretched, a prostitute relaxes in a large, comfortable armchair. She wears only a thin neglige tied with ribbons on the shoulders, small slippers, and a black ribbon tied provocatively around her neck. Her loose hair hangs around her shoulders as she leans her head on the back of the chair and surveys the scene through half-closed lids. At the upper left, Edgar Degas began but never completed another sketch of her face.Degas used quick, abrupt strokes to capture the flowing fabric that covers the armchair and falls in gathers on the floor. The folds of the woman's gown emphasize the lines of her body beneath. Glimpses of her knees and the shape of her legs show through the thin fabric.Scholars believe that Degas may have based this sketch on a scene from Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa). The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire.
Focusing on the performer's expression and gestures from several angles, Edgar Degas quickly captured several caf singers absorbed in their songs. At the left, one faces to the left, with just the triangular tip of her nose visible from behind. At the bottom, one stands with joined hands. Two black lines form her closed eyes, a curved line her nose, and another makes her mouth. Another singer behind opens her mouth in full song as she gestures with one extended hand. Two other lightly sketched figures on the right face right. At the upper left, a carefully shaded sketch of a woman's head with downcast eyes is probably by another hand. Degas often passed around his sketchbook to allow others to contribute to it.In Degas's youth, his teacher Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres instructed him to  use lines, young man, many lines, both to remember as well as to copy nature.  Quick sketches such as these two were vital tools for the artist to record a specific performance he attended or person he had observed as he prepared for a more elaborate painting or print.
Fascinated by the women who entertained nightly incaf-concerts, Edgar Degas filled many pages of his sketchbook with quick sketches of them. Here three rapid drawings cover one side of the sheet. From top to bottom, Degas experimented with drawing a singer's profile, head, and upper body holding a fan. At the top, another sketch of a face has been begun and then abandoned.
Edgar Degas quickly sketched three rather cruelcaricatureson one side of the sheet and then turned his sketchbook upside down to fill the other side of the page. At the upper right he drew a caricature of a soldier in a field marshal's uniform, sporting a pig-like snout and a walrus mustache. Below are two caricatures of a man with a narrow, waxed mustache and a goatee, perhaps the former Frenchemperor Napoleon IIIor Degas's friend, the author Edmond de Goncourt.When the sheet is inverted, five more heads can be distinguished on the right. In the center of the page, thebustof a priest with long straight hair and arms folded against his chest faces left. Around the side of the sheet are four heads in profile, with either long, luxuriant hair or curling mustaches. The head in the top right corner is probably a portrait of Degas's friend, the author Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, who appears elsewhere in the sketchbook1
Across two pages of his sketchbook, Edgar Degas drew the composer Ernest Reyer sitting at a long table among four washerwomen. The numerous gestures that revealed an individual's class and work fascinated Degas, and he focused on the laundresses' expressive faces and bodies. One woman rests her head on her hand, with a bottle and a half-empty glass beside her, her eyes closed either in exhaustion or an alcoholic stupor. The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing. Reyer's intense gaze contrasts sharply with the studied indifference of the object of his attention.At the top of this page, Degas set the stage for the scene:  For a long time, Reyer has been offering a third-floor box [the cheapest theater box] to a washerwoman.  On the right Reyer sheepishly offers a piece of paper to a washerwoman, who holds an iron close to her cheek in order to judge its heat. There may be a sexual inference in Reyer's offer, especially since washerwomen in the 1800s often turned to prostitution to supplement their low incomes.

Edgar Degas sketched the interior of a brothel stretched across two pages of his notebook. While one soldier leans back in a drunken stupor with his head against the wall and legs extended, another soldier leans forward in deep discussion with a prostitute at another table. The establishment's madam observes the scene closely from a doorway on the right.Even in this quickly sketched scene, Degas drew the viewer into the drama by creating shrewdly observed characters. Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877. It tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire. She later falls in love with a soldier and murders him.

Edgar Degas spent many evenings at the homes of friends, discussing ideas with fellow artists, philosophers, and authors. Over two pages of his sketchbook, he drew asoirein the home of Madame Charles Hayem, who reclines on a sofa, coquettishly holding a fan to her face. The writer Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly stands before a fireplace in the center; seated on a stool with his back to the viewer is the philosopher Adolphe Francke. To the right of Barbey, Degas began to sketch a fourth figure with long, straight hair and perhaps a beard. On the far left, he experimented with another drawing of Barbey facing to the right in a long embroidered coat, holding a sword. Degas extensively erased and reworked the sketch as he experimented with different coat lengths and angles for the sword.

Edgar Degas captured the circus performer Miss Lala in her most thrilling act: Clenching a bit between her teeth, she was hoisted slowly to the circus rafters. Her strength and concentration are conveyed by the diagonal sweep formed by her outstretched arms. The gestural strokes surrounding her body echo this diagonal. Degas's colorpaletteheightens the dramatic effect; shades of electric blue contrast powerfully with Miss Lala's brown skin punctuated by a shock of black hair.Miss Lala performed her feats of strength and agility at the Fernando Circus, which opened in northern Paris in 1875. The Circus was a popular destination for artists. In addition to Degas--who lived nearby--Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Georges Seurat, each attended and painted the Circus. Degas was especially captivated by Miss Lala's arresting act and sketched her on successive nights in January 1879. This important study inpastelis one of several preparatory drawings that culminated in the artist's celebrated oil painting of Miss Lala's performance now in theNational Gallery, London. The pastel also reveals Degas's working process. For example, numerous pentimenti--especially in the thighs and right hand--show that Degas made adjustments to Miss Lala's pose on paper as she dangled above him.
A young ballet dancer bends forward to massage her foot, while her somberly dressed older companion sits silently beside her on a bench. They appear to be waiting, perhaps for an audition or its outcome. The two figures are a study in contrasts: The athletic dancer dressed in a dazzling costume reflects the glamour and artifice of the stage, while the shabbily dressed, bent figure represents the drabness of everyday life.Edgar Degas painted modern life; his subjects, including laundresses, milliners, nightclub singers, horse races, and the ballet, reflected contemporary Parisian occupations and diversions. From the 1860s onward, Degas frequented the Paris Opra, where he made numerous studies of performances, rehearsals, and backstage scenes. Later, he would refine and combine thesemotifsin his studio, in exercises of daring technical skill and compelling psychological subtlety. Here he demonstrated his complete mastery of thepasteltechnique. Delicately blended strokes are combined with bold hatching and emphatic slashes; pink, blue, and creamy tones describe the dancer in contrast to the dark, severe form of the older woman.
Two milliners sit at a dramatically angled worktable, their bodies partly obscured by the shadowed hat stands that crowd their work space. Seen as little more than a silhouette, the figure at right works carefully on a hat. Her attentiveness is not shared by her older counterpart who, though grasping a swath of pink fabric, appears lost in thought, gazing beyond the frame with a disquieting expression. The brightly colored ribbons--pink, yellow, orange, and green--draw attention to the drabness of the room and its inhabitants.Over the course of about thirty years, Edgar Degas produced more than twenty paintings,pastels, and drawings of millinery shops. Among modern painters, Degas alone depicted this subject matter with such frequency. His voyeuristic yet empathetic portrait of the milliner's private world focuses on the physical hardship of their work. The woman at the left embodies the painter's concern; even at rest, her wiry body and pallid skin registers a life of hard work and meager reward.
One of Edgar Degas's earliest documented involvements with photography occurred in 1885, when he directed the creation of a parody of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's grandhistory painting,The Apotheosis ofHomer,now in theLouvreMuseum. A local photographer, Walter Barnes, made the negative and print, surely following Degas's explicit instructions. Entitled theApotheosis of Degas,it is very much an aggrandized self-portrait of Degas.
Like Edgar Degas'sNude (Drying Herself),this photograph of a woman putting on stockings shares the specific theme, the awkward intimacy, and the formal compositional qualities of some of his drawings and paintings of women in various stages of undress.Degas, a bachelor, showed a strong curiosity about the private, everyday rituals women perform--bathing, dressing, and ironing. Yet he would have had few opportunities to candidly observe a woman in this position. Scholars are uncertain whether Degas posed an artist's model in his studio or actually took his camera to a brothel.
 Daylight is too easy. What I want is difficult--the atmosphere of lamps or moonlight,  wrote Edgar Degas of making photographs. This self-portrait with Louise Halvy features a reading lamp prominently in the center of thecomposition. Halvy and Degas are rendered sketchily--a hand here, an ear there--yet the lamp is portrayed in detail. Degas did render the atmosphere of lamplight, but not the illumination from it. The shade remains dark, and Halvy casts a long shadow over the paper she is meant to be reading, indicating a source of light from behind her. However, the low light level creates an atmosphere of tranquil contemplation and sets the mood for this private scene.
One of Edgar Degas's most daring experiments in photography was to enlarge his negatives at a time when techniques for doing so first became reliable. To achieve the enlarging, he utilized the services of Tasset et Lhote, an artists' supply shop that was one of the first to also supply photographic services. From Guillaume Tasset, Degas obtained photographic supplies and sought advice about procedures, and from Tasset's daughter Delphine, who operated the photo studio, he ordered enlargements. This image of his childhood friend Louise Halvy reading, printed by Delphine Tasset, is an example of Degas's experiments with enlarging.
Louise Halvy, Edgar Degas's friend since childhood, reclines with eyes closed as if in reverie, having fallen asleep reading. The gas lamp that lights the scene is so intense that it appears in the picture as a flare of dominating, unmodulated white, thus breaking the rules of  good  photography. Not formally trained in photography, Degas wrote of wanting to photograph intangible subjects like shadows and states of mind like dreaming.
Edgar Degas lived within walking distance of the Halvy residence and dined with the family regularly on Thursday evenings.  We have made him not just an intimate friend but a member of our family, his own being scattered all over the world,  wrote Daniel Halvy. This intimate bond, at its strongest during the period of Degas's photographic activity, is apparent in Halvy's casual comfort in his home and in front of the photographer. By January 1898 their friendship had become increasingly strained and then altogether severed because of Degas's anti-Semitism and opposing political views.
Women can never forgive me; they hate me, they feel that I am disarming them. I show them without their coquetry.Edgar Degas often depicted women in awkward and inelegant poses, eliciting sharp criticism. His comment above makes clear that he was aware of this response to his work. An early practitioner ofRealism, Degas captured women engaged in mundane tasks--laundresses ironing, prostitutes waiting for clients, and, most frequently, women bathing.The intimate subject of this painting, a woman bathing in a private interior, is one that invites voyeurism. Degas depicted the woman lying on a divan, while her maid dries or combs her hair. With her back pushed to the extremeforegroundof the images, she seems to hold the viewer at bay. Bracing herself with her left arm, the woman uncomfortably raises her left leg against the edge of the bathtub. Such unnatural poses have perplexed critics of Degas's time, as they do viewers today. Some see these poses as an attempt to depict human movement not in idealized forms, but in ordinary, private behavior. Others see such representations of women as misogynistic.
The title of this photograph is more poetic than indicative of an actual scene. The blackened bottom of the model's foot suggests that the photograph was really made before, not after the bath. The casual setting is entirely fictional, and the towel and sofa are mere props for her unusual posturing. The model twists her torso in an unnatural position as the shadows contrive to decapitate her. Her contorted pose is purely formal; she does not appear to be drying any part of her body. Like many artists, Edgar Degas made photographs as preparatory studies for his drawings and paintings. This photograph may have been made in connection with a series of drawings devoted to the motions of women dressing and bathing.
The wordsAve gratia plena Dominus tecum(Greetings most favored one! The Lord is with you) from Luke 1:8 flow from thearchangelGabriel's mouth as he announces the conception ofChristto theVirgin Mary. Much as in modern comic books, Tommaso del Mazza visualized Gabriel's speech for the viewer to follow along. In Mary's lap thebibleis opened to the prophecy ofIsaiah:  Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son...  (Isaiah 7:14). Gently touching her chest, Mary leans forward to acknowledge her destiny. Above, God the Father floats in a mandorla of angels as the dove of theHoly Spiritdescends to Mary at the moment ofIncarnation.TheAnnunciationtakes place in a spatially ambiguous structure in which Mary appears too large.Tooledhaloes, gold, and vivid colors heighten the intensity of the moment and add to the overall impression of sumptuousness.This panel was created by Tommaso del Mazza, until recently known only as the Master of Saint Verdiana, who worked in the lateGothicstyle during theRenaissancein Florence.
Perino del Vaga produced this delicate ink and wash design as a study for frescoes in a chapel within the Vatican. The Adoration of the Magi appears on both sides of the arched, recessed window at the top. The three kings gather to admire the Christ Child standing in his mother's lap on the right. In the center of the lower register is the Crucifixion scene, surrounded by scenes from the Passion of Christ, the theme of the chapel. The coats of arms of various popes fill the window frame at the top.In 1520 this chapel was assigned to the Vatican's Swiss Guards, and shortly afterwards Perino was commissioned to decorate it. Scholars believe that this drawing was made around 1522 because it contains the coat of arms of Pope Adrian VI, who only led the Church for a year, from 1522 and 1523. Perino began work on the frescoes in 1522 but he never completed them because of a serious plague outbreak in 1523. The frescoes were later finished by Polidoro da Caravaggio.
Perino del Vaga covered both sides of this sheet with drawings of figures and architecture. On the recto, he first made the six smaller figures that fit around the architectural ovals in the lower two-thirds of the drawing. Given the individualized nature of their attributes and poses, he seems to have intended them all for specific locations in a domed vault, although none of them relate to any of Perino's known works.The four heads in profile at the top of the recto and the one at the top center of the verso differ in several ways; they were all drawn later than the other sketches. The later drawings are all much more lightly shaded with pale strokes of wash, and each profile wears an elaborate, fanciful hat or headdress and an exaggerated expression approaching caricature. These figures may represent costumed characters in a ballet or theatrical display. Scholars have not yet determined the purpose of the five other heavily shaded figures on the verso, two of whom seem to be in close discussion at the bottom left.
A young woman in a vivid blue gown, red sash, tartan shawl, and small military cap hangs her head in despair. She grieves for the fallen warrior whose blood seeps into the ground from his fatal wound. He wears a suit of armor, and his sword and helmet lie at his side. The subject is taken fromLara, a poem by Lord Byron published in 1814. Lara, a Spanish overlord, returns from exile accompanied by Kaled, a young page of foreign birth. Lara becomes the leader of a peasant revolt, which is eventually suppressed by Otho, a hostile neighboring baron. In a final battle against overwhelming odds, Lara is mortally wounded by an arrow. He dies under the care of the faithful Kaled, who in the end is revealed to be a young maiden in disguise who is in love with him. The stiff body of the dead hero contrasts with the sagging, limp posture of the bereaved Kaled.Eugne Delacroix displayed his skill at depicting a literary subject on a small scale. A brilliant colorist, Delacroix used rich shades of greens, browns, blues, and reds and scraped the paper in some areas to achieve certain textures and highlights.
In this scene from Lord Byron's poemThe Corsair, the beautiful Gulnare, a member of the Pasha's harem, visits the imprisoned corsair or pirate Conrad. They fall in love, and Gulnare eventually offers to kill the Pasha and free her beloved.Eugne Delacroix drew and painted many subjects from Byron, in whose poems the artist found the emotional, exotic subject matter he sought. In orientalizing scenes like this one, he captured the struggles of the heart, matching his innovative use of color and loosely applied brushwork with unprecedented and controversial themes.Delacroix exhibited this watercolor in the Salon of 1831. Having learned the watercolor technique from his British friends, he used it both for independent works of art and as a medium for sketching nature. He aptly described his approach, saying,  The special charm of watercolor, beside which any painting in oil always appears rusty and yellowed, is due to the inherent transparency of the paper. 
With his right arm outstretched, the part-man, part-horse Chiron teaches Achilles to hunt with bow and arrow. The young pupil follows the centaur's guidance and directs his weapon toward a target beyond the sheet's top right corner. The two figures hold relatively similar poses, conveying the emotional bond between them. The drawing also suggests movement and power: as the pair turn to the upper right, Chiron's horse-body hurtles diagonally through the center of the composition.In 1838, the forty-year old Eugne Delacroix received one of his most significant public commissions: the large curved ceiling of the Deputies' Library of the Palais Bourbon. Completed in 1847, Delacroix's decorative program illustrated the themes of Philosophy, Science, Poetry, Law, and Theology. Related to the theme of Poetry, this pencil drawing on tracing paper, is one of several in which Delacroix explored this dynamic composition. It was conceived to accommodate an unusually shaped section of the library's ceiling. Delacroix kept this work in his studio and returned to it more than twenty years later when he created a pastel of the same subject, also in the Getty's collection, as a gift for the writer Georges Sand.
Dramatically lit and heroically isolated, a Moroccan horseman, fist upraised, charges across a ford, his horse rearing as it gains the riverbank. Behind them stretches an expansive plain where another lone horseman gallops towards a military encampment. The two rearing horses echo each other, just as the foremost horse's tail repeats the form of the weeds on the riverbank.In the background, under a turbulent sky, lies a chain of dark mountains.Delacroix drew inspiration for this painting from his 1832 trip to Morocco, during which he feverishly took notes and made countless sketches and watercolors. The horsemen he encountered in Morocco were among his favorite subjects. As his writings attest, Delacroix saw in them a living incarnation of the noble of spirit and terrible strength of will that he associated with the heroes of antiquity. He designed this small-scale painting for private contemplation, signaling a general retreat into a more subjective realm of exoticism and fantasy.
 It is beautiful, even more beautiful, I believe, than the painting. I am enraptured, dear friend,  wrote novelist George Sand to Eugne Delacroix in gratitude for his gift of this pastel. It was the last pastel Delacroix ever made and his last present to Sand.Delacroix had first captured this subject--Chiron, the wisest of all centaurs, training Achilles in the art of hunting--on a corner of a curved ceiling devoted to poetry in Paris's Palais Bourbon Library, which he decorated from 1838 to 1847. On visits to Delacroix's studio twenty years later, Sand admired the new, rectangular painting of the subject the artist was working on. That canvas was promised to another admirer, so Delacroix made this nearly identical pastel for her and wrote to Sand's son, Maurice, informing him of the gift.Highly educated in the classics, Delacroix depicted subjects from antiquity throughout his life. Like his compatriot Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Delacroix used ancient marble sculptures as his source but to entirely different effect. Ingres's figures retained the cool purity of stone, while Delacroix used movement and color to animate and integrate nude, horse, and landscape.
An endless expanse of debris and devastation convey the unparalleled power of the tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Meulaboh. In an instant, homes have been reduced to rubble; incongruously colorful shards are littered with clothing, personal effects, and debris. In the distance, the few remaining palm trees underscore the fact that everything else in the scene has been flattened, razed, destroyed. At the photograph's center, a single man embodies the tsunami's human toll. This despondent figure looks over the remains of his home, searching for anything salvageable and, most of all, remembering lives lost.French photographer Luc Delahaye took this photograph in early January 2005--about ten days after the Indian Ocean earthquake that triggered a series of devastating tsunamis across Southeast Asia. Delahaye had first arrived in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh; but finding the international press concentrated there, he traveled southeast to Meulaboh. In this photograph, he focuses his camera on a part of the city closest to the seashore and worst hit by the tsunami. From a distant, frontal point of view, his camera records the scene with detail and accuracy and includes an unusual peripheral vision that reveals destruction as far as the eye can see.Beginning in 2001 with the Afghanistan war, Delahaye initiated a series of large-scale photographs featuring significant events of recent history. On one hand, these detailed, frontal works relate to the tradition of documentary photography. On the other, their size and narrative power evoke nineteenth-century European painting. Compositionally,Aftermath in Meulabohrecalls Caspar David Friedrich's early 1800s paintingArctic Shipwreck--which also depicts nature's destructive power.
Beneath a seatedpersonificationof Faith, each of these images focuses on a specific act of faith from theOld Testament. In the center,Mosescauses the waters of the Red Sea to drown Pharoah's army. In the two side ovals, Joshua and the Israelites bring down the walls of Jericho, and Gideon chooses his soldiers according to whether they lapped water instead of kneeling down to drink. At the bottom, Jacob sacrifices his sonIsaac.In minute detail tienne Delaune delineated the strapwork cartouche with its ornamentalputti, thegrotesquemasks at the lower corners, and the bunches of fruit. He carefully applied areas ofwashto give the blank plaques and curling strapwork the impression of three-dimensionality. He probably intended the drawing as a design for a wall decoration. The elaborate frame of the drawing would have been sculpted in stuccorelief, and the various empty spaces would have contained inscriptions.
On top of a gnarled tree, an eagle stands with outstretched wings. With its claws, the imposing bird attacks a coiled serpent. Two putti pull at the wings of a second eagle that carries a pair of entwined spouts on its back. This fanciful scene is a design for a glass cup and is explained in the inscription at the bottom of the sheet: white wine should be poured into one tube and red wine into the other, so that the red wine fills the eagles and snakes, and the white wine fills the rest.Stefano della Bella began this work by creating a preliminary sketch in black chalk. He then worked the sketch using a finely sharpened quill pen. Avoiding hard outlines, della Bella used tiny hair-like strokes for the contours to define the forms. A blue wash evokes the presence of liquid inside a transparent shell.Della Bella made this design for a member of the Medici family in Florence. Elaborate glass table ornaments were common at the Medici court and often accompanied ceremonial banquets. However, this drawing's complexity suggests that a goblet constructed to its fantastic design never graced the tabletop at a Medici feast. Instead, it served as an example of artistic ingenuity, admired by the patron as proof of della Bella's imaginative powers.
The earthenwarebustof a bearded man with Roman style armor and a toga was originally part of a series of busts in three-quarterrelief, set within wreathedmedallionson the flat gray walls of the courtyard of the Chteau d'Assier in Figeac, a short distance south of Paris. Girolamo della Robbia, an Italian sculptor and ceramist, designed the series of elegant yet stern exemplars of Roman andGallicheroes for the residence of one of KingFranois I'simportant military leaders. TheItalianatestyle of the series, seen for example in the bust format and the Roman costume, demonstrates strong ties toClassical antiquity. This revival, explicitly encouraged by the king, was also very fashionable among the aristocracy of the king's court.
Dark, swirling clouds loom over a narrow strip of land, gently punctuated by far-off trees and a city skyline. The place is Rome. The weather: an impending rainstorm. The day: a late afternoon within the last decades of the 1700s.This painting is one in a series of cloud studies--in fact the 48th--that Simon Denis made to hone his observational and painting skills. Denis' confident paint handling and sensitive rendering of light capture the awe-inspiring power of nature. Using a warm palette, he juxtaposed light and dark tones to imply both the clouds' airy buoyancy and moisture-laden heaviness. Lively brushstrokes convey the constantly shifting forces of wind and light.This dramatic cloudscape predates by a century the Impressionists' celebration of outdoor landscape painting in which they recorded specific, yet fleeting, effects of weather and time and exhibited those results as finished paintings. But in Denis' time, oil sketching on paper while outdoors offered the artist an opportunity to test and sharpen his skills. Denis would have kept his cloud studies in the studio for future reference for his finished paintings.
Beginning in 1778, the Svres Porcelain Manufactory produced garnitures of five vases to a design called thevases des ges(vases of the ages). These ornamental vases were made in three sizes: a large central vase with handles in the shape of bearded male heads, a pair of smaller vases with heads of young women, and a pair of still smaller vases with heads of boys. In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles. The scenes painted on the fronts of these vases showed episodes fromThe Adventures of Telemachus,one of the king's favorite books. The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Svres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the rpareur, tienne-Henry Bono. The design was created after engravings by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard and after designs by Charles Monnet. tienne-Henri Le Guay gilded the vases.
Desiderio da Settignano, or a draftsman from his workshop, drew seven sketches of the Virgin and the infant Jesus in pen and ink over elaborate stylus underdrawings that frequently differ greatly from the overdrawings in pen. He used a light, delicate touch and concentrated on the outline of the forms with minimal internal modeling. The artist drew more broadly on the verso, using considerable black chalk underdrawing along with the brown ink. Here the Virgin and Child sit in profile on an elaborate throne ornamented with a sphinx, a curling rinceaux motif, and various floral designs. Given the profile format, scholars believe this sheet was probably intended as a study for a relief, perhaps in terracotta. Renaissance sculptors used drawings as important tools for numerous purposes: to experiment with new ideas, for workshop assistants to copy, or to tempt a patron with selections for a new commission.
The Savonnerie workshops, the royal manufactory that provided carpets, screens, and covers for chairs and benches for the sole use of the French royal household, made this pair of three-panel screens of knotted woolen pile. Such screens were known asparavents(against the wind) and were usually kept folded in the corners of dining rooms or anterooms of the palaces. When needed, servants would arrange the screens to protect the occupants from drafts.The Savonnerie manufactory produced eight different designs for screens, of which the Getty Museum's examples are the tallest. Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay provided thecartoonsfor these screens in 1714, and Franois Desportes drew the birds in the central panels. Each panel has a yellow ground, while the flowers, leaves, and birds are woven in equally vivid shades. The relatively unfaded colors of this pair make them exceptional in comparison to other surviving screens.
In the 1700s folding screens of this size, known asparavents, were used mainly in salons or dining rooms to protect the occupants from drafts. This screen has four panels made after two repeating designs. Two panels depict brown-and-cream rabbits in front of a trellis of peach trees, with monkeys and birds on top. The other two panels contain three waterfowl at the base; above, a blue and yellow macaw clings to a trellis of roses and squawks at an African crowned crane. The borders of these scenes imitate the shape of gilt woodboiseries(wood paneling) that would have covered the walls of rooms where they were used.The wool panels were knotted like a carpet and attached to a wood frame with rows of brass tacks.
Furniture made entirely of metal was extremely rare in the 1700s as each individual piece had to be laboriously forged. Very few pieces still exist today. This console table, executed in the massive earlyNeoclassicalstyle, was almost certainly made by Pierre Deumier, a metal worker and a locksmith. In a French newspaper he advertised a table whose description closely matches this console. A similar console table appears in a 1766 drawing by the French architect Victor Louis. The Polish king Stanislas Auguste II commissioned it for a room in the royal palace in Warsaw. That table was delivered in 1769, but its present location is unknown.
Achille Devria taught drawing andlithographyto his son Thodule Devria, and father and son collaborated on a family portrait album from 1853 until Achille's death. They applied inkwashto several of the portraits in the album, possibly in preparation for printing lithographs from the photographs. This image is an example of one of the photographs that has been enhanced with ink. It has been printed very lightly, an effect that softens the portrait of Achille, who looks somberly at the camera, his clothes shrouding his gaunt body. The application of the ink is sketchy, but it adds a texture to thebackgroundthathighlightsthe figure.
Formed from a disparate array of geometric shapes, this painted steel sculpture resists straightforward description. From a parallelogram-shaped base emerges a circular form inset with thin beams evoking the hands of a clock. A pair of black beams, shaped like an  L  on its side, juts away from the circle. At the top of the work, balancing on a thin black pin, fancifully cut forms interconnect to create a roughly circular shape. This circle includes the sculpture's one piece of recognizable imagery--an oversized pair of pliers.The myriad elements of Mark di Suvero's sculpture are sharp-edged and roughly formed. But viewed as a single object, the piece takes on an almost poetic wholeness. This unity is enhanced by the works kinetic properties. With the thick black beam serving as an essential counterbalance, many of the piece's surfaces can be set in gentle motion by the lightest touch or breeze. Despite variations in size and shape, the forms move in the same time and rhythm. Gandy dancer  is a slang term for a railroad maintenance worker originating in the late 1800s. Gandy dancer crews were known for accompanying their laborious, repetitive work with singing and dancing. Although the connection between this abstract work and its title is elusive, the jagged steel of di Suvero's sculpture and its kinetic elements can be related to the rhythmic labor on the railroad.
The woman in a straw hat with a blanket draped over her shoulders was a patient at the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum. In 1848 Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond became superintendent of the female department there and began a systematic photo-documentation of the inmates to supersede the engraved portraits commissioned by his predecessor. Diamond made the photographs both for the patients' personal records and to serve as aids in diagnosis and treatment. This patient's diagnosis is unknown, but the fact that the photograph was made in an insane asylum leaves open the interpretation of the scene. The way the woman cradles the dead bird with its limp, broken neck while wearing a surprised, slightly bemused expression presents an uneasy question of whether she mourns the bird's death or was the cause of it.
The engravings of Franois de Cuvillis, one of the leading interpreters of theRococostyle in Southern Germany and an architect forMaximilian II Emanuel,Electorof Bavaria, influenced the design of this pair of ornately carved German commodes.Carved white  pearls  hang from the foreheads and the ears of the femalebustsadorning the corners, while scrolling leaves hang from the lower edge. The combination of white painted surfaces and gilded, pierced elements probably reflects the interior for which the commodes were originally designed. These commodes, with their sculptural elements in carved wood, differ from contemporary French pieces, which would have had applied gilt-bronze mounts for decoration.
These coolers were designed to hold half-bottles of wine set in ice or cold water and probably once formed part of a large dinner service. With their fanciful chinoiserie scenes of gold and platinum pagodas on a black ground, the wine coolers imitate Chineselacquerwork. In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Svres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.
In this small, oval-trimmed portrait, the organ grinder throws his head back as if lost in the music he is creating. An intimate study of a street performer at work, this portrait can be compared with the Charles Ngre study of another organ grinder,Organ-Grinder at 21, Quai Bourbon; le Saint-Louis, Paris.In that photograph the subject is shown at the end of the day's work, bent from the weight of his instrument. In reality, this man, too, is bracing his body against the weighty instrument in order to remain posed for the photograph. His hand is upon the handle, but if he were really turning and playing the instrument, the photograph would have been rendered as a hopeless blur. Andr Adolphe-Eugne Disdri successfully evoked the spirit of the music-man through sensitive arrangement and natural gestures.
Capitalizing on the popularity of calling cards in the mid-1800s, the French photographer A.A.E. Disdri seized upon the idea of pasting photographs to small cards. Cheap to produce, the carte-de-visite instantly became a popular form of portraiture during the 1850s and 60s. Images of celebrities and performers were in high demand and it was not unusual for a collector to assemble a group of such cards in one large album. Among the various dancers shown here is the noted ballerina Marie Petipa.
Thisphotogenic drawingof a plant specimen shows the stems of the plant species in various stages of growth, from an almost-solid staff to a spidery, blossoming branch. It is a page fromCyanotypesof British and Foreign Ferns, an album of one hundred botanical illustrations with hand-written titles now in the Getty Museum. Anne Dixon originally gave the album to her nephew, who was interested in photographically illustrated volumes.Dixon and Anna Atkins created each image, or photogenic drawing, by carefully placing the specimen onto a sheet of paper that had been made light-sensitive by a coating of a combination of chemicals. The resulting print is called a cyanotype because of the blue color produced by the chemicals. Securing the specimens to the paper with a sheet of glass, the glass and paper were then placed in the sun; after sufficient exposure to light, the paper was washed in water, which caused the image to appear in its final form. Because the specimens were solid objects that light could not pass through, they appear as negative images.
In the upper region of this elaborate drawing, the Madonna and Christ Child survey four saints appealing for the banishment of the plague. The Madonna gestures toward a kneelingSaint Jeromewho, accompanied by his lion, makes an emotional plea with arms wide apart. Above Jerome, Saint John Nepomuk makes a similar appeal. In the lower third of the drawing, Saint Sebastian--with his quiver of arrows in front of him--and Saint Roch gesture dramatically toward theMadonna and Child. The saints' appeals appear to have been heard: At the right edge of the scene, a figure symbolizing the plague flees from an angel brandishing a trumpet.Gaspare Diziani was a prolific draftsman, but most of his drawings do not exhibit such a high degree of finish. Thismodellotherefore, may have been shown to a patron for a proposed large-scalealtarpiece. The inclusion of Saint John Nepomuk, a patron saint of Prague and Munich, and the unusual crowns worn by the Madonna and Christ Child, suggest that the drawing dates to the artist's stay in Germany from 1717 to 1720. Much of the original preparatory red-chalk underdrawing remains visible, revealing changes made by Diziani. For example, Saint Roch's right arm was extended initially, but in the finished ink drawing the arm is placed on his chest.
Designed to hold two candles each, this pair of vases would have formed part of a garniture of similarly decorated vessels. The decoration on these vessels--pink and green ground colors and scenes based on seventeenth-century paintings--typifies theRococostyle used at the Svresporcelainmanufactory around 1760. Charles-Nicolas Dodin based the rustic scene of a standing couple on a painting by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger.
This boat-shaped vase is one of the most famous models introduced by the Svresporcelainmanufactory; such discerning patrons asMadame de Pompadourand her brother themarquis de Marignycollected the form. Among the largest vessels produced by the factory, these vases were extremely difficult to fire; the multiple piercings in the body weakened the overall structure, and they tended to collapse in the kiln. Consequently, only about twelve were ever produced, ten of which survive today.The shape derives from thenef, a table decoration in the form of a ship, usually of precious metals, used since medieval times. This vase would have held potpourri used to perfume a room. Eighteenth-century ladies made their own, experimenting with various ingredients and sometimes blending essences for as long as nine years. Vases known asvaisseau  mat(masted ships) were made to be sold with other vases of different shapes to form a garniture. Claude-Nicolas Dodin painted the rustic scene on the front, copying an engraving after a painting by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger.
The complex construction and decoration of this pair of vases reveal the level of skill achieved by the craftsmen employed at the Svres porcelain manufactory. Each vase is divided into three sections: a base with holes for flowering bulbs, a tall body with pierced shoulders for potpourri, and a pierced lid. Painted ripples along the base and waves that project up the body, simulating cascades of water, give these vases their name ofpot pourri fontaine.Charles-Nicolas Dodin, who painted the Chinese figures on the sides, copied them from Chinesewoodcutsof about 1700.These vases once formed part of a garniture owned byMadame de Pompadour, mistress ofLouis XV. An inventory taken after her death in 1764 mentions that the garniture was displayed on the mantelpiece in her bedroom. The set was accompanied by matching porcelain wall lights, a pair of candelabra, and a potpourri vase(vaisseau  mat),both now in theMuse du Louvre.
In 1758 the Svresporcelainmanufactory introduced this shape, designed to be mounted onto a small table. The manufactory named the form, described in the Svres archives as aplateau de Courteille ou de chiffonire,after the marquis de Courteille, one ofLouis XV'sfinanciers, who represented the king's interest at Svres from 1751.The Svres artist Charles-Nicolas Dodin copied the scene from a painting by Franois Boucher onto the plaque. The original painting was set into wood paneling above a door in an important Parisian townhouse, the Htel de Soubise. It became one of Boucher's most popular scenes in the 1700s, known through many prints that circulated widely throughout Europe.
With its depiction ofVenus, the goddess of love, crouching in her bath, this damaged statuette is a copy of an original large-scale sculpture dating to the 100s B.C., probably by Doidalsas of Bithynia. The goddess crouches low in order to allow an attendant, who is not depicted, to pour water over her. The original statue showed the interest ofHellenisticsculptors in rendering the nude female form.While the earlier statue does not survive, later copies such as this piece preserve its general appearance. These copies were especially popular in the Roman period, with artists reproducing the original in large numbers in a variety of media and sizes and with slight variations of pose. Roman patrons often commissioned miniature copies of large-scale Greek public art for their private use, decorating their homes with the statuettes. The use of the valuable medium ofrock crystalmarks this piece as a prestigious luxury item for a rich patron.
The swollen, curved form of this large commode is calledbomb. A small wheel at the center front of the lower drawer supports its weight, allowing it to be opened with greater ease. The gilt bronzemountsin the form of male and female heads on the corners and festoonedlambrequinsin the center are part of the repertory consistently used by the cabinetmaker tienne Doirat. On the interior, the sides of the drawers curve to correspond with the curving sides of the commode; this feature serves no practical purpose other than to display the cabinetmaker's virtuosity.Doirat, whose name is stamped on the top of the commode, was one of the few cabinetmakers to regularly place his name on his works before aguildrule in the late 1740s made stamping mandatory.
Who is this young girl  The strand of pearls encircling her neck, the chain hanging beneath her bodice, and her heavily embroidered gown all suggest that she is from an upper class family, but nothing more is known of her identity. The girl stares out from large eyes. Her wispy, shoulder-length hair is held back with a ribbon, and her upturned lips reveal a slight trace of a smile.Carlo Dolci's contemporaries greatly admired him as a portrait painter, although he preferred to be known for his religious scenes. Here his sharp eye for detail captured the pale fringe of hair that frames her forehead, the small, hooped earrings, and the rosy flushed cheeks. The delicate chalk strokes that shade her face contrast with the looser style used on her dress. A series of zigzagging lines describes the ornament on her bodice, while loose shading gives texture to the fabric.
Carlo Dolci painted this canvas for his confessor as part of a series depicting the four evangelists. Wearing delicately painted robes of red and blue,Saint Matthewleans to the left, concentrating on his work. He is writing the words that open theGospelof Matthew, which was considered the first divinely inspired Christian text. The words are accurately reproduced in Hebrew, the saint's native language. At his side, a wingedputtoholds an inkpot and looks up admiringly at Matthew.Dolci meticulously described the textures of the saint's wispy beard, his wavy hair, the heavy softness of his robe, even minute details like the dirt under the saint's fingernails. Highly popular in his time, Dolci was known for his devotional paintings. His refined canvases combined a polished, precise technique with a sentimentality that appealed topatrons, particularly in his native Florence.
The cross pins Christ to the ground under its weight as he struggles on the way to his Crucifixion. With his mouth parted as if to speak, Christ looks sorrowfully out at the viewer. The large figures and compressed composition enhance the sense of his oppression under the massive cross and the cruelty of his tormentors.Domenichino paid particular attention to individualized types; the attendant soldiers and executioners seem studiously painted from individual models. A Roman soldier in armor and sandals leads the procession and gestures with a baton at Simon of Cyrene, who tries to assist Christ. Behind them, another soldier tugs sharply on the rope tied around the body of Christ and raises his right arm as if to strike. Shocked faces from the civilian throng that accompanied Christ to Calvary are visible between his legs. In the background are various figures: a man in a fringed red hat carrying a ladder on his shoulders and two more soldiers, one on horseback and another on foot.The painting's coloring has retained its strong impact because of the superior preservative qualities of oil on a copper surface.
Tilting her head back, an ecstatic Saint Cecilia gazes heavenward in an appropriate martyr's pose. Virgin martyr and the patron saint of music, Cecilia is thought to have lived in the 100s or 200s A.D. After laborers discovered her miraculously preserved body beneath the altar of the Church of Santa Cecilia in 1599, her cult grew strong in Rome, and artists portrayed her often, because she represented the union of religion and music.Domenichino probably made this drawing in preparation for hisfrescodecorations in the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, on which he worked from 1612 to 1615. Scholars identify this female head as Saint Cecilia based on its similarity to the Cecilia in that fresco, where she wears the same expression of ecstasy asputticarry her up to heaven.The pricking on this sheet shows that Domenichino's assistants probably transferred its outlines to another sheet, most likely the Muse du Louvre's much largercartoonfor the entire fresco. In theLouvrecartoon, Cecilia's head corresponds more closely to the fresco, so scholars assume that the Louvre cartoon was later. The four pieces of paper that comprise this sheet show that this fragment was also originally part of a larger cartoon.
A highly successful and ruthless general, Don Juan Jos of Austria suppressed an anti-Spanish uprising in Naples when he was only eighteen years old. This scene shows his triumphal entry following the suppression of the revolt. A young fisherman had led a protest against a new tax on fruit imposed by the aristocracy; the protest later turned into an insurrection aiming at slaughtering the nobility. As the general leads his cavalry into the city, trampling a child underfoot, he receives the homage of the population in the person of the bearded man kneeling to the left, who offers a platter containing three utensils, perhaps representing the keys of the city.Jos Ximnez Donoso copied the equestrian figure from a well-known etching by Jusepe de Ribera but added soldiers and spectators to thebackground. The artist drew the whole scene in black chalk but reinforced the forms of Don Jos and his horse, copied from the print, in pen and brown ink. The drawing issquaredfor transfer, implying that thecompositionwas intended for a painting or perhaps a print.
About 1670, Lambert Doomer made this drawing following an earlier drawing composed during a trip to northern France in 1646. While carefully depicting the town of Saumur's landmarks, he added local citizens and animals to give the vista a picturesque effect. He enlivened the scene with color, using subtle modulations of wash to suggest the sky's atmosphere and light and shadow on the ground.Doomer made over twenty drawings of Saumur. He centered thiscompositionon the town's chteau with the river Loire in theforeground. At the foot of the chteau sits the church of Saint-Pierre. Saumur's other churches, Ntre-Dame de Natilly and Ntre-Dame des Ardilliers, appear at the right. The stone structure next to the seated draftsman at left may be the church of Saint-Lambert, an identification supported by the inscription on theverso.
I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,Who now doth crazy go,Laughed loud and long, and all the whileHis eyes went to and fro Ha! Ha!  quoth he,  full plain I see,The Devil knows how to row. --Samuel Taylor Coleridge, fromThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poemThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerrecounts the tale of a young mariner's supernatural adventures at sea. This watercolor is a study for one of thirty-eight images that artist Gustave Dor created to illustrate editions of the poem published in 1875 and 1876.This scene takes place near the end of the poem (lines 564-569), after the Mariner is forever cursed for shooting an albatross. This slaughter triggers a curse that causes the death of the Mariner's entire crew, forcing him to navigate the seas alone for seven days and nights.This image illustrates the moment the masts of Mariner's ship disappear into a mighty white froth, shown at the center left. A pilot and his son have just rescued the Mariner, but thought him dead. When the Mariner instead takes the oars, as seen here at center, the men think he is the Devil and go insane. Dor depicts one of them slumped at the base of the picture frame, behind the Mariner. The other lolls over the right side of the boat. The dark, austere figure of the Holy Hermit, looms at the top right of the boat, perhaps signaling the misery awaiting the Mariner on shore, where he will be doomed to wander the earth for eternity to tell his story as penance.Dor's varied watercolor techniques and the work's large size both serve the drama of the poem.The waves, in their gloomy palette and multiple washes of brown, grey, black, and white, offer a convincing sense of depth and foreboding. White heightening evokes a splash of foam that ribbons up in the air like lightning on the front right of the boat. The Mariner is shown with his back to us, faceless, bracing his weight with his right leg against the churning waves, as if to emphasize the struggle of humankind against the wilds of nature.
Dosso Dossi depicted the aftermath of Saint George's battle with the dragon, in which he wields the creature's bloodied head and the lance broken during the fight. Under an emerging rainbow, the victoriouspatron saintof Ferrara, Italy, emerges from the darkness of the battle. Dossi poignantly expressed his subject's recent emotional turmoil in the saint's penetrating expression. He appears weary yet resolute in his triumph.The symbols of Saint George's Christian faith--crosses rendered in vivid strokes of red paint as though the blood of his opponent drips down its shaft--mark the weapon. The color of the crosses echoes the blood ringing the beast's mouth and also symbolizes the blood ofChrist.
An array of enticing visual clues has given rise to many theories about Dosso Dossi'sMythological Scene,but no one has determined the painting's precise meaning. The cupids in the sky, the lush setting, and the sensuous nude lying on a bed of flowers indicate that the subject is love. The male figure on the right is the Greek godPan, asatyr. InRenaissanceallegorieshe personifies lust, since he seduced thenymphswith the music of the pipes held in his left hand. The sleeping nude in theforegroundmay be the nymphEcho, who spurned Pan forNarcissus. The old woman at the center of the group could be Echo's protectorTerra, who sits above her and shields her from harm. Next to the old woman and dressed in a green gown, billowing red cape, and armor is a mysterious and yet to be identified woman. Her costume indicates that she is likely a goddess. Dossi painted this figure and then changed his mind and covered her up with a landscape. She was uncovered again during a restoration in the 1800s.Additional clues also tell scholars that the painting was cut down by about six inches on the left side at some point. The arm of anothercupidcan be seen at the painting's upper left edge, and a x-radiograph reveals the partially cut-off figure of a man under the lower part of the landscape.X-rayphotographs also display variouspentimenti, or alterations made by the artist. Initially, Dossi included a suit of armor and a sword hanging from the lemon tree, a cello held by the woman in the red cape, and a downward gaze for the old woman.
Found at a flea market and purchased for a modest sum by an anonymous buyer, the unwrapped, seven-footAllegoryofFortunewas strapped to the roof of a car and brought to Christie's auction house in New York City. There experts recognized it as an important, long-lost allegorical scene by the Ferrarese master Dosso Dossi.While the painting's precise meaning remains a mystery, Dosso's message seems to be that prosperity in life is transitory and dependent on luck. The nude woman represents Fortune, or Lady Luck. She holds acornucopia, flaunting the bounty that she could bring, but sits on a bubble because her favors are often fleeting. The billowing drapery is a reminder that she is changeable like the wind. Her single shoe symbolizes her ability to bring not only fortune but also misfortune.The man on the left personifies chance. He looks over at Fortune and holds up a stack of lottery tickets, which he is about to place inside a golden urn, a timely reference to the civic lotteries that had just become popular in Italy. The tickets may also refer to the painting's probablepatron,Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua. One of heremblemswas a bundle of lots, denoting her personal experience with fluctuating fortune.
In an arched, window-like opening, an astronomer works late into the night. Concentrating, he reads an astronomical treatise and measures the distance between two points on a celestial globe. The candle he holds provides the only source of light; it illuminates his face, the book, the precious globe, the beaker of water, and his hourglass.Strong contrasts between light and dark show the painter Gerrit Dou's knowledge of a popular Baroque technique known aschiaroscuro. Carefully rendering minute details such as the handwriting in the book, the texture of the glass flask, and the folds in the astronomer's cloak was Dou's special talent. Collectors treasured these small, detailed paintings for pleasurable observation in their private rooms.
A youth sits despondently wrapped in his cloak, his head in his hand, on the interior of this fragment of an Athenianred-figurekylixor cup. An older, bearded man stands before him. The scene probably illustrates an episode from the mythicalTrojan War, the mission ofOdysseusto Achilles' tent after Briseis, his concubine, was taken from him. Upset by this offense to his honor, Achilles withdrew from the battlefield and sulked in his tent. During his absence, the Greeks lost badly in battle, so the Greek leaders sent a delegation to convince him to return. Even the wily Odysseus, however, proved unable to make Achilles return to battle; only the death of his companion Patrokles motivated Achilles to rejoin the battle.The outside of the cup shows a mythological scene--Herakles competing with the sons of Eurytos in an archery contest--and an everyday scene of athletes training.
On this Athenian white-ground lekythos attributed to Douris, two young warriors put on their armor, assisted by a woman and a young boy. The main lines of the bodies and clothing are drawn in black glaze, and the rest of the drawing is rendered with a brownish line made from diluted glaze. The words written between the figures are kalos inscriptions, praising Athenian youths. Large, white-ground lekythoi with outline drawing like this one are unusual in the early 400s B.C., yet three such lekythoi can be attributed to Douris.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to paint over the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes. However, because the white slip was rather fragile, by the mid- 400s B.C. artists limited the use of this technique to leykthoi used in funerary ritual.
Scenes of the daily lives of Athenian schoolboys decorate thisred-figurecup. In addition to basic literacy and mathematics, Greek boys were trained in athletics and music. On the interior of the cup, a boy holding a lyre stands in front of a bearded man, who must be his music teacher. On the outside, men and boys form similar scenes. The imagined walls of the schoolroom are hung with musical instruments and athletic equipment: lyres, string bags with knucklebones, sponges, andaryballoi. The scenes on this cup are not purely educational, however. On one side of the vase, a boy holds a hare on his lap, while on the other, a man offers a hare to another boy. In addition to serving as a classroom, the gymnasion in its role as the center of Greek physical and intellectual life was also the center of romantic courtship. Hares were popular love gifts in the homosexual relationships between older men and boys favored by the Athenian aristocracy in the early 500s B.C.
The upstairs room at Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville, Tennessee, is a cluttered and collective expression of memories and dreams scratched into surfaces or fading in frames. Papered with headshots, bumper stickers, record albums, and posters, almost every surface--including the ceiling, a clock, a t-shirt, and some beer cans--is inscribed with messages. A  connoisseur of the vernacular,  photographer Jim Dow seeks out rare places that manage to retain their regional flavor and originality while resisting mass cultural homogenization.
A dingy, graffiti-laced room in Nora's Midway Truck stop suggests a scattered, rag-tag clientele stopping occasionally to pick up a game, perhaps to improve their transient fortunes with a confident bet. Pool cues stand idle on either side of the meager window, awaiting players to rescue them from inertia. Three orange plastic chairs and the worn green felt on the pool table punctuate the dirty brown room like fragmented bursts of light and contribute contrasting colors to the image. Years of wear and grime have settled on every surface. Jim Dow evocatively captured the gritty detail of a brief respite offered up to travelers passing through.
Describing himself as a  butterfly collector in search of the perfect specimen,  Jim Dow obsessively captures the built landscape with his camera. Here he views the meticulously decorated interior of a small-town Texas barbershop. In addition to the large mirrors necessary for the business, every inch of wall space is covered with landscapes and portraits seemingly created by one person. Handwritten scraps of paper with prices are tucked into frames; fluorescent lighting illuminates the scene. Nostalgic in its old-fashioned subject matter, this image is immediate in its familiarity, depicting a quintessentially American mainstay of community and locus of storytelling and gossip. Barbers' chairs face forward as if inviting the viewer to come in and sit. The precise detail in Dow's scene--made with a large format camera--heightens the seductive appeal of many pictures within a picture.
The old-fashioned telegraph equipment, quartz clock, and bound ledger notebook in this railroad office suggest that this photograph was made long before the era of fax machines and computers, yet Jim Dow photographed the scene in 1988. Though an open ledger and a white coat casually hanging on a chair imply someone's recent presence, and unexpected departure, the vacant scene is replete with mystery. The image lacks any obvious connection to a particular place or to the railroad; the telegraph and clock, however, evoke the railroad's legacy as a driving force in the development of long distance communication and standardized time.
In the 1700s, this double-handled cup would probably have been used to serve coffee or hot chocolate. Following the Chinese and Japanese custom, Europeans in the 1700s usually drank tea from small handless bowls.Cups made at the Du Paquier porcelain manufactory were tall, higher than they were wide, and could be unstable. For this reason, the factory developed atrembleuse(literally  trembling ) form, in which a raised ring or basket on the saucer held the cup in place and prevented spillage caused by a shaky hand.Porcelain painters often imitated engravings with black enamel decoration known asschwarzlot;this decoration was typical of the Du Paquier factory.
This monumental corner cupboard follows a drawing by the French architect and ornament designer Nicolas Pineau, who was an early exponent of the Rococo style. The cupboard's large scale and exuberant gilt-bronze mounts reflect Eastern European rather than French taste. The cabinet was actually made for a Polish general, Count Jan Klemens Branicki. An inventory of Count Branicki's possessions made at his death describes both the corner cupboard and the objects displayed on its shelves: a collection of mounted Chinese porcelain and clocks, some embellished with porcelain flowers.The drawing of the corner cupboard, or more probably an engraving of it, must have caught Branicki's attention. Dubois was commissioned through a Warsaw dealer to construct the cabinet for the Polish aristocrat. Drawings and engravings were sources frequently used by foreign patrons and craftsmen to order and copy the latest fashions in French interior design.
When opened, the fall front of this secrtaire forms a writing surface, revealing red lacquered drawers and pigeonholes. Figures of European huntsmen, probably members of the Dutch East India Company, adorn the single large panel used to decorate the secrtaire's front. The Dutch maintained almost sole control of trade with China in the 1700s; the Chinese called them the  Southern Barbarians  and often depicted them on lacquerwork and porcelain.The size of the large Chinese lacquer panel probably determined this secrtaire's unusually low and wide shape. French craftsmen cut up the piece of lacquer, attached it to the carcass, and then paintedvernis Martinon the other sides and the frame. Scholars named this technique after the Martin brothers, who were granted a monopoly for making imitations of Chinese and Japanese lacquer in 1730; now the term refers to all French lacquer of this type. French furniture decorated with Chinese lacquer is rare, as French craftsmen usually preferred pieces from Japan.
This secrtaire provided its owner with a display area fitted with glass doors at the top, a writing surface with pigeonholes concealed behind the fall front, and a storage cupboard at the bottom. The delicate, quatrefoil-patternedmarquetrywith mother-of-pearl inlay and the gilt bronze floral swags mounted at the top of the fall front soften its sharply rectilinear form.Although this secrtaire bears the stamp of the cabinetmaker Jacques Dubois, it was actually made by his son Ren. Both the form of the secrtaire and the cupboard with the glass doors above the central section are typical of Ren's style.

This exquisite watercolor is a rare sheet in the extant work of artist Albert Dubois-Pillet. Scenes of the rivers Seine and Marne were among the artist's favorite subjects, the foliage and reflections of sky and scenery were prime inspiration for his pointillist works.The pointillist technique creates an overall image through tiny spots of color. It allows the viewer to almost feel the artist at work, as one can pick out the precise taps of the brush tip against the paper. When seen from afar, for example, this vista's gentle curves, especially those of the bank of trees at right, capture a lush depth and even volume. Up close, however, one can appreciate how this pointillist surface is built up of precise groupings of varying blues and greens, with highlights created by the tiny dots of yellow and of white paper showing through.The palette of this particular work has several striking elements. For example, the choice of orange for the water and clouds creates a sense of excitement in what might otherwise be a purely languorous, even pretty scene.The present sheet is closely related to a painting depicting the same view of the Marne, dated 1888 and currently in the Muse d'Orsay, Paris. This drawing is unlikely to have been a preparatory study, and is instead a more abstract adaptation after the painting, perhaps completed for a collector as a finished work of art in its own right.The work is signed by Dubois-Pillet in watercolor at the lower right.
Framed by an arched doorway, two soldiers sit smoking, drinking, and chatting with a young woman who sits casually on tiled steps. Behind the woman, a warm light enters to permeate the setting and the objects and figures within. To the right, another woman descends a dark staircase and prepares to enter the room. In the foreground a jumble of objects--rifles, armor, a drum, a pipe, an overturned pail, and yellow drapery--form a more complicated still life grouping. On the back wall, a wooden rack holds pewter plates, crockery, and spoons. This genre scene, an unidealized view of everyday life illustrates Jacob Duck's shrewd observation of costumes, setting, and objects, as well as his ability to render the surfaces of metal, stone, cloth, and wood.
Joseph Ducreux experimented with the traditional limitations of thegenreof self-portraiture by creating an expressive, humorous, and rather unorthodox image of himself stretching and yawning. Dressed informally in a turban and bright red jacket, Ducreux, in the midst of a huge yawn, opens his mouth wide, contorting his face with the effort and stretching his right arm toward the viewer. Holding this exaggerated pose, his back sways and his stomach pushes forward; his entire body presses up close to the surface of the picture.Ducreux was interested in the study of physiognomy and frequently used his own features as a convenient means to observe various expressions. In fact, he executed dozens of similarly exaggerated self-portraits throughout his career. A contemporary critic admired this self-portrait for its warmth, color, and expression, but later critics complained about the repetition of the subject.
Roasted and peeled chestnuts were a particular delicacy in the 1700s, served as a dessert with a coating of icing in bowls such as this pair. Factories generally sold the bowls singly, though they also came in pairs as part of a dinner or dessert service.The Svresporcelainmanufactory's stock books list several different designs for chestnut bowls. For bowls with pierced decoration, such as this pair, customers would have to pay nearly twice as much as for less intricate examples. It took all the skills of the kiln manager to prevent the sides from separating or sagging each time the piece was fired. He would have fired this pair three times, once for the porcelain body and the ground color, once for the enameled colors, and once for thegilding.
Delicate scents of potpourri once escaped from the holes pierced in the lids and shoulders of these vases. Made from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer, containers for potpourri and recipes for their sweet-smelling contents first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon prevalent. Fashionable women experimented with flowers and perfumes to achieve the finest fragrances, which were sometimes left to mature for up to nine years.Jean-Claude Duplessis, the artistic director of the Vincennes Manufactory probably designed the vases, which were namedpots-pourri Pompadourin honor ofMadame de Pompadour. In 1745 she becameLouis XV'smistress and a greatpatronof the factory.The dark blue ground color, invented only three years before this pair was made in 1752, was notoriously difficult to fire. Though not admired in its day, its uneven, textured appearance is greatly favored today. The painter, Jean-Louis Morin, based theputtiscenes on designs by Franois Boucher.
This ewer and basin were probably made for display rather than for practical purposes. The vivid color of their pink ground, a new innovation in 1757 when this set was made, would have been particularly admired because it was expensive to produce and difficult to fire. The pink decoration with its gilded outlines imitates molded water lily leaves.This pair is the larger of two sizes of ewers and basins of this shape made by the SvresPorcelainManufactory, only a small number of which survive today. Scholars attribute the design of the models for this set to Jean-Claude Duplessis, the innovative head of the Svres modeling studio.
This melon-shaped vase is a fine example of the bold and innovative forms introduced at the Svres porcelain factory in the 1760s. Produced in the earlyNeoclassicalstyle, known asgot grec(Greek taste), these designs used simpler, more sculptural decoration than in the past. Architecturalmotifssuch as the acanthus spikes inset in the fluted sides of the vase replaced painted flowers and landscapes, and ground colors became richer.
In 1783Louis XVIcommissioned an impressive new dinner service for the palace ofVersailles, including this wine bottle cooler. By the time the king was executed in 1793, less than half of the proposed 442 pieces had been completed by the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. For example, of the twenty-four wine coolers ordered, only nine were ever finished. Wine coolers were placed on the table or sideboard and filled with ice or cold water to chill the wine.Both the dark, even background color and the detailed reserve scenes are of the very highest quality and indicate that this wine cooler was made for a royal client. The dark blue ground color, known in the factory archives asbeau bleu(beautiful blue), was extremely difficult to fire. Without careful application, the color became patchy and uneven in the kiln or could bleed into other areas of the design. The central reserves are carefully painted with scenes fromclassical antiquity: one illustratesHerculeswhile the other shows Mentor.The reserve  Mentor at Salentum  is from an engraving by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard, after a painting by Charles Monnet. The reserve scene  Hercules  is based on an engraving by Georg Haas, after a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre.Gildinghas been attributed to tienne-Henri Le Guay.
These coolers were designed to hold half-bottles of wine set in ice or cold water and probably once formed part of a large dinner service. With their fanciful chinoiserie scenes of gold and platinum pagodas on a black ground, the wine coolers imitate Chineselacquerwork. In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Svres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.
The Centennial Exposition of 1889 was organized by the French government to commemorate theFrench Revolution. Bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel's 984-foot (300-meter) tower of open-lattice wrought iron was selected in a competition to erect a memorial at the exposition. Twice as high as the dome of St. Peter's in Rome or the Great Pyramid of Giza, nothing like it had ever been built before. This view was made about four months short of the tower's completion. Louis-mile Durandelle photographed the tower from a low vantage point to emphasize its monumentality. The massive building barely visible in the far distance is dwarfed under the tower's arches.Incidentally, the tower's innovative glass-cage elevators, engineered to ascend on a curve, were designed by the Otis Elevator Company of New York, the same company that designed the Getty Center's diagonally ascending tram.
As he hangs suspended from two nails on the cross, the weight of the man's figure brings his torso forward. With straightened legs, a protruding belly, and taut arm muscles, every part of his body seems to strain towards the viewer. Even the cross bows forward, accentuating the tension in the position. The man's sorrowful expression suggests that Albrecht Drer intended this as a drawing of the good thief, who repented his crimes as he hung dying on the cross beside Christ.Drer made this drawing in the studio; the forms became better defined as he went over the contours, outlining the body, chest, and abdomen with a stronger stroke. He then modeled the figure in three dimensions, using a combination of thin, parallel lines, cross-hatching, and short, rapid, repeated strokes. He probably drew the cross in last, after the figure was completed. The overall level of finish shows that Drer considered this a preparatory study, a place to work out a basic pose and proportions before making awoodcut, engraving, or painting.
 It is indeed true,  wrote Albrecht Drer,  that art is omnipresent in nature, and the true artist is he who can bring it out.  TheStag Beetleis one of Drer's most influential and most copied nature studies. Singling out a beetle as the focal point of a work of art was unprecedented in 1505, when most of Drer's contemporaries believed that insects were the lowest of creatures. Drer's keen interest in nature, however, was a typical manifestation of the Renaissance. This beetle, rendered with such care and respect, seems almost heroic as he looms above the page.Drer probably made this drawing in the studio, based on quick sketches from nature and memory. The level of finish shows that he considered it an independent work of art, not a preparatory study. He used bodycolor to show volume, as in the hard, convex outer wings. Transparent washes represent light effects, such as the shadow cast by the body, which the legs raise off the ground. Seen up close, the creature's legs and spiky mandibles suggest its kinship to imaginary beasts in late Gothic depictions of Hell or the temptation of Saint Anthony Abbott.
Scholars do not know the object for which this small circular design containing a coat of arms surrounded by two branches was actually used; suggestions have ranged from a signet ring to a bookplate. The coat of arms contains a demi-fleur-de-lis at the left and a demi-rose at the right; these might have belonged either to Matthaeus Lang von Wellenburg, cardinal of Salzburg, or to the Nuremburg humanist and lawyer Lazarus Spengler. As both the arms of these men reversed the position of the rose and fleur-de-lis, Albrecht Drer could have made this design for an engraving. The trimmed flourish at the top of the sheet shows that someone cut the image from a larger sheet.
The careful and sensitive arrangement of this child's body and bedclothes, the choice of viewpoint, and the reliance upon light to create a sense of reality, individuality, and remoteness demonstrate Charles Durheim's skill as a daguerreotypist. The girl's tiny hands are clasped delicately across her middle as if sleeping, and the photograph's horizontal orientation reinforces the nineteenth-century idea of death as  eternal slumber. In the mid-1800s, it became common to use the new medium of photography to create amemento morisuch as this one. Many families commissioned photographers to record the corpses of loved ones just prior to burial.
A drunken peasant tries to steady himself, awkwardly twisting his body and staring down at nothing in particular. He appears unaware of the precarious position of the earthenware pitcher in his left hand. The peasant's intemperate state showcases Cornelis Dusart's ability to capture the human form in an unusual pose, as well as his delicate modeling of the sitter's rumpled clothes and ruddy features.Continuing the genre tradition established by his teacher Adriaen van Ostade, Dusart specialized in depictions of peasant life. Like Van Ostade, Dusart produced studies exploring variations in pose and expression of single, seated figures. But the use of red chalk--often highlighting hands and face--was Dusart's own innovation.
The delicate draftsmanship in this drawing forms an interesting contrast to a coarse subject: a tavern in which peasants engage in bawdy behavior. A handful of rough looking men gather to play backgammon, while others sit around, immensely enjoying their smoking tobacco. Men, women, and even children drink beer. Couples fondle one another in the more secluded spaces of a corner or balcony.Cornelis Dusart underscored his subjects' lewd behavior through suggestive details: rustic wooden furniture and earthenware jugs; food, pipes, and playing cards scattered about; patrons' ragged clothes and missing teeth. He used a sharpened piece of hard black chalk to draw on the smooth vellum and gray ink to define shadow areas; media that provide a light but fine rendering.The type of iconography depicted in this drawing was central to a genre of Dutch art in which everyday people are engaged in common activities. Drawings were often framed and hung, or simply pinned up, on the walls of middle-class homes. This large-scale drawing served as a finished work of art, but Dusart also made a painting of the same scene.
On thisblack-figurehydria, the Greek heroHeraklesbattles theLernean Hydrawhile a large crab nips at his foot. His companionIolaosattacks from the other side, cutting off one of the monster's heads with a harpe or short curved sword. Twosphinxesflank the handle on the back of the vessel, and floral decoration covers the rest of the vase: an ivy tendril on the shoulder and apalmetteandlotusfriezeon the lower body.This hydria is one of a small group of painted vases produced atCaerein Etruria. All these vases appear to come from one workshop, which may have had two artists. Caeretan hydriai display many of the basic elements of Greek vase-painting reinterpreted for anEtruscanmarket, using a more vivid range of colors and emphasizing the importance of floral ornament in the decoration. They are unusual in that the artist used a template for the floral decoration, a technique not otherwise known in Greek vase-painting.
This series of images of George Reynolds, Thomas Eakins's student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, comes from what Eakins called his  naked series,  studies of the human form in successive shifts of weight and posture. Each subject was photographed in seven standing positions in the following sequence:Profile, heels together, hips straightProfile, right leg bentProfile, left leg bentFront, arms behind head or back, legs straightFront, with legs bentRear, knees together, legs straightRear, left leg bentThe images were intended for use by drawing students in order to help them achieve greater accuracy in representing the human figure. Mounted together, they form a dynamic composition, with the frontal middle image creating a central axis from which the other poses seem to emanate.
Thomas Eakins stands slightly apart at the left, the master and teacher observing his frolicking students at Mill Creek near Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Eakins used this photograph, one of a series of studies featuring nude boys playing at a variety of outdoor sports, to develop his paintingThe Swimming Hole, originally titledSwimming. Seeking to associate the youths with the classical Greek ideals of physical beauty, strength, and camaraderie, he posed them in a dynamic arrangement in and out of the water, representing them as types rather than individuals. All of the young men are shown either in profile or from behind, further obscuring their individual characters and identities.
Thomas Eakins' investigations into motion grew out of Eadweard Muybridge's animal locomotion project at the University of Pennsylvania. Eakins assisted Muybridge in finding models for his motion studies, and, erecting a separate shed on the campus, Eakins began to conduct his own experiments. This photograph is one of a series of what Eakins called  differential-action  studies, which culminated nine years later in a lecture entitled  The Differential Action of Certain Muscles Passing More than One Joint.  This lantern slide image was probably used as a projected illustration during the talk. In order to demonstrate the tensile strengths of a horse's muscles, the man on the ladder balances his weight on the horse's skinned hind leg.
This somber image is as important for what it leaves out as for what it shows. The conspicuous absence of the man's wife and the children's mother and the inclusion of the elderly mammy suggest the latter's role as caregiver to the family and hence her inclusion in the family portrait.Despite the responsibility of her position, this woman was probably a slave. Her emotional separation from the family is emphasized in the group's body language: the girls lean toward their corpulent father, while the small, old woman sits just beside the small child's chair, her crossed hands in her lap revealing multiple rings that hint at familial connections of her own.
Studies made by two Dutch artists during an exploratory expedition to Brazil from 1637 to 1644 were the inspiration for this tapestry. The newly appointed Dutch governor, Prince Johan Maurits of Nassau, led a group of scientists and artists, including Albert Eckhout and Frans Post, to Brazil, where they studied and painted the unusual plant and animal life of this country. Many of the plants, fish, birds, and other animals woven in this hanging can be traced to life studies made by Eckhout and Post in South America. French artists at the Gobelins manufactory, who designed thecartoonto heighten the tapestry's impression of drama and exoticism, probably introduced other animals, such as the Indian rhinoceros and  striped horse  or zebra.
With her face bathed in soft light, the weeping Hagar turns away from the viewer and looks up sharply. At his wife Sarah's request, Abraham reluctantly cast out the Egyptian slave-maid Hagar and the son she had conceived with him, Ishmael. After running out of water in the Beersheba desert, Hagar left her dying son crying under a bush, then moved a short distance away to weep in anguish.Gerbrand van den Eeckhout represented Hagar with her vision of the angel who told her that God had heard the boy's cries and promised,  I will make a great nation of him.  Looking up, Hagar saw a well nearby, and they were saved, to become the ancestors of the Arab peoples. Hagar and the angel's torso were cut from a larger painting some time before the Getty Museum received this painting.
This is one of four identical, elaborately carved tables Charles VII had made for theKaisersaal(king's room) in the monastery of Kloster Ettal, near Munich. All four of the tables survive in museums, one in Germany and three in the United States. The Getty Museum's table displays a portrait, possibly of Charles, in the central medallion and a shield with the Austrian coat of arms on the stretcher below.Although this table was created in the 1740s when the exuberant Rococo style was fashionable, it exhibits only one Rococo feature: the asymmetrical grouping on the stretcher. The corner masks with their feather headdresses, tasseled lambrequins, curving shields, lion's paw feet, square section stretcher, and deep symmetrical frieze are all typical of the precedingRgenceperiod. Underneath the tabletop, in the center of the stretcher, two putti play with unlikely toys, a trophy of military arms and armor.
Books of hours, made especially for the private devotional practice of lay people, were one of the most important types ofmanuscriptto be made in the later Middle Ages. Although this book is elaborately decorated with an innovative scheme ofilluminationand numerous marginal figures, it was illuminated not by major masters but by their followers. With the increased demand for books of hours in the early 1400s, collaborative ventures by different artists were common in the Parisian art market.  This book was certainly made for a woman; in fact, she is depicted kneeling in prayer in theminiaturesaccompanying two prayers to the Virgin.The manuscript epitomizes the sumptuous aesthetic of theInternational styleof painting. Characteristic features include the elongated proportions of the figures, their swaying postures, and their extravagant clothing. The borders are also classic examples of the International style in manuscripts, with richly colored acanthus leaves, brilliant touches ofgold leaf, and small playful figures appearing throughout.
Situated within the shimmering golden leaves swirling on the black-inked vines of the margin are two subjects common to calendar pages for September. At right the zodiacal sign of Libra is shown as a man dressed in a blue robe and a green hat. He seems almost too small to balance the comically large scales he carries. Below, a woman cuts grapes from a vine and collects them in a basket. This is one of the labors of the months used for September, the time of year at which grapes are harvested.
In aminiatureabove the opening words of hisgospel,Saint Markis shown seated with his symbol, a winged lion. The floor's pattern alternates squares of black with a gold diamond and green with a gold circle. The rear wall is distinguished by amotifof large diamonds circumscribed in white that contain gold squares throughout, blue squares in the center, and red squares toward the border. Saint Mark, in the middle of writing his gospels, looks up at his quill pen.  Part of the book in which he writes is blank, awaiting his thoughts.
A noblewoman kneels at the feet of theVirgin MaryandChrist, who are majestically seated on a large throne before her. The woman's ermine-lined gown and elaborate headdress indicate she is a member of the aristocracy. Her appearance here, and in a similar image later in themanuscript, suggests that she may have commissioned this luxurious book. Wealthy women were importantpatronsof manuscripts, particularly those used for private devotion, such asbooks of hoursand psalters.Although books of hours were written primarily in Latin in the early 1400s, they often included a prayer or two in the owner's native language. This image appears before a prayer to the Virgin written in French, which indicates the text had special devotional meaning for her and required careful reading.
Holding achalicefull of writhing snakes,Saint John the Evangeliststands on a narrow strip of green and gold floor and against a complex red, blue, gold, and whitebackground.  The power of the man is conveyed by his size and further emphasized by the volume of his orange robe, which extends from his waist to the fluttering piece of drapery at his shoulder.  The snakes are a reference to the legend that John drank from a poisoned cup offered to him by pagan priests as a test of his faith.  The figure's power is a visual expression of the fortitude of that faith confronting evil.
Kneeling on the grass,Jobprays to God, who is shown above emerging from a star-studded cloud. The intricatebackgroundconsists of twisting golden acanthus forms on a deep blue ground.  Theminiatureaccompanies the first of several readings from theOld TestamentBook of Job. Although this was a traditional component of the Office of the Dead, at the time thismanuscriptwas madeilluminationsfeaturing Job himself were not a standard feature of the text. The first reading begins with the pleaParce mihi domine: Spare me, Lord, for my days are nothing.  What is man that you should magnify him  Or why do you set your heart upon him   (Job 7:16-21)
 Sometimes I like the idea of making a picture that does not look like a human picture. Humans make pictures which tend to be about five feet above the ground looking out horizontally. I like very fast flying insects moving all over and I wonder what their view is from moment to moment. I have made a few pictures which show that physical viewpoint. . . . The tricycle is similar. It is an insect's view or it could be a child's view. Thus William Eggleston explained the radicalperspectivehe employed in this photograph of a child's tricycle seeming to dwarf the homes and automobile in thebackground. This photograph graced the cover of the catalogue for Eggleston's groundbreaking exhibition of color photographs at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976.
An older woman stands outside a shopping center near a coin-operated children's ride--a small elephant about half her height. The woman's enormous purse rivals the elephant's platform in size. By using awide-angle lensand a close-upperspectivein this photograph, William Eggleston enhanced his subject's awkwardness. Through such distortions, it may have been his goal to make the commonplace--people and things at a mini-mall--seem out of place.As Curator John Szarkowski of New York's Museum of Modern Art observed in his introduction toWilliam Eggleston's Guide, the design of most of the pictures seem to radiate from a central, circular core.  Elevated on his stage and centered in the frame, the elephant is, absurdly, the star of this scene. Parallel lines from the shopping center's overhang appear to radiate from it, while the woman and a mailbox balance thecompositionon either side.
A dark figure stooping over to sweep a long concourse is silhouetted by the glow of fluorescent light and window illumination. Prominent lines from ceiling tiles, window panels, and a railing appear to lock him into a seemingly endless corridor. Even the brilliant flood of light does not prevent a sense of alienation. The janitor seems segregated from the rest of the world.Despite his proximity, this solitary black man seems unaware of the photographer. There is a sense of melancholy to his posture--perhaps what William Eggleston noticed most. Despite his patrician upbringing, Eggleston experienced the deep South before integration. He must have been keenly aware of the turmoil surrounding the civil rights movement, including numerous strikes and demonstrations that took place in Memphis. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis the year this photograph was made. Implied here is Eggleston's awareness of racial difference and the plight of the black worker.
William Eggleston made this image from a two-person table in a Memphis diner, the collection of shakers and condiment jars on the tabletop in front of him blurred by the camera's close proximity. Eggleston focused on an older woman having coffee at the next table, who returns his gaze. A bright stripe on the wall behind her and a nearby neon clock sign also vie for the camera's attention. The sign's message,  payroll checks cashed free,  addresses the diner's working-class patrons--a friendly message in an alienating interior.Diners are ubiquitous places, fixtures of American road culture where inexpensive food can be had quickly. The diner is also an iconic subject of twentieth-century American art; it featured in Edward Hopper's paintings of the 1930s and Robert Frank's photographs inThe Americans,published in the 1950s. Eggleston's image extends their theme of lone city dwellers sitting forlornly in harshly lit eating establishments, looking as if they are trapped there.
This plain, unassuming suburban house dominated by its television antenna could be titledAnywhere, USA.The image demonstrates William Eggleston's interest in tract housing and particularly in new Southern suburbs. This theme runs through the over two thousand photographs of his seven-year  Los Alamos  project, for which he had actually photographed all over the United States.
The body of a young girl, cropped from her shoulders to just below her knees and presented in profile, exudes all-American teenager posture and 1970s style. William Eggleston took the picture as part of his earliest series,  Los Alamos,  which he made over a seven-year period.For this print, Eggleston used color coupler printing, a quick, cheap process yielding  natural  color. From a color negative, he made a positive print on paper containing three emulsion layers of silver salts sensitized respectively to red, green, and blue. During development, he added dye couplers that joined to the silver particles to form three color layers. The superimposition of the color layers produces a full-color image.
The gleam of a single whitewall tire betrays the presence of a black car parked discreetly behind the harshly illuminated shrubbery. The wheel glares out like a disembodied eye, peering back at the photographer through the opening in the bushes. A blast of artificial light pulls some pinkish and greenish color out of the mostly black-and-white surrounding foliage.
A very tall man, his height comparable to that of a stop sign nearby, walks toward the photographer. The man's height and stiff posture echo the rigid signpost's; at left, the elongated shadows of sign and man reach along the curve of the road to a nondescript building in thebackground. In William Eggleston's minimalistcomposition, the incidental elements of the landscape--telephone poles, a fire hydrant, and the building--draw almost as much attention as this anonymous local man.Eggleston's image describes the empty, transitional, forgettable spaces between urban and rural areas of the South in the 1960s. Eggleston recorded Memphis-area neighborhoods and people as if they were the subjects of a diary, and his familiarity with them pervades his images.
William Eggleston was initially influenced by his friend Garry Winogrand's philosophy of photographing  to see what something looks like photographed,  yet his own style is rooted in a personal approach. Here, he focuses on family members. His mother appears to yawn in front of the television. Eggleston's wife--seen in extreme close-up--smiles toward the camera. Her out-of-focus face and the older woman's blurred movement add asnapshotquality. The television, a symbol of suburban domesticity, sits prominently in the living room in front of a dramatic swath of curtains.Around the time this black-and-white image was made, William Eggleston had already met his friends and colleagues Winogrand and Lee Friedlander. Eggleston was still experimenting with a style that would not be fully developed for several years--one that later flourished in the medium of color. In this early work, though, the themes and subjects of his photography were already present.
Steel blue pipes from a water treatment plant intrude into the picture frame like multi-barreled weapons. With the reference to waste and the resemblance to guns or oversized tailpipes, William Eggleston engaged both the consumerism of contemporary American culture and its infatuation with cars and guns.
Illuminated only by the solitary streetlight that appears as a starburst in the night sky, the J.A. Kelley & Co. building sits bathed in a saturated blue light like the glow from an enormous television. A vague foreboding hangs densely in the unpopulated scene. William Eggleston made the mundane mysterious, transforming an ordinary building by using color, light and mood.
In this photograph of a rainy street, made at the exact moment of twilight when there is not light enough to reflect the full colors of the spectrum, the color is barely perceptible. Yet its vague, overall greenish tint reveals more than a black-and-white print could. William Eggleston's mastery of the color medium accounts for this subtle yet highly effective rendering.
 If you take off the viewfinder of the camera, you end up looking more intensely as you walk around. When it is time to make the photograph it is all ready for you. This makes you much freer, so you can hold the camera up in the air as if you were ten feet tall... Thus William Eggleston explained the technique he devised around 1976, choosing to aim his camera at his subjects while freeing his eye to look at the scene before him rather than at a defined portion of it through the viewfinder. His images are no less precise; here he captured both detail and a sense of space in this recently trod-upon landscape.
Clear plastic bags of trash piled up on a painted brick walk silently raise issues of consumerism and waste in contemporary American culture. William Eggleston included this graphic depiction, nagging yet not unattractive, in his 1980 portfolioTroubled Waters.
Nose up and bound for nowhere, an abandoned plane sits wrecked in a Mississippi field. William Eggleston may have meant it as a metaphor for the American South, in which it came to rest--at once both proud and ruined.
After spending a few days around Oxford, Mississippi, William Eggleston explained to a friend that he had been  photographing democratically,  taking pictures  outdoors, nowhere, in nothing  of  just woods and dirt, a little asphalt here and there.  He shot farm buildings like this combination vehicle shed and barn, here capturing a color photograph so nearly monochromatic that it recalls Walker Evans's carefully composed black-and-white images of sign-plastered rural buildings.
 Something terrible has happened to this wall. It's not like it got hit by a car--you are looking up at it. How did this disastrous collision happen, and how did it get left like that  Those accidents of brutality and a kind of blunt ugliness are a thematic constant. --Caldecott Chubb, William Eggleston'spatronThere are actually two walls here, one made of red brick that has been partially knocked away to reveal the cinder-block wall behind it. Light plays across the jagged surfaces, illuminating various textures and adding a sense of drama to a subject that most passersby might overlook. To Eggleston, the mundane subjects to be found in and around Memphis are as meaningful as any high-art subject.
Five plastic monochromatic animals march across a scratched stainless surface as though on a determined mission to plunge off the edge at left. Save for a small rectangle of blue at the top center of the image, the brightly-colored plastic animals stand in stark relief against the cool, steel-gray surface. William Eggleston included this image in his portfolio14 Pictures,published in 1974, which contained a cross-section of his early photographs.
Wedged into an awkward, nearly inaccessible corner, the brightly colored  Touchdown  pinball machine seems strangely out of place in its environment. It bears the marks of a well-loved game, however, with its orange-and-cream-checkered paint rubbed away where countless knees and boots came to rest, either in triumph or frustration.
This still life of beef pies, ice cream, and  tasty taters  heaped in a freezer richly evokes senses other than sight. While offering a curious glimpse at the culinary habits of the freezer's owner, William Eggleston assumed a neutral gaze. In fact, he made art from the obvious--these are the contents of his own freezer.
Bisected by black swaths of shadow, a brown dog blends into the rich, red late-afternoon light. Like the photographer, who so masterfully captures whatever environment in which he finds himself, the dogs that frequently appear in William Eggleston's photographs are intrepid witnesses, self-sufficient and all-seeing.
In this tightly composed image of a tiled shower alive with subtle variations of green, William Eggleston demonstrated his ability for exploiting both color and scale to produce formal images that explore the artistic potential of color photography. Using 35mm Canon and Leica cameras, with a moderatewide-angle lensto exaggerate his already unusual perspectives, he works with color negative film to create images for dye transfer. This method involves a non-chemical, handmade process that promotes irregularities and strident, unnatural colors.
Though two of these children wear homemade costumes to identify their involvement in the usual Halloween festivities, it is the lurid colored light bathing the scene that most clearly communicates the holiday's supernatural origins. The purple sky and green asphalt--as improbable as they are believable--make the picture emblematic of the haunting season. William Eggleston's talent with lighting made the three unremarkable children on an empty road one of his most well known images.
These richly saturated colors come from a large-scale video screen broadcasting a football game, which William Eggleston photographed at close range. A ballet-like figure wearing the numeral56and color-distorted pants anchors the center of thecomposition, while red and white helmets and pants pop out from inky black areas surrounding the central patch of green lawn. The best of Eggleston's photographs make the most of such color oddities.
The vivid orange-brown color of this dog lapping at the muddy pool of rainwater resulted from the traditionally commercial dye transfer process that William Eggleston used. Given the non-chemical, handmade nature of the process, irregularities and unnatural colors occurred, usually to the photographer's pleasure. Eggleston used this image in his publication,William Eggleston's Guide
All but obscuring the actual building it fronts, the Greenwood, Mississippi, Moose Lodge's cinder-block facade appears like a strange permutation of its ancient pyramidal counterpart. A lack of greenery implies the original desert location rather than the wet Mississippi Delta and fails to soften the cold exterior. The narrow, dark entrance is more foreboding than inviting, but the rich, warm sunlight bathing the concrete makes the structure seem one with the earth, from which it emerged.
With directness and simplicity, William Eggleston captured the essence of a majestic and unburdened animal in a Tennessee field. Evocative of traditional pastoral portraits such asThe Piebald Horse,which immortalizes a steed roaming the cultivated fields of a Dutch country estate, this heroic image of a humble wild horse represents what was once a symbol of great nobility.
A maid's recently laundered white dress dries on a hanger beneath a tree, disturbingly evoking a lynched African-American body in the Southern states. The close association between African-American women and maid's work underlines the distinct air of foreboding that overshadows this otherwise bright image. William Eggleston emphasized the picture's slightly surreal incongruity by omitting a visible clothesline, thus adding ambiguity to the disembodied dress hanging beneath the tree.
Puddles, the litter of empty oilcans, and the disfiguring patterns of tire tracks in the ground--a bleak, toxic scene, yet somehow the warm, coffee-toned brown of muddy water and earth lends a small measure of comfort to this image. Through his careful control of color, William Eggleston transformed dirt and garbage into a unique slice of landscape.
 The Red Ceiling  is so powerful that, in fact, I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at a dye-transfer print it's like it's red blood that is wet on the wall. The photograph was like a Bach exercise for me because I knew that red was the most difficult color to work with. A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire surface was a challenge. It was hard to do. I don't know of any totally red pictures, except in advertising. The photograph is still powerful. It shocks you every time.Thus William Eggleston explained the challenge behind the neutral gaze and obvious subject matter of this photograph.
The reassuring Gulf Oil sign, a beacon to automobile travelers, dominates a nearly empty highway between Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee. The bright orange circle hovers in the center of the photograph against a stormy sky as if suspended from the intersecting electrical wires that crisscross the landscape. William Eggleston included this image in his 1981 portfolioSouthern Suite.
A rather stern but lovely young woman dressed in wedding finery stands on an expansive lawn shaded by gracious, old trees. Holding her wineglass aloft, she stares vacantly into the lens of William Eggleston's camera. An acute observer of people and their activities in his native Mississippi, Eggleston intentionally composed this picture so that she appears alone, with only empty chairs for company. But why is she alone  Where is the rest of the wedding party  Where are the guests  By thus limiting the amount of information available to the viewer, Eggleston encouraged individual viewers to develop their own interpretations of the image.
In this unorthodox study of people and landscape, William Eggleston portrayed a leisurely afternoon drive in the warmth of the Mississippi sun. Rather than remaining anonymous, Eggleston became part of this image by allowing the viewer knowledge of his position: lying on his back on the earth, feet propped up on the side of car. He included this photograph in his 1976 Museum of Modern Art exhibition and catalogue,William Eggleston's Guide.
Two blue glass fish, a bowl, and glass fruit on a highly polished tabletop form a subtle color study with a nod to southern gentility and class. Capturing a nuanced glimpse from an unlikely angle and adding a strip of strong light from the window, William Eggleston demonstrated an innate understanding of the quiet, beautifully appointed still lifecomposition.
 I am afraid that there are more people than I can imagine who can go no further than appreciating a picture that is a rectangle with an object in the middle of it which they can identify. They don't care what is around the object as long as nothing interferes with the object itself, right in the center . . . . what they really want to see is a picture with a figure or an object in the middle of it. They want something obvious. The blindness is apparent when someone lets slip the word  snapshot.  Ignorance can always be covered by  snapshot.  The word has never had any meaning. I am at war with the obvious. Thus William Eggleston described his philosophy of picture-making. Indeed, the furniture in this home seems to have been assembled expressly to achieve the kind of central focus that Eggleston decried. Yet he chose to carefully place the organ just to the right of the picture's center and to shoot from an unusually low vantage point, so that the furniture seems to loom, holding court in the space.
A contemplative cemetery angel leans against a granitesarcophagus, as if she has just emerged from the vivid blue heavens that frame her creamy, sun-warmed figure. The rosy-gray tomb and a glimpse of muted green and brown grass provide most of the other color in this image, softly balancing the intense hues of the sky.
With its puddle-and-gravel parking lot, this rural roadside market veritably shouts  on the outskirts,  where, indeed, it was made. William Eggleston often photographs highway architecture as a means of exploring the American landscape. His one-hundred-print book,Election Eve--so named because the images in it were taken on the eve of Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential election--consisted of images such as this one, taken throughout his native South. Eggleston produced only five copies of this two-volume publication.
Car culture is evident throughout this photograph, while the tracks of a railroad--once such a vital form of transportation--are almost indistinguishable. William Eggleston made this photograph in October 1976, just before the presidential election. The image is part of a series of photographs documenting the area in and around winning candidate Jimmy Carter's hometown, Plains, Georgia.
Clumps of trees gather along the edges of a plowed Tennessee field like earthbound storm clouds kept at bay by the discrete, orderly rows. Overhead, the sky threatens some inclement weather of its own, a welcome present for the newly turned crops. William Eggleston carefully divided his color landscape into three almost equal areas of color--blue-gray, green, and brown.
A sun-soaked kitchen presents its component parts: a dish drainer, plates, cutlery, a washcloth, a roll of paper towels, and an empty orange juice carton for collecting cooking fats. The play of light on surfaces--the sink, the walls, the utensils and plate--forms the picture's main interest, and the relative lack of color, varied only from white to yellow light, heightens the scene's banality. William Eggleston often photographed such disarmingly ordinary, everyday subjects with no particular focus to thecomposition. He included this image in his 1978 artist's book,Morals of Vision.
Looking out from inside a shrimp-selling establishment, a faded orange-colored sedan offers the only evidence of recent guests. The Coca-Cola display crate in the lower right corner sits empty, and the vast parking lot is bare. William Eggleston's photograph evokes a sense of impermanence, reflecting both seasonal transience and its economic impact.
Isolated against a clear blue sky criss-crossed by electrical wires, the base of a green column wound with contrasting Christmas bulbs creates a study in color, texture, and light. William Eggleston transformed the mundane into the curiously dramatic, including just a glimpse of a drab parking lot and shopping center peeking cautiously around either side in the lower corners to confirm the banal setting.
Behind a grove of trees, a building looms imposingly. The painting depicts a story taken fromHomer'sOdyssey, in which the sorceress Circe encounters the warrior Ulysses. Descending the palace stairs on the left, Circe greets Ulysses and offers him a magic potion. Previous to his arrival, the sorceress has given the same potion to Ulysses's men, who were then transformed into wild beasts. On the right, one man sports antlers while another one nearby is horrified to find his head changing into that of a wild boar. Unbeknownst to Circe, however, Ulysses has taken an herbal antidote given to him byHermes. Ulysses will overcome the sorceress and force her to restore his men to their normal shape.The tiny figures of Ulysses, Circe, and her entourage are secondary to the magnificently decorated palace, the lush landscape, and the assortment of lively animals. The painting is a collaborative effort of two painters: theFlemishartist Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, a specialist in depicting architecture, painted the palace and garden house, while the German artist Carl Borromus Andreas Ruthart was responsible for thenaturalisticdisplay of animals in theforeground.
With an expression of longing, Saint John the Evangelist gazes upward to heaven, gesturing with his right hand. Broad folds of drapery clothe his long body. An angel swathed in flowing drapery flies behind him, sketched freely with severalpentimenti. El Greco used long, free lines to create rich patterns of form and then applied broad strokes ofwashas veils. This loose sketch, one of only three accepted drawings by El Greco, is typical of his free-flowing style with its rich interplay of light and dark. He made the drawing as a preparatory sketch for a painting of theCrucifixion.
Isolated atop a mountain, a gaunt, tormented Christ dominates a nearly empty landscape. On a road leading to the walled city of Jerusalem, horsemen pass by the execution hill, literally turning their backs on Christ. El Greco's use of dramatic colors and exaggerated proportions distorts the figure, conveying the transcendent moment when Christ sublimated his physical pain and commended his spirit to God. Turning his eyes upward toward heaven, Christ looks away from the bones and skulls that lie at his feet, representative of his triumph over death. Light plays across his undulating form, illuminating his tortured body against the dark background. To heighten empathy between the viewer and Christ, the elongated but graceful figure appears alone. This private, devotional image was meant to encourage contemplation and spiritual reflection.Few paintings by El Greco can be entirely attributed to the artist himself, rather than his workshop. Scholars conclude that the bold handling of paint on this canvas, which includes undulating contours and vigorous dashes, confirms that El Greco painted it himself. Purchased by a Spanish family at a flea market around 1950, it remained in their possession until recently.
Graceful posture, a firmly set jaw, and dark, piercing eyes reveal the proud character of this subject. His sense of dignity is underscored by the way in which he is shrouded beneath a simple cloth as if it is a stately robe. William Ellis made this image while a missionary stationed in Madagascar. His Westernbackgroundis evident in the obviously staged setting reminiscent of an English portrait studio, which includes a curtain pulled to one side and a decorative vase. While Ellis's portraits of the Malagasy people convey his sincere interest in those to whom he ministered, they also point to the striking contrast between two dissimilar cultures.
Against a sketchy landscape with a distant city in the lower left, the young Saint Agnes holds a lamb, symbol of her  marriage  toJesusChrist, the Lamb of God. The freedom and rhythm of this drawing, with its loose strokes and inkywashes, all focus attention on Agnes's embracing gesture. A prolific draftsman, Adam Elsheimer often covered both sides of sheets with varied figures and themes rendered with his characteristically dynamic energy. Scholars generally connect the Saint Agnes drawing on therectowith a series of saints that Elsheimer painted on copper panels. He may have drawnSaint Agnesas a study for a panel in the series that was either lost or never made. Theversoincludes zigzag and tangled pen flourishes and a forcefully drawn study of a muscular nude and a reclining figure shown in sharpperspective. The abrupt cropping of the figures indicates that Elsheimer cut down and reused a larger sheet when he drewSaint Agnes.
Initially published as a limited-edition photogravure, this photograph of a man and a woman in a rowboat subsequently appeared in Peter Henry Emerson's first book,Life and Landscape on the Norfolk Broads.Emerson preferred book or album presentation so that text could accompany the image. He advocatednaturalismin photography, which meant that he believed photographs should represent nature as truthfully as possible without manipulation by the photographer. Emerson's writings indicated his passion for photography. He declared:   ...we must first see the picture in nature and be struck by its beauty so that we cannot rest until we have secured it on our plate.... He derived his subject matter from rural life in the marshy, coastal region of East Anglia, northeast of London. The book features images of laborers, and this peaceful scene is no exception: as the man rows, the woman gathers flowers to use as bait for fishing. Water-lilies were placed in a large bow net, like the one behind the oarsman in this image. The bow net was then sunk to trap tench, a fish common to these waters. Emerson sought a moment of tender beauty as the woman reaches into the water to collect a blossom.
Salome presents her stepfather King Herod with the head of Saint John the Baptist, while the king offers the saint's tongue to his wife Herodias. Overcome by the beautiful Salome's skill as a dancer, the king had promised to grant her anything she wished. To take revenge on the Baptist, Herodias told her daughter to ask for the saint's head on a platter.Using a contemporary Renaissance setting, Cornelis Engebrechtsz. placed the king and queen on a raised platform with a dog gnawing a bone at their feet. Both women wear long, flowing dresses with tightly fitted bodices and elaborate headdresses to show their nobility. An ornate salt cellar sits on the table in front of Herodias. Engebrechtsz. conveyed the scene's emotions in the figures' subtle facial expressions: Salome gazes stonily forward at the king and queen, Herod appears displeased, and Herodias hesitates, perhaps drawing back into the corner. The artist used prominent painterly white highlights on the gowns, and his hatching technique imitated contemporary woodcuts. White bodycolor heightening indicates both the lighting and the volume of the forms with quick, fluid strokes.
 Be glad that you have come  reads the Greek inscription encircling this Roman mold-blown glass cup. This common expression urging the drinker to enjoy the moment is typical of the friendly exhortations found on early Roman cups. Glass vessels decorated with inscriptions were extremely popular in the first century A.D. and were found throughout theRoman Empire. An artisan made this cup by blowing glass into a baked clay mold, a technique that originated in the first century A.D. in the area of Roman Palestine. This technique allows the mass-production of identical vessels. At first, the new technique was employed to produce ornate vessels, but simple forms were soon manufactured as well.
James Ensor made this drawing as apreparatory studyfor the centerpiece drawing--about ten times larger than this sheet--of a series of five drawings and one painting that he exhibited in 1887 in Brussels with Les XX. He might also have used this drawing as part of atriptych, flanked on each side byChristShown to the People and Christ Ascending to Heaven.With these early drawings, Ensor became increasingly preoccupied with portrayingJesusChrist. He began exploring the theme of Christ's entry, which evolved into his enormous painting,Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889.Ensor used graphite to outline all the elements of this complexcomposition, emphasizing special areas with Cont crayon. His lively linear technique imbued the whole scene with tumultuous energy. He used a similar technique to establish the main masses, drama, and focus of the scene on theverso, sketching a subject that he may have contemplated including in the series.
James Ensor took on religion, politics, and art in this scene ofChristentering contemporary Brussels in a Mardi Gras parade. In response to the Frenchpointilliststyle, Ensor usedpaletteknives, spatulas, and both ends of his brush to put down patches of colors with expressive freedom. He made several preparatory drawings for the painting, including one in the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection.Ensor's society is a mob, threatening to trample the viewer--a crude, ugly, chaotic, dehumanized sea of masks, frauds, clowns, andcaricatures. Public, historical, andallegoricalfigures along with the artist's family and friends made up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the center of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functioned as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed--a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littr, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton leading on the eager, mindless crowd.After rejection byLes XX,the artists' association that Ensor had helped to found, the painting was not exhibited publicly until 1929. Ensor displayedChrist's Entryprominently in his home and studio throughout his life. With its aggressive,painterlystyle and merging of the public with the deeply personal,Christ's Entrywas a forerunner of twentieth-centuryExpressionism.
Reclining on a couch, an older balding man tilts his head back and sings, accompanying himself on the lyre. Several features of the scene, such as the couch, the pillow, and especially the wreath the man wears, reveal that he is a participant at a symposion or drinking party. Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use at such parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of revelry and drinking. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented problems for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to fit upright figures in this limited, curving space. Artists devised different solutions for this problem: some drew a line across the circle to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. On this vase, Epiktetos came up with a creative solution. He drew a line across the circle but made it the man's couch, rather than a ground-line. The edge of the man's mantle slipping down behind and below the line, creates the impression of depth and space. Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it.
A youth leans over to adjust the heel strap of his sandal, supporting himself on a staff. The precise identification of this figure is unclear: the youth may represent some mythological figure for whom sandals are meaningful, such as Theseus or Jason, or he may be a generic youth engaging in an everyday activity. The pose of this figure, standing but leaning over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C., yet this carver's skill in depicting a three-quarter view of the youth and in rendering the musculature in detail set this gem apart.Scarabs were pierced and generally worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the beetle side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When serving as a seal, the ring was removed, the scarab swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax placed on an object to identify and secure it.Greek gem carving changed dramatically in form, materials, and technique in the-mid 500s B.C. One of these changes was the introduction of the scarab, with its back carved like a beetle and its flat surface an intaglio. The scarab form ultimately derived from Egypt, where it had been used for seals and amulets for centuries. Certain features of Greek scarabs, however, such as the form of the beetle and the hatching around the intaglio motif, show the influence of Phoenician models, which the Greeks probably saw on Cyprus.
A youth bends over to scrape his shin with a curved blade called a strigil. After training, Greek athletes coated themselves in oil and used a strigil to scrape off the sweat, oil, and dirt. In part because it fills the oval space well, the pose of this figure, bending over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C. The difficult three-quarter view of the youth, the rendering of the musculature, and details such as the duck's head decorating the end of the strigil, however, display this artist's unique skills. The frequent depiction of athletes on gems of the late 500s B.C. reflects the interests of the men who owned them.A scaraboid is a simplified scarab. Rather than being carved as a beetle, the curved side of the stone is left plain. An intaglio design decorates the flat side. This scaraboid form gradually replaced the scarab in Greece in the 400s B.C.Scaraboid gems were pierced and worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the curved side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When needed as a seal, the ring was removed, the gem swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax to identify and secure property. The ring in which this scaraboid is set is modern. As small, personal items, gems were easy to carry; although this example was made in the Cyclades, it was found in Sicily.
A colorful, patriotic study in red, white, and blue, this family portrait offers an homage to Walker Evans's Depression-era depictions of hard-working families in rural Alabama. Mitch Epstein made this photograph of a family in Ybor City, Florida, as part of his 1980s series on East Coast vacation spots, from Martha's Vineyard to the Florida Keys.
This image of an automobile windshield transforms the implied violence of shattered glass into lacy spider webs of brilliant light. In contrast to the visual noise of the reflections, a small Bible sits silently open. In a recent project,The City,Mitch Epstein focused for the first time on his hometown of New York City. Rather than strictly documenting the city, this series shows the transcendent aspects of ordinary scenes. Through his elevation of such banal details, Epstein has carved his own distinctive niche in the vast, intimidating history of New York photography.
When framed within the border of a photograph, subjects as seemingly mundane as a shop door can assume a mythic character. To emphasize the revelations found in a local neighborhood, Mitch Epstein focused his project of the 1990s,The City,on New York City, his hometown, rather than traveling to distant places like India and Vietnam as he did in the 1970s and 1980s. Taking this photograph around the corner from his house, he documented his community while demonstrating the extraordinary aspects of everyday scenes.
A young athlete squats with his hands on his knees and his weight on the balls of his feet. The object hanging behind him is anaryballos, a vessel for scented oil used for bathing after exercise. Although there is no fulcrum, the slanting line under the youth has been interpreted as a seesaw; thus the scene would show a feat of balance. Scholars call this vase shape a type ofoinochoe, which usually means a pouring vessel or jug, rather than a cup. In this instance, however, the vase is a mug that was used for drinking, ladling, or measuring liquids.Because of imperfections in its manufacture, this mug helps illustrate how Greek vases were decorated. In most workshops, the master painters would paint the figures and a small strip of glaze around them. An apprentice would then cover the rest of the vase with glaze. On this example, the apprentice carefully dipped most of the cup into a bucket of glaze, except for the side with the figure. He then set out to fill in the area around the figure with brushed-on glaze. However, the glaze he used for this final step was too dilute, so it did not turn a solid black when the vase was fired.
Scenes of reveling men and youths cover this Athenianred-figurekylixor cup. On the interior of the cup, a youth holds out his kylix to be filled by a bearded man holding anoinochoeor pitcher. A volute-krater, the vessel that would have held the mixture of wine and water favored by the Greeks, stands behind the youth, and the front legs of a chair appear behind the man. The party continues on the exterior of the cup. Men and youths converse, play musical instruments, drink, and dance. The revelry depicted on this cup was fitting decoration for a vessel designed to be used at a symposion, or aristocratic drinking party.The cup was broken and repaired in antiquity. When the stem of the cup snapped, elaborate measures were taken to fix the vessel, attesting to how much the owner valued it. A thin sheet of bronze, only as wide as the interior diameter of the cup stem, was welded onto a bronze disk, which fit snugly into the opening at the base of the stem. When this device was in place, the mender drilled a hole through the stem of the cup and the bronze sheet within, above the line of the break. He then threaded a bronze pin through these holes to anchor the pieces together.
A young man holding a lyre made from a tortoise shell decorates this Athenianred-figurelekythos. He stands resting one hand on a walking stick and wearing only a mantle wrapped over one shoulder. Aristocratic Greek youths were trained in a variety of skills. In addition to athletic training, boys were taught the less strenuous arts of music and poetry, which were considered essential for well-bred youths to master.Although scholars do not know for certain where this vase was excavated, it was probably one of the huge number of painted vessels exported to Italy in antiquity. AnM-shaped graffito scratched under the foot of the lekythos was a trader's mark, used to identify goods in shipment. The same graffito is found on ahydriaby the Eucharides Painter found at Cumae in Italy, suggesting that the lekythos was traded to Italy, too.A lekythos was a vessel used to store and pour precious oil. The design of the vessel, with its narrow neck and bowl-shaped mouth, helped conserve this expensive commodity.
A boy plays the double flutes for a young reveler on this Athenianred-figurekalpis. Several clues--the provision basket hanging on the wall, the wreath on the youth's head, and the boy's red ribbon--indicate that the action takes place at a symposion or aristocratic drinking party. The youth, who is shown as just old enough to grow a downy beard on his cheeks, holds a walking stick and the case for the boy's flute.  He approaches the boy with a hand lowered toward his genitals, the standard gesture of young men courting boys. The inscription on the vase also refers to this Athenian cultural practice of men courting boys. A kalos inscription between the figures reads  Eucharides is beautiful.  Eucharides would have been one of the handsome adolescents in Athens in the years around 480 B.C., and the Eucharides Painter received his name from his fondness for this boy. A kalpis is a rounded variant form of ahydriaor water vessel. Greeks always drank their wine mixed with water, and a vessel like this one would have held the water at a symposion. The decoration on the vessel foretold the pleasures of the evening.
Only a few small fragments survive of what must once have been a magnificent red-figure calyx-krater. The fragments preserve part of Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and a decorative border ofpalmettes. Euphronios portrayed the goddess wearing a helmet and looking to the left. One arm is extended and covered by her aegis, her protective cloak edged with snakes.Partially preserved inscriptions written in thebackgroundprovide clues as to what the original scene on the krater might have been. They probably name Athena andPerseus, the Greek hero, indicating that the krater depicted Perseus, accompanied by hispatrondeity Athena, decapitating thegorgonMedusa.Euphronios worked in the newred-figure technique, which allowed painters greater ability to render realistic and three-dimensional representations of the human body. One element that allowed this was the fact that in red-figure the artist could draw interior details of figures either with dilute, normal, or thickened glaze, thereby giving them a sense of shading andmass. As can be seen here inAthena'shair, the dots of thick glaze standing up from the surface of the vase give the decoration a literal as well as visual three-dimensionality.
This cup is one of the earliest vessels made that still preserves its white-ground interior. A large vase-painting entirely fills the inside of the bowl. It is rimmed by an offset black lip; the exterior of the cup is also black.Dionysos, shown to the left and dressed in a flowing whitechitonand himation, is painted inred-figureoutline upon the creamy white ground. Details, such as the folds of his linen garments, have been rendered in dilute gloss. The curly locks of the god's long hair and hiskantharosare both painted black. Asatyrplaying an aulos approaches Dionysos from the right. Contrasting formally and iconographically with the ideal white god, his bestial acolyte is painted completely in theblack-figure technique. Thus, the satyr's anatomical markings are rendered by incision, rather than drawn with gloss.Because Dionysos was the god of wine, his activities were typically set in vineyards. Here, the grapevines are outlined byrelieflines and colored with golden dilutewash. The bunches of grapes that hang from the vines are rendered in relief. Such three-dimensional grapes, common in LateArchaicred-figure vase-painting, are unprecedented in white ground representations.A pioneer in the development of the red-figure style of vase-painting, Euphronios seems to have turned to potting later in his career. By the variety of shapes with which he is associated, we know that he potted vessels of exceptional size and complexity, including vases that combined the wheel-thrown, mold-made, and hand-formed techniques.
Through the great equalizer of time, a once-fashionableporcelainmannequin's head is wedged in amongst a smattering of utilitarian household objects in a second-hand shop window display. Probably a milliner's display head sporting a chic, bobbed hairstyle, the ceramic face stands in silent witness to the cluttered fate of the culture's cast-offs during the Great Depression. Walker Evans was frequently drawn to such incongruous, surreal scenes, in which an unlikely element appears out of its original context and thereby assumes a new relationship to the objects around it.
In the spring of 1927, Charles Lindbergh made a solo nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. That same spring, a young Walker Evans returned to New York after more than a year studying in Paris and found himself in the midst of one of the biggest public celebrations that New York had ever seen. An estimated three to four million people turned out for the pageant to mark Lindbergh's triumphant return.Evans titled a variant, less-cropped print of this imageWaiting for parade to start   Downtown   Lindbergh Day, indicating that this image was made as band members assembled before the ticker tape and confetti parade honoring the new American hero. In anticipation of Lindbergh's triumphant ride through the streets of Manhattan, scraps of paper already litter the street. Evans's photograph presents a subdued view of the calm before the storm.
Manhattan in the 1920s was a dynamically changing landscape that embodied the termModernismat every turn. Photographers sought to capture that energy and spirit by focusing on the architectural activity that was daily transforming the New York skyline and setting a precedent for the rest of the world to emulate. In this view, Walker Evans eliminated any reference to sky or horizon by pointing his camera down upon the towering structures, suggesting that he occupied an even loftier perch in some even higher building.
When Walker Evans photographed Coney Island during the height of its popularity at the end of the 1920s, it featured three amusement parks and numerous sideshow attractions, penny arcades, and game booths to entice and entertain visitors. Evans's choice of a close-up view of this growling winged monster at the park animates the creature, bringing its fabricated ferocity to life. The figure adorned the entrance to a thrill ride as a visual warning of the presumed terror within.
Made atop the twenty-story U.S. Rubber Company building then at Broadway and Fifty-seventh Street, this image of the infrastructure of several huge, rooftop neon signs was published in 1930 in the short-lived magazineUSA.Captioned  Sky Webs  as a comment on the spider web-like complexity and geometry of the intersecting beams and wires, the skeleton grid of the enormous signs counterbalances the curvilinear shapes of theU.S. RUBBERsign, seen forward and backward.
Lounging in a doorway near the docks, a longshoreman attempts to catch a few minutes away from the bustle, though the intrepid Walker Evans managed to capture this private moment of repose. The man looks intently ahead, poised as if waiting for someone or something to disrupt his pause. Worn, grimy overalls speak of the physical labor performed by the man, whose large frame fills the doorway. A cap pulled low over his brow masks his expression, providing him with some modicum of privacy against the camera's querying eye.
The bright sun delineates every architectural detail in this claustrophobic view of the urban landscape. Construction cranes and pulleys cut across the right corner of the photograph, revealing the ever-changing face of Manhattan. A faint sliver of sky attempts vainly to insinuate its presence against the solid black shaft of architecture at left. The small scale of the contact print--about two-and-one-half inches square--contributes to the sense of enclosure in the scene.
Judging by the small size--1 9 16 by 2 5 16 inches--of this contact print, Walker Evans cropped this image to focus more closely on this detail of a crane's neck seen against several buildings. Photographed from below, the machine appears to be the same size as the buildings it, or another crane, helped build. The complexity of the diagonally intersecting girders balances the plain uniformity of the windows, as the whites and grays of the architectural forms set off the cold, black steel.
In this view of the International Telephone Building, Walker Evans took the geometry of the architecture and, through careful cropping, created a two-dimensional grid of parallel lines leaning perilously skyward toward an unseen convergence point. The buildings appear to bend toward one another, giving a claustrophobic sense of the closeness of urban high-rise living. A narrow strip of sky at the left is encroached upon on three sides, barely maintaining its blank white presence against the formidable towers.
 Under thy shadow by the piers I waited;   Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.   O Sleepless as the river under thee,  wrote poet Hart Crane in his epic ode to the Brooklyn Bridge, titled simplyThe Bridge. Although this was not one of the three Walker Evans photographs that illustrated the 1930 edition of Crane's work, this image could easily have been made with the above passage in mind. Evans positioned himself beneath the bridge, shooting up at the structure at a skewed angle that distortsperspective. The sweeping underside of the roadway dominates the frame, its imposing blackness an ominous focus beside the familiar arch of the upper bridge.
Coney Island became a getaway synonymous with freedom and escape from the societal restrictions of early twentieth-century life. Lovers flocked to the attraction to frolic and become lost amidst the crowds and displays that were much more daring than they.Walker Evans photographed this couple from behind as they held each other and looked out over the water toward the famous central tower at Luna Park, one of the resort's amusement parks. The plunging back neckline of the woman's soft summer dress and her bare, tanned arms evoke collective memories of leisurely seaside idylls and hours spent in another's arms, doing nothing more than stealing moments to pause and dream and enjoy the long hot days of the season.
This is perhaps Walker Evans's most classic view of the Brooklyn Bridge. It shows the famous arches built of New York limestone and Maine granite, dissected by a jumble of intersecting cables. A solitary pedestrian appears as a mere white speck against the towering structure.Built between 1869 and 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was at the time the world's largest suspension bridge and the first to use steel as cable wire. A symbol of progress in the Industrial Age, it also became a favoritemotiffor modern painters and photographers.
In 1930 Walker Evans's friend and neighbor, the poet Hart Crane, published his epic poemThe Bridge. Three of Evans's photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge, including this view, illustrated the deluxe edition of the poem. Made underneath the bridge looking toward the Brooklyn skyline in the distance, this photograph captures a tugboat chugging along its path on the East River. From this Modernistperspective, the inverted triangle of the bridge looms large and black overhead, like a menacing funnel cloud of progress dominating urban life.
Less a photograph of the Brooklyn Bridge than of the view from it, this image shows lower Manhattan just across the East River framed by crisscrossed steel suspension cables. The geometric cage of intersecting lines dissects the financial heart of the city, emphasizing the divide between the two New York City boroughs. Walker Evans's view hints at the separate and uneasy relationship between the two worlds connected by the bridge.
In 1930Creative Artjournal published this Walker Evans photograph to accompany architect Frank Lloyd Wright's essay on  The Tyranny of the Skyscraper.  Captioned  What beauty the whole has is haphazard,  this view encompasses a hodgepodge of architectural styles littering the skyline yet holding together in a tightly choreographed dance. The Lincoln Building, with its crenellated tower, appears in the center, literally eclipsed by the towering structures surrounding it, which cast it into deep shadow. At the lower left, a sliver of sunlight picks out two crane ladders, emphasizing their pivotal role in the work at hand.
Walker Evans enjoyed pointing his camera down, photographing traffic signs and directions painted on asphalt. In this photograph, he still pointed his lens downward, but he shifted his subject to another often-overlooked part of the landscape--railroad tracks. Many other photographers in the 1920s and 30s celebrated the abstract qualities of locomotives, but Evans remained more interested in exploiting the rhythmic pattern of the tracks.
A heart, a child's arm, and an adult's arm dangle alongside a variety of votive candles for sale, which would be burned by the devoted as part of a prayer for the afflicted body part. Signs for soda, candy, and ice cream at an adjoining shop speak to the eclectic nature of shops along this New York avenue, while lines of laundry hang like flags from the tenements in the distance.
This bird's-eye view of a Manhattan street corner turns normalperspectiveon its head. Two pedestrians approach the curb, greeted by the long shadow of someone crossing in the other direction. The street is cast in deep shadow, as though the edge of the earth encroaches upon the figures.This image was published in 1929 inHound and Horn, a literary journal that Lincoln Kirstein founded while he was an undergraduate at Harvard University. Walker Evans was a frequent contributor.
The verticality of this print emphasizes the upward progress of the Lincoln Building under construction. Rather than the fifty-three story, one million square-foot building itself, the crane used in its construction is the focal point of this picture. Smaller cranes anchor the central axis of the composition, whose subject is not so much the specific building once called an  aristocrat among New York office buildings  as it is the mechanics of its erection.Walker Evans made at least half a dozen views of this particular construction site.
Anonymous and fleeting, this photograph zooms in close on a woman in round glasses clutching folded newspapers under her arm. Made on the street in New York, it epitomizes Walker Evans's preferred style of urban portraiture. With the top of her head slightly cut off and her upper body caught at an askew angle, the elderly subject in her polka-dotted dress and beads blends into the jumbled visual landscape of advertisements for eggs and tennis rackets. The arched strain of her neck as she glances away mimics the tension of city living.
Photographed under the stairs, the blank, characterless windows of Wall Street seem to personify a dreary existence within. Harsh shadows and steel beams intersect the facade and isolate the faceless pairs of openings like uniform, gaping black holes leading into a void. Visually, Walker Evans created a graphic composition of almost pure whites and blacks, with an occasional gray shadow providing little respite.
Like some cold, distant metropolis of the future, Manhattan is embodied here by a stand of skyscrapers against an ominous sky. A lone billow of smoke, the fuel used to run the urban machine, ascends from the shadows. No human or natural element softens the experience of this modern city, which Walker Evans photographed at the end of the 1920s. Ever taller, bigger, and more imposing skyscrapers transformed the urban landscape in this decade.
 We are building a new and Great[er ] Bloomingdale's  proclaims the scaffolding sign at the site of the retailer's flagship department store at Fifty-Seventh Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. Alongside the teaser is a mural of a worker puffing away on a cigarette as he catches a falling bolt in a cone, simulating the activities of the actual construction site. In the painted version, people mill about on the sidewalk below him, imitating the urban parade filing by on the real New York street.The pair on the street, however, do not appear to be the least bit interested in the imminent arrival of the upscale store. Walker Evans captured the dichotomy between advertising and reality inherent in modern city life.
Inscribed with the notationShown in the exhibition of photographs   for Commerce Industry and Science   of the National Alliance of Art   and Industry,this photograph shows an electric billboard for a movie theater beneath another, hawking cigarettes, being erected in Manhattan. Workers on pulleys glide up and down the facade, assembling the massive advertisements for the latest theater offering the newest talking spectacle out of Hollywood.
The erection of the Coney Island Boardwalk in 1923 was precipitated by the rapid influx of visitors by subway three years earlier. A three million dollar wooden structure, eighty feet wide and half the length of the resort, it became the perfect promenade from which to see and be seen.It also proved to be a valuable observation deck for Walker Evans, who photographed this smartly dressed woman leaning over the rail watching the throngs on the beach below. The patterned fabric of her two-piece ensemble looks like clusters of balloons, providing a joyous anchor for the image.
Her face a stern and graphic mask poised against the urban bustle, this unidentified young woman wearing a smart cloche hat and fur-collared coat stands against a glass shop window, intently gazing toward the street and waiting. Only a few feet beyond her, pedestrians hurry back and forth along the boulevard, yet she remains a pillar of calm and steel, her furrowed brow at once a defense mechanism and an expression of vulnerability. Engrossed in thought, she appears to be entirely unaware of Walker Evans's presence.
This photograph was first published in 1930 in a portfolio of Walker Evans's work,  New York City,  inHound and Horn, Lincoln Kirstein's literary journal at Harvard University. As the first plate, titled simplySixth Avenue, it was an anonymous image of a pedestrian caught by chance in the midst of city traffic.Evans favored this sort of street portrait throughout his career. He brazenly closed in on this stranger, whose weary face is framed in an abundant fur collar. Evans's goal was to record a glimpse of random faces against the chaos of crowds, automobiles, and mass transit. In this view, the entrance to the elevated train dominates the right edge of the picture.
The street was where Walker Evans worked--along Broadway, in Wall Street, around Central Park, on the Bowery, over in Brooklyn, up in the Bronx. French photographer Eugne Atget and American Paul Strand provided part of Evans's inspiration, but his art finally came from life, from the everyday life of the streets.Evans was after  a type in the street, a 'snapshot' of a fellow on the waterfront, or a stenographer at lunch.  On the street, where most of New York living takes place, a street vendor stands, peddling his wares. His portable case is slung over his right shoulder, and he lists slightly to that side, literally swayed by the weight of his labor.
Coney Island, in the southern part of Brooklyn, New York, became the world's largest and most popular amusement area with the arrival of the subway in 1920. For five cents a trip, poor city dwellers could escape the summer heat and enjoy a getaway that had previously been reserved for the upper and middle classes. In 1923 the beach was opened to the public, and up to one million people thronged the shores on holidays. An intrepid observer, Walker Evans captured a personal detail on the crowded sands: a woman standing amidst a sea of bodies, shaking sand from her towel.
 They say the neon lights are bright On Broadway   They say there's always magic   In the air,  go the lyrics to the popular song by composers Lieber and Stoller. They could easily have had this photograph by Walker Evans in mind when they penned those famous opening lines.The dazzling overlay of lights weaving in and out of one another captures the vibrancy of the modern city at its electric best. Achieved by means ofphotomontageusing several negatives, the photograph eliminates all conventional spatial relations as the visual cacophony of marquees heralds the various entertainments.The Big House, whose bright lights anchor the composition, was a hard-boiled, Academy Award -winning prison drama.
One of the more curious, albeit common methods of advertising in the first half of the twentieth century was the signboard, attached by straps to the chest and back of an employee. The worker would then walk around wearing the board, and the message or advertisement would reach any and all who crossed his path.Surely Walker Evans found particular interest in such an advertisement for his own field of work. Furthermore, his ongoing appetite for words and language in signs was no doubt whetted by this mobile example.
Walker Evans transformed these monuments into flattened geometric patterns or building blocks, here using a bird's-eye view and eliminating the horizon line.
Conceived by automobile magnate Walter Chrysler as a gleaming monument to theMachine Ageand his contribution to it, the seventy-seven story Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan was--for only a year after its 1930 completion--the world's tallest building. The 1920s saw the proliferation of skyscraper erections in Manhattan, and Walker Evans photographed the most celebrated of them.Only partially completed, the famous thirtieth-floorfriezeof abstract automobiles on the Chrysler is visible at the image's center. Rather than focus upon its 1,046-foot verticality, Evans positioned himself looking down on the construction, as raw materials were transformed into an architectural vision. Thisperspectivehighlights the diminution of the other buildings around it, conveying the impressive scale of the structure.
Walker Evans was attracted to all things uniquely American, and this structure's mixing of architectural styles without regard for historical accuracy was certainly an American phenomenon. This bizarre house probably appealed to Evans because of its distinctive combination of Gothic Revival and Greek Revival elements. Obviously Gothic Revival, two large, side-by-side arches span the porch, echoed by the small arched window on the upper facade, complete with pointed shutters. The Greek Revival fluted columns supporting the upper story's porch appear inconsistent, suggesting that this home may have been altered in an attempt to adopt a more fashionable style.In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Americans typically looked to catalogs and pattern books to determine the style in which they should build their homes. They often drew from various sources, choosing whichever elements they fancied. This eclecticism was especially appealing to Evans, whose quest for the typical often involved the many places Americans called home.
Photographed through a large plate window, these three diners appear engrossed in getting a fast bite to eat, entertained all the while by the activity on the street. Only the man on the right appears aware of the photographer's presence directly opposite them on the sidewalk. Assembled like afriezeacross the front of this storefront lunch counter, the men are both familiar and anonymous in their dark suits, white shirts, and ties. Walker Evans clearly enjoyed this post outside the busy lunch counter, and he stayed to photograph several other trios of unsuspecting customers.
LARGE RIPE BANANAS, FANCY BERRIES,FANCY APPLESbeckon the hand-lettered signs attached to this itinerant fruit wagon. Crates are piled haphazardly toward the back, and heads of lettuce threaten to spill over the front of the cart. A man sits on the steps behind, nearly invisible amidst the visual jumble of the traveling market. Walker Evans captured a scene of urban living at once vital in its detail of everyday usefulness and fleeting in its recording of a way of life soon to give way to supermarkets and urbanization.
A well-cared-for bureau with a gleaming, polished top and attached mirror sits displaced out on the street against a packing crate, a graffiti-covered door, and a brick wall. Further evidence of someone's moving day is reflected in the mirror: carefully wrapped and stacked chairs, the last load on the mover's truck, await the final departure. Made around 1931, this photograph by Walker Evans evokes images of the human ebb and flow caused by the Great Depression, as personal circumstances and residences changed drastically overnight.
Walker Evans claimed that he didn't consciously think about composition, but that he was  very aware of it unconsciously, instinctively.  This instinctive understanding of composition is borne out by his recognition that a tree, an automobile, and a farmhouse could be aligned in such a way as to create a perfectly balanced arrangement.The dramatic interplay of geometry is the most striking feature of this photograph of an early Ford parked alongside a farmhouse. Three rooflines dominate the composition and create a series of horizontal planes. The main building's siding underscores the horizontal, while the siding on a single-story extension emphasizes the vertical. Two brick chimneys flanking the ends of the farmhouse and curtains hanging on the lower story's windows extend the sense of verticality. A tall tree, spreading its bare branches throughout the upper half of the image, enlivens the composition, juxtaposing nature's irregular patterns with the farmhouse's formal structure.
With an unerring eye for details and signs, Walker Evans focused on this charming advertisement painted on the side of a lunch wagon. A man and woman on a lakeside outing pause to eat sandwiches in their car beneath a menu advertisingHamburger Steak and Onionsfor thirty-five cents. In the upper right is a pretty, etched-glass windowpane, a delicate touch out of place amidst the more utilitarian trappings of the itinerant restaurant.
Clearly interested in showing the human condition, Walker Evans photographed this assembly of down-and-out men lounging and sleeping in doorways on South Street in lower Manhattan. Their weary bodies are strewn across the lower half of the frame like discarded props on a stage.The advertisement for the St. George Hotel pool, posted at left and featuring a bathing beauty, was probably not meant to draw in any of these denizens of the street. A keen observer of detail, Evans was aware of the irony that the juxtaposition presented.
Virtually entirely cut off at the left edge of the photograph, a man lounges in the doorway of the corner market, a newspaper tucked casually under his arm. Although not even his head is visible, the thin slice of the photograph provides enough information to give a clear sense of his presence. Beside him on the street, a ragged, grimy man holds one sack in his hand and another on his back. With his mouth slightly open, he looks toward the street as if waiting for someone, either a ride or some other rendezvous. While the circumstances of his vigil there remain a mystery, Walker Evans's photograph quietly captures the sense of waiting and anticipation of this scene in Havana, where Evans photographed during May and June of 1933.
Taking a cigarette break from the grill, this short-order cook leans with his arm around a seated man also having a smoke just outside the diner. Both men look directly at Walker Evans in a rare posed portrait from Evans's body of work. Though their particular relationship is unknown, they greet the photographer with an easy candor and self-awareness. The sign above their heads, ever present in Evans's photographs, advertises the day's menu choices, all variations on a theme.
[Walker] Evans's style is based on moral virtues of patience, surgical accuracy and self-effacement. In order to force details into their firmest relief, he could only work in brilliant sunlight, and the sun had to be on the correct side of the streets. Often many trips to the same house were necessary to avoid shadows cast by trees or other houses; only the spring and fall were favorable seasons. The forms were sharpened until so precise an image was achieved, that many of the houses seem to exist in an airless nostalgia for the pastSo wrote Lincoln Kirstein about Evans's images when Evans had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1931 Evans traveled throughout New England photographing Victorian architecture. This study of the gingerbread, or decorative trimming, on a pump house in Kennebunkport, Maine, subtly juxtaposes clean, graphic shadows and highlights with the more fanciful ornamentation of the architecture. The lacy trimming of the overhang softens the stark, black rectangle of the doorway and the squares of the windows.
Except for certain morning shopping hours, Havana is still a largely male city. The tide of pedestrians along narrow Obispo Street, with its cavernous cool dark stores, or under the Prado portals, wall-papered with magazines and multicolored lottery tickets, the idlers in the open air cafes--nearly all are men in white linen, now and then a bright tie under a dark chin shaded by a straw hat tilted effectively.Walker Evans's photograph is the exact embodiment of writer Carleton Beals's description of Havana in his bookCrimes of Cuba. Tall, dark, and handsome in a crisp white linen suit and straw boater, this  Havana Citizen  standing down by the newsstand filled with glamorous movie magazines casts a wary glance at a subject just out of camera range. Although Evans contributed photographs he made in Cuba to Beals's book, this evocative image did not appear in the publication.
Physically together yet worlds apart, the occupants of this public park bench look behind and ahead, but not, it seems,atone another. The woman on the right appears to be engaged with someone near her, but her face is revealed only by a slim profile, not enough to indicate the focus of her attention. Bundled in overcoats and gloves, the men seem least aware of the photographer. Walker Evans in turn regarded them less as individuals than as representatives of the human condition.
Large and small painted  fist  signs, as the familiar pointing hand with extended index finger is known, leave no doubt as to the location of this used clothing emporium. Rows and clusters of shoes and stacks of neat white shirts are displayed on the street, allowing for easy perusal of the items for sale. A hand-lettered list of the available wares decorates a window partially obscured by a sagging awning. The unoccupied garments andvernacularsigns undoubtedly attracted Walker Evans to this ragtag assemblage of goods.
For a tiny structure seemingly tacked onto the end of another building, the license photo studio in New York makes much ado about its services. No fewer than six signs advertise that this is the place to have photographs for driver's licenses made, and it is one-stop shopping at that: clients can borrow a car for the road test, pick up the application, and get a document notarized besides. Walker Evans's closely cropped photograph isolates the business on the corner, transforming it into a curious box. A sign from an adjoining business at left and graffiti on the wall also make their bid for attention, but they are outnumbered and overpowered by the show of strength made by the  photos. 
Nearly obscured by the proliferation of signs advertising everything from brownies to brake linings, the Palumbo Public Ice-Fuel Corp. Truck is seen parked just inside the White House garage. Poised as if ready to roll, the delivery truck lurks in the shadows of the garage, surrounded by a handful of grinning men, who were apparently amused by Walker Evans's desire to photograph their workplace.
As the surrounding signs and lettering speak their purpose, three silent employees gather casually in and around their work truck. The Palumbo Public Ice-Fuel Company delivery truck is parked on a brick street with another Palumbo vehicle parked behind it. Probably spurred by his interest in signs and lettering, Walker Evans spied the vehicle near its headquarters and made a series of photographs of it.In another view the truck is seen parked inside the White House Garage. The pair reveals Evans's studied method of working a desirable scene from various angles.
In this photograph of a highway corner in West Virginia, signs proliferate and dominate, with no visible person to read them. The gas station, the traveler's last stop out of town, anchors the corner, a solid brick building that proudly reveals its nationalistic bent with the bold announcement that  AMERICAN GAS  is sold there. A formidable, solid telephone pole cuts vertically through the frame in the foreground while another peeks out from behind it in the distance. Wires busily intersect the sky, and a large, round sign for the telephone company announces the communication system. Despite all the evidence of devices to keep people connected, the image projects an ironic sense of emptiness and desolation.
This image succeeds as more than a document - it is a portrait of a town. A grocery store anchors the street corner like a surrogate town square. The noisy words of the advertisements, in contrast with the empty ladder, the propped-open screen door, and the quiet of the streets, give a mysterious quality to the image.Evans once aspired to be a writer, so it is no coincidence that many of his photographs feature the words of local signs. Evans probably took this photograph on assignment for theResettlement Administration, a government-sponsored project that sent photographers into rural communities during the Great Depression to document conditions there. Evans's photograph records the daily life of the place without showing its occupants.
Though Selma, Alabama is now most famous for its role in the civil-rights era, in Walker Evans's 1930s photograph of Main Street the town is a quiet place where people gather to chat outside the local Trading Post. The struggle to regain voting and citizenship rights began in this period, and African-Americans throughout the state established civic and voter leagues known as citizenship schools. Because illiteracy rates were high, ideas about voting and desegregation spread by word-of-mouth when people came together in small groups.It is difficult to know whether this topic spurred Evans to make the image. Although he was in the Deep South to photograph white sharecroppers forFortunemagazine, Evans had a habit of photographing whatever interested him. The architecture of the street and the assortment of goods on the sidewalk may have been what compelled him initially, but as a keen observer of people's habits, he was likely motivated by the individuals casually assembled in front of the store.
This is a very American view--the charm of it is in the ugliness and craziness of the architecture of different periods there together. Look at the quite handsome, charming building down front. While to the left, is a ridiculous house with a crenellated castle on it. The first is honest, the second is not honest; both are American.Walker Evans declared that he was not interested in  educated architecture,  but in vernacular styles such as those seen in this image of an industrial town. Using moral terms to compare the commercial building of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the foreground with the domestic architecture of a house in the background, Evans found the latter to be lacking in authenticity.Although architecture may have been Evans's primary interest, his inclusion of the railroad in the left-hand corner of the image added a dynamic as well as a documentary aspect to the composition. Since colonial times, New Jersey had been an important link for importing and exporting goods to New York and Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg, N.J. was one of the earliest stops on the railroad.
Walker Evans claimed that he sought out his subjects  by instinct, like a bird, entirely by instinct. Like a squirrel too, burying and hiding, and divining where the nuts are.  This photograph reveals not only that he was adept at identifying compelling subjects, but that in front of his camera his subjects were entirely at ease.People and their way of life fascinated Evans. In this photograph he captured two individuals looking away from each other, as if the presence of the other person were of no consequence. Perhaps they are a couple so accustomed to one another that there is no need for acknowledgement. Perhaps they are simply looking out toward Main Street, observing the activities of their neighbors. The couple, their habits, and the consumer products behind them represent a way of life that Evans recognized as vanishing and that he specifically set out to record.
Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, with text by James Agee and photographs by Walker Evans, was published in 1941. The book focused on three tenant cotton-farming families living in Hale County, Alabama, during the Depression. Agee invented the name  Gudger  for the book; this family's real name was Burroughs. The Burroughses hosted Agee and Evans for nearly a month, and this photograph was made at George Burroughs's request.The family sits and stands against the side of their house, dressed in their best clothing, posing for a family photograph. George Burroughs, standing at the center, does not smile; rather, he looks proud and strong, his arms extended across the shoulders of his wife and eldest daughter on either side of him. The photograph shows the Burroughses as they wished to be seen and differs from other photographs of them that express Evans's view, portraying their situation more bleakly.
Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, with text by James Agee and photographs by Walker Evans, was published in 1941. It focused on the lives of three cotton tenant farming families living in Hale County, Alabama. Frank Tengle, whom Agee called Fred Ricketts in the book, appears here in close-up, the deep, furrowed lines of his weathered face echoing the horizontal stripes of the clapboard siding on the shack against which he stands. He wears his work clothes; the stubble on his chin and oily disarray of his hair suggest that the photograph was made during or toward the end of Tengle's work day. The harsh sun against his face seems almost like an assault upon an already battered soul.
Informally seated on the porch of a small store in a Southern town as they gesture and tell tales, these two men present a quintessentially American image. Walker Evans made this image in Selma, Alabama, but for him this scene could have taken place in any small town in the South.Evans's aim was to capture the particular nature of American culture. People, vernacular architecture, storefronts, signs, and cars were some of his chosen subjects. Today these images recall a simpler time when leisurely summer afternoons were spent on porches talking with fellow townsfolk.
From mid-July to mid-September 1936, Evans took a leave from his position as an information specialist for the Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration to work with the writer James Agee on an assignment forFortunemagazine. They traveled to the Deep South to prepare an article on tenant cotton farming. In Alabama they documented the lives of farmers, including the Fields family. Evans found in this average American household the archetypal portrait of the everyman that he treasured. The straight-forward style of this portrait emphasizes the family's hard life as much as their pride.
From an elevated position, perhaps standing on a bridge or trestle, Walker Evans photographed railroad tracks receding around a bend in a small town. Several men huddle around a curb at the end of the station platform, while a solitary man carrying a package makes his way along the tracks beside a lingering snowbank. The blank gray sky, the heavy clothing on the figures, and the leafless trees in the background suggest the chill of winter. The image conveys sadness and a sense of desolation, despite the presence of people. Pushcarts sit abandoned between the tracks, and no trains stand at the station, and no passengers wait on the platform. The cars parked across from the station allude to the growing popularity of traveling by automobile rather than railroad.
Walker Evans disliked the term  nostalgic ; however, looking at this view down Main Street in Greensboro, Alabama, it is easy to understand why people use this term to describe his photographs. The two-lane street seen here is lined with charming buildings that house a barber shop, a coffee shop, a telegraph office, and the Alabama Power Company. Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper advertisements abound, while traffic is limited to a single, moving car. In the background, the commercial thoroughfare gives way to a tree-lined street, which leads to the town's rural surroundings.Evans's documentary style aimed to record the slow-paced atmosphere of small-town America, where a mere block of one- and two-story buildings provided all the commerce in this farming community.  To be interested in what you see that is passing out of history,  Evans once said,  even if it's a trolley car you've found, that's not an act of nostalgia. 
Walker Evans captured this informal image of Floyd Burroughs and his daughter Lucille at they sat on their porch in Hale County, Alabama. The man's tattered clothing and their lack of shoes demonstrate the family's economic struggle at the height of the Depression. During a month-long expedition, Evans and the writer James Agee documented the lives of three families of white Southern sharecroppers for an article inFortunemagazine. Evans photographed the interiors and exteriors of the families' homes, barns, and churches and made many portraits. Their work never appeared inFortune, but the resulting book,Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,published in 1941, became a landmark of social journalism.
We live in a part of the country that some call The Bible Belt. Most folks around here go to church regular. Many of my friends have to go on Sunday and again on Wednesday Night.These words from a thirteen-year-old boy aptly describe the area where Walker Evans photographed this church interior. Worship was and is central to the lives of many Southerners. Evans spent a month in the South with the writer James Agee, interviewing local residents and making images of their way of life for aFortunemagazine story on sharecroppers.Rather than photographing the church full of worshippers, Evans showed it empty to emphasize its bare-bones simplicity. The ornate imported organ contrasts with the homemade plank pews and unadorned window. A small sign on the wall sets out six goals for the  100 percent pupil --presumably a bible student--awarding ten points for offerings, something few actually could have made at this time. An adjacent blackboard records attendance at class, including several picturesque misspellings.
The only reason this photograph has any value is, an instinct is touched in it. . . . It's uproariously funny, and very touching and very sad and very human. Documentary, very real, very complex. All these people had posed in front of the local studio camera, and I bring my camera, and they all pose again together for me. That's a fabulous fact.Walker Evans was in the South a number of times during the 1930s. While in Savannah, he photographed this photo-studio shop front. Storefronts remained a consistent theme in Evans's work, but this image spoke to him in a particularly poignant way. Young women, servicemen, professionals, couples, children, sisters, and a father and his daughter fill the window, all tightly arranged. These were the subjects Evans sought: not celebrities in highly decorated studios but everyday people.
African Americans owned and performed the traveling minstrel show  Silas Green from New Orleans.  From 1907 to 1958 they brought jazz, ragtime, and comedy to the Southern states. Surprisingly, photography, which is expected to arrest motion, has the effect of animating this painted chorus line.
Walker Evans was born in Saint Louis and literally raised on advertising. His father, Walker Evans, Jr., began his career as an advertising agent and quickly rose to a position of copywriter, moving the family from Chicago to Toledo, Ohio, to pursue accounts. This upbringing contributed to Evans's astute observations of popular culture, particularly signs of all sorts, like this hand-painted advertisement for a dry cleaners specializing in the care of fur.Evans treasured signs as objects and collected them from street corners and antique shops. In a 1971 exhibition, he presented some of them next to their photographic representations.
For the purposes of Walker Evans's continuing quest to obtain anonymous portraits, the subway was the place  where the people of the city range themselves at all hours under the most constant conditions.  In order to remain inconspicuous, Evans used a hidden camera: a small, fast Contax that he painted flat black, strapped to his chest, and operated with a long wire strung down his right sleeve. In 1966 he published the images with James Agee's introduction as the bookMany Are Called.

Beneath the skyscrapers, bridges, and streets, New York built a subway system. Construction began in 1900, the public boarded in 1904, and by the 1930s there were 650 miles of subterranean rapid transit in operation. The cost of a ride was five cents; for the purposes of Walker Evans's continuing quest to obtain anonymous portraits, this was the place  where the people of the city range themselves at all hours under the most constant conditions. In order to remain inconspicuous, Evans used a hidden camera: a small, fast Contax that he painted flat black, strapped to his chest, and operated with a long wire strung down his right sleeve. He and the writer James Agee may have planned to collaborate on a volume of subway portraits, but Evans's concern about adverse reactions from some of his unsuspecting sitters caused him to defer this idea until 1966. This maquette of sixteen prints was assembled, but never used, for that endeavor, which he finally published with Agee's Introduction as the bookMany Are Called.
 You want [your work] to spring from life,  declared Walker Evans in a 1971 interview. For Evans, that meant finding his subjects on the street:  I found I wanted to get a type, a 'snapshot' of a fellow on the waterfront, or a stenographer at lunch.  In this photograph he captured a remarkably self-confident shopper. The woman, in a polka-dot dress, dark hat, and white gloves, looks squarely into Evans's camera. Though a good deal of her face is shaded by the hat, her serious, down-turned mouth conveys a sense that the photographer was not of interest or amusement to her.
For the purposes of Walker Evans's continuing quest to obtain anonymous portraits, the subway was the place  where the people of the city range themselves at all hours under the most constant conditions.  In order to remain inconspicuous, Evans used a hidden camera: a small, fast Contax that he painted flat black, strapped to his chest, and operated with a long wire strung down his right sleeve. In 1966 he published the images with James Agee's introduction as the bookMany Are Called.

In the 1940s, Sarasota was one of few Florida towns that allowed trailers and provided them with running water and electrical hook-ups. The community, whose population was then a mere 8,000, also built laundries and social halls for the seasonal visitor. Walker Evans made this photograph while on a six-week assignment in Florida. He was hired to illustrate the 1942 publicationThe Mangrove Coast: The Story of the West Coast of Florida,a comprehensive book detailing the geology of the region and the legends of its explorers. Most of the pictures depict the habits of what Evans called  winter resorters,  retirees who seasonally descended upon the southern vacationland.Evans was fascinated by people's homes, often photographing their interiors and exteriors. Tenements in the Deep South, Gothic Revival cottages in the north, and even mass-produced trailers like this--all were of deep interest to him.
With  Love or Leave America  emblazoned on the side of their convertible, five Italian-American women declare their patriotism in no uncertain terms. In the background, a group of African-Americans watches the festivities, unable to participate. The occasion: an Independence Day parade in 1941.For Walker Evans, who sought to photograph uniquely American subjects, this stark juxtaposition illustrated the country's conflicted pursuit of cultural diversity and segregation. Although Evans was not interested in making social statements, he was keenly aware of the disparity between the lives of those in the parade and those who watched from the sidelines.Walker Evans made this image in Bridgeport, Connecticut, many years before the civil rights movement, while on assignment withFortunemagazine. It was published in a September, 1941 article, entitled  Bridgeport's War Factories. 
Among low-priced, factory-produced goods, none is so appealing to the senses as the ordinary hand tool. . . . Aside from their functions--though they are exclusively wedded to function--each of these tools lures the eye to follow its curves and angles, and invites the hand to test its balance.Walker Evans's introduction to  Beauties of the Common Tool,  an article that appeared in the July 1955 issue ofFortunemagazine, makes clear his appreciation for the most ordinary apparatus. Photographing pliers, chisels, trowels, scissors, and bevels was a fitting assignment for Evans, who found items of everyday use intriguing. Using plain surfaces and extended exposures so that his large-format negatives would capture every nuance of texture, Evans transformed mundane tools like this crescent wrench into works of sculpture.
Although a century had passed since the railroad first came to America, it remained a popular subject for photographers. Photographs were initially used as advertisements for the railroad companies; they also educated people about the frightening  iron horse  that not only revolutionized transportation but also connected a continent. By the 1900s, photographers like Walker Evans found the peripheral, manmade materials surrounding the railroads a worthy subject. All signs, including this weathered artifact, particularly interested Evans.
Paintings by Evans are extremely rare and not widely known. This example strongly relates to Evans's photographs, most notably streetscapes from his seriesFaulkner Country, made in the late 1940s. The painting was a valuable addition to the Museum's collection of Evans's work (including more than one thousand prints), which, through its size, range, and quality, is a cornerstone of the photographs holdings. The very existence of Evans's painting demonstrates that photographers sometimes choose to give up their cameras to use traditional art materials.
Although he lived in the heart of Manhattan during the period of its most rapid urban growth, Walker Evans preferred the decrepit to the new, the traditional to the modern. The demise of the Third Avenue El in the mid-1950s and changes in zoning laws in 1960 caused blocks of that avenue to be transformed. Walking the streets, Evans photographed Third Avenue in transition, transforming bed frames and keepsake chests into street sculpture awaiting sale.
Walking the streets, Walker Evans put together a photographic series on Third Avenue in transition. In this view of a recently constructed thirty-four-story building at 750 Third Avenue, Evans made clear that a new architectural style had invaded his city and the effect on the residents was not good. A Chaplinesque figure leaving the safety of the curb seems thrown off-balance by his surroundings, his disorientation much like that of French comedian Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot trying to make his way around 1960s Paris.
Old Buttonsadvertise the window signs, but this secondhand shop on Third Avenue in New York City offers much more in its display. Rows of violins, trays of jewelry, and miscellaneous trinkets vying for attention reflect economic and social change with the encroaching reflection of the modern architecture across the street. A window shopper, his hair dusted with gray, likely recalls the past life of this avenue, represented by the shop's contents.
The demise of the Third Avenue El in the mid-fifties and changes in New York zoning laws in 1960 caused blocks of that avenue to be transformed from a street sprinkled with antique shops, bars, and restaurants to yet another anonymous boulevard. Walking the street with his camera, Walker Evans put together a photographic series, apparently planned for publication inFortune, on Third Avenue in transition. The subject matter is vintage Evans: secondhand shop displays, window shoppers, sparse trees, condemned buildings, and new construction. He always preferred the decrepit to the new, the traditional to the modern, the dated manner of antique curios to current design.
A bare winter tree, a holdout on cement-bound Third Avenue in New York City, emerges from an unlikely square of bricks, its base encased in a protective sheath. A restaurant sign proclaimingVersaillesat the upper right, next door to a secondhand store, becomes an ironic reference to the royal palace in Walker Evans's photograph. This image comes from an unpublished story forFortunemagazine. Evans worked forFortuneas a staff photographer between 1945 and 1965.
This view of Third Avenue in New York shows the juxtaposition between old and new. The quaint, pedestrian character of the old neighborhood is contrasted with the new super boulevard represented by the brand new, gleaming white median that divides the widened avenue. At left a man transverses the street, but as Walker Evans represented it, the far side is not even within sight in the frame of the photograph.
No subject was too insignificant for Walker Evans, who transformed scattered litter on a New York City street into a graphic, abstract composition of complex shapes floating in an indefinable space. The seeping stain on the grimy street becomes a textured, almost lunar surface, otherworldly yet compelling. No mundane detail escaped his eye either, as spent cigarette butts and crumpled paper stand against the gritty black ground like small pieces of sculpture.
In 1963 Walker Evans assembled a series of more than eighty pictures that he described as a  random check of all kinds of men  and declared that, except for the loyal railroad yard men, almost no one was maintaining the standards of a  classic job costume.  For Evans, the working man was now everyman, and, because so much of the population had moved into the city, every man was now the man-in-the-street. In opposition to the current men's fashion photography, Evans called his work  documentary fashion photography.

Caught in a moment of idle repose, this sightseeing tour guide appears bored and disinterested, staring blankly while two chattering women look beyond him to something catching their attention out of the camera's range. Walker Evans frequently captured his subjects unaware, in that very moment when their shoulders relax and their postures slump a little and, although in public, they retreat into their solitude, assuming no one is watching.

 After all, I am getting older, and I feel that nobody should touch a Polaroid until he's over sixty,  remarked Walker Evans in an interview the year that he died. He was introduced to the instantaneous Polaroid SX-70 camera and color film in 1972 and used it for two years, primarily making portraits of colleagues, friends, and students. Eventually he made more than 2,400 Polaroid images.In this photograph, Evans's familiar love of signs and words is evident in the cryptic message  DEAD END  that has been spray-painted on a metal sign. It is uncanny as well as ironic, given that the Polaroid camera marked a new and fruitful path in Evans's career.
The chilly letters that spell ICE on a steel background convey relief from heat on the hottest summer day. To emphasize how frosty the contents of this freezer are, the letters appear to have snow on them. Walker Evans made this picture from his personal fascination with lettering and graphic design. Throughout his fifty-year career, Evans photographed many types of signs--billboards, graffiti, theater marquees, and even traffic signs--each of which reflected his astute observation of popular culture.
Walker Evans made this picture of an icehouse on a particularly sunny day. Bold red letters--ICE BLOCK CUBES--stand out vividly against a white background. Although a large tree shades most of the vending machine, Evans took the photograph when the sun fell almost directly on its facade, creating dynamic angular shadows. Beneath a blue sky with billowy clouds in a suburban neighborhood, the ice machine evokes nostalgic memories of the ice cream vendor, an everyday presence in many American childhoods.
An assortment of commonplace white traffic arrows painted on asphalt did not escape the lens of Walker Evans, who treated signage of every type with an equal amount of attention. Letters and symbols, whether painted freehand or with stencils, were all of interest to him. He made this picture from a pedestrian's viewpoint, which resulted in a dynamic angular perspective.The photograph's snapshot-like quality betrays the camera Evans used to capture this image: the newly introduced  absolute one-step  Polaroid. The simple Polaroid camera was a liberating tool for him in his later years. Rejuvenated by this new technique, Evans claimed that it could  extend [his] vision and . . . open up new stylistic paths. 
Walker Evans, who was extremely fascinated by all types of signs and advertisements, made this photograph of a small store while on vacation in the French West Indies. The torn cigarette and candy boxes arranged along an exterior wall effectively notify potential customers of the goods obtainable therein. The proprietor of this shop used company graphics such as Coca-Cola and Marlboro in an innovative way--pasted together like a collage. The signs are vivid examples of typography and graphic design, which Evans also found fascinating.Like the images of general-store signs that Evans made in the rural South, this photograph venerates popular culture. Unlike in those early images, however, he used a Polaroid camera to make this picture. The lightweight one-step Polaroid was a convenient tool for the seventy-year old artist who was sprightly in mind but not in body. Although Evans sometimes referred to the Polaroid as a toy, he enjoyed  its simplicity as well as its color potential. 
[T]ry for a record of an emotion rather than a piece of topography. Wait till the building makes you feel intensely.... Try and try again, until you find that your print shall give not only yourself, but others who have not known your intimate knowledge of the original, some measure of the feeling it originally inspired in you.... This will be 'cathedral picturemaking,' something beyond mere photography....Thus Frederick Evans passionately explained his approach to picture-making. The whole of the soaring interior of WellsCathedralcould not be contained within the frame. The verticality of the space is emphasized throughout, but the piers in theforegroundespecially shoot up from the floor with such force that they become abstractions, thick lines brushed in rather than solid forms in a three-dimensional space. The soft tonality of theplatinum printthat Evans preferred shades the contours of the space, and the even illumination throughout flattens the plane of focus, diminishing the viewer's perception of depth so that the space appears compressed.
Frederick Evans's architectural study of the attic at Kelmscott Manor, a medieval house, part of which dates from 1280, is a visual geometry lesson. Thecompositionis all angles and intersections, formed not only by the actual structure but also by the graphic definition of light within the space. Soft illumination bathes the area near the stairs, while the photograph'sforegroundplunges into murky darkness. The sharp angles of intersecting planes are mediated by the rough-hewn craftsmanship of the beams and posts, almost sensuous in their sinewy imperfection and plainly wrought by hand. Theplatinum printmedium favored by Evans provides softened tonalities that further unify the triangles, squares, and diagonal lines of the dynamic composition.
Kneeling, a young woman turns away from the viewer to listen to an old woman whose open mouth and gesticulating hand indicate that she is in the midst of speech. The young woman wears a skirt and a sheer piece of cloth across her chest. With her face lost in profile, her naked neck, arms, and voluptuous breasts are displayed for the delectation of the male spectator. She holds a cluster of fruit in her right hand and a pruning knife in the other.The subject of this painting comes fromOvid'sMetamorphoses.The Roman GodVertumnus, disguised as the talkative old woman, attempts to seduce the reclusive woodlandnymphPomona. Netherlandish painters favored thisclassicalstory in the 1600s because of its moralizing lessons on the dangers of gullibility.
This carefully constructed, artful tableau is specificallyemblematicof the Eynards' lives. A portfolio of drawings on a footstool at the left of Madame Eynard denotes her talent as an amateur artist, a basket of flowers signifies her interest in gardening, and an upholstered chair symbolizes her skill in the decoration of the Eynards' houses. The painting to Jean-Gabriel Eynard's left represents his art collections, the top hat characterizes his dandyism, and the folding camp chair commemorates his travels as a financier and diplomat.
Perhaps reveling in the daguerreotype's capacity for recording minute detail, Jean-Gabriel Eynard combined sumptuous patterns to give thisdaguerreotypean extraordinary richness of texture. He wore a boldly graphic dressing gown and slippers, and his wife Anne sported an equally intricate jacket. Her striped skirt and lace cap, the giraffe skin-patterned tablecloth, and the diamond-patterned footrest add to the abundance of ornament.Madame Eynard's steady, worshipful gaze may reflect the devotion of wife to husband, or it may indicate her desire not to move her eyes during the exposure. She often assumed this pose--elbow propped on a table--when being photographed.
In this self-portrait, SwissdaguerreotypistJean-Gabriel Eynard imagined himself as a subject in anOld Masterpainting. Hunched over the large volume in seated profile, Eynard probably drew upon Dutch painting as a source to create this image. The image of a saint reading occurs frequently in Rembrandt van Rijn's paintings, etchings, and drawings, which Eynard had seen. The debt to thispainterlytradition is especially evident in the way the light appears to emanate from the open book.
The sweet intimacy of this family portrait--a friend's children and their nanny--is uncommon in Jean-Gabriel Eynard's work. He used careful planning to achieve the apparent informality suggested by the children's casual dress and slightly mischievous expressions. Judging from their leftward gaze, Eynard used something or someone out of camera range to attract their steady attention. With both children at the left, he artfully arranged the sober nanny's pose and skirt to fill the right side of the picture, balancing the three to form a sculptural group against the dark background.
Members of Jean-Gabriel Eynard's family and friends are gathered on the steps at Beaulieu, one of his country houses. Eynard's uncharacteristic absence from the scene indicates that he operated the camera himself, as well as posed the sitters. The patterns of the striped dresses and the delicately intertwined vines on the curtains add materially to the visual interest of the image.The three seated children, Eynard's great-nephews and great-niece, appear as young adults in a laterdaguerreotypeby Eynard. His wife Anna is the woman seated at left, and their adopted daughter is in the center.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard's lavish lifestyle required a large number of servants. Here, in front of a stable building at Fleur d'Eau, one of his country residences on the shore of Lake Geneva, Eynard arranged a groom, a coachman, and three gardeners holding the implements of their work: a broom, a rake, and a wheelbarrow. On the balcony above, laundresses pose among the drying linens.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard frequently photographed his closest friends and family. Here the deRegny family--parents holding their children, who wear matching plaid dresses--joined the Eynards at Eynard's house in Paris. The slight blur in the children's faces compared with those of the adults indicates some youthful impatience and movement during the daguerreotype's long exposure. Eynard himself appears seated in profile second from the right, with his wife at the far left.This quarter-platedaguerreotypeand others that Eynard made in the 1840s are smaller than the half-plate size he later favored.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard made two views of Geneva, which together form a panorama of a section of his adopted city. He stood in the old city on the left bank of the Rhone River, looking toward the quays along the right bank. A wide bridge crosses the river, connecting with a short footbridge to wooded Rousseau Island, named after the famous writer and philosopher of the 1700s, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a native of Geneva.
On the back of this carefully lit and posed daguerreotype, Jean-Gabriel Eynard identified the seated woman as a cook, Lisette Gilliard, whose profession one might guess from her sturdy forearms. Judging by her suntanned face, her standing companion Suzette was probably a poultry keeper. Both women wear plain work clothes: sprig-patterned dresses, long aprons, and lace kerchiefs and collars. Had the sitters commissioned this portrait for themselves, they would undoubtedly have donned more formal apparel.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard took care to pose these Eynard family members in such a way as to create a casual portrait. Sophie Eynard, seated in profile at the center, anchors the photograph, evenly balanced by two adults and one child on each side. The daguerreotypist himself, the third head from the left, peers out between the boy in a diagonally striped smock and trousers and Sophie Eynard, who holds her child's hand to keep him from squirming. Despite the careful arrangement of figures, Eynard achieved the overall effect of a spontaneous, almost playful grouping. The closeness between the families could be guessed from their tight proximity.
For this self-portrait, a somewhat wearied Jean-Gabriel Eynard propped his elbow on a table, perhaps to steady himself. Clearly proud of his abilities as adaguerreotypist, he leaned one half of one of his panoramas of Geneva against his top hat. The color applied to his face and hands and the flower in his buttonhole was meant to heighten the appearance of reality and is unusual in Eynard's daguerreotypes.
In Jean-Gabriel Eynard's numerous portraits with his wife, he seems to have directed her to assume a habitual pose. Here, as usual, she sits with her elbow propped on a table, her gaze directed at her husband. Closely framed and intimate, the portrait's formal elegance derives from its tight composition of interlocking triangles, varied patterns, and a severe background. Oddly, Eynard seems not to have made solo portraits of his wife as he did of himself and of Jean Rion. Most of his portraiture was devoted to groupings of sitters, which he took pains to arrange informally.
Amateur photographer Jean-Gabriel Eynard posed seven of his servants in a courtyard corner of his home, the Chteau Eynard in Geneva. One man and woman still wear their aprons as though they have been pulled outside to fulfill this duty, only to be soon returned to their real responsibilities in the kitchen. Out of deference to their employer or a keen awareness of the requirements of his hobby or both, the seven subjects successfully endured the lengthy exposure. Group portraits were a rare occurrence and a remarkable accomplishment for earlydaguerreotypists.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard frequently photographed his closest friends and family members, including the deRegny family and their children. Here they and the Eynards pose at Eynard's country house in Switzerland. Eynard himself appears in profile seated at the front, his rightward gaze accentuated by his restless-looking hair, brushed forward in an eccentric sweep of energy. Only the boy at the right looks boldly at the camera: everyone else in the photograph seems consciously preoccupied with someone or something out of camera range at the right.
Ready for the start of a summer family outing, two hatless young women perch in the rumble seat at the back of this carriage, a landau. More sedately, the older ladies inside the carriage wear bonnets since the top has been lowered. Because the horses fidgeted during the exposure, their heads are blurred, preventing the ensemble of figures, carriage, and horses from becoming a completely static silhouette against the facade of the house.The dramatic drop from the grassy foreground into blackness makes the entire scene appear as though it occurred on some kind of elaborate stage set. Eynard was well acquainted with stage design. Inside this house was a private theater, and on another occasion he brought the theater's painted sets outside to be photographed.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard carefully recorded the names and positions of his servants on the backs of thedaguerreotypeshe made of his large domestic staff. Thus it is known that he employed maids, valets, a butler, cooks, a milkman, coachmen, grooms, and gardeners for both flowers and vegetables. Eynard made this study and another group portrait of his servants outdoors at his country house near Rolle, on Lake Geneva, some distance from his principal residence in the city.
In this immaculately arranged grouping in front of Beaulieu, one of his beloved country houses on the shore of Lake Geneva, Jean-Gabriel Eynard stands in bright sunlight next to one of his carriages. The elegant awning over the door and windows gives an idea of the elaborate lifestyle enjoyed by the Eynard family.Although probably simply making herself visible for the camera, the woman who leans forward from inside the light carriage seems to wait for the photograph to be finished so that they can depart. The hands of the coachman, Jules Lachenal, remained steady on the reins during an exposure that probably lasted several seconds.
Unlike most of his contemporaries of 1850, Jean-Gabriel Eynard was accustomed to posing for the camera, always under his own direction. There are no known photographic portraits of Eynard by another photographer.In this self-portrait, he appears substantially at ease, sitting rather casually with his legs apart, his knees uneven, and his right arm draped over the chair. His sparkling eyes express his lively intelligence, and only the upright carriage of his head and the stiff gesture of his left hand, reminiscent of a pose often assumed byNapoleon, betray the stillness necessary for a crispdaguerreotype.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard made two views of Geneva, which together form a panorama of a section of his adopted city. He stood in the old city on the left bank of the Rhone River, looking toward the quays along the right bank. Here he focused on the wooded island named after the famous writer and philosopher of the 1700s, Jean Jacques Rousseau, a native of Geneva. To the far right, the lower end of Lake Geneva opens out from the Rhone River.
An unusual unanimity exists among the sitters in this scene, perhaps due to Jean-Gabriel Eynard's request for his friends and relations to direct their eyes to their right. The result is an appealing sort of expectancy, as though some person, carriage, or circus troupe is about to make an entrance from that direction. Eynard himself sits in the center with his top hat on his lap, a lively participant in the tableau.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard could only have made this still life outdoors, where there was sufficient light to capture his prized possessions. This study reveals his delight in the daguerreotype's uncanny ability to reveal intricate patterns while symbolizing his interest in the cause of Greek independence. He arranged twelve ancient Greek vases on fabric-covered tables beneath three paintings hanging on a rough plaster wall. The paintings depict the Madonna and Child and an unidentified baby, as well as a young woman who may be Eynard's wife at a younger age.
Adjoining the modest garden behind Jean-Gabriel Eynard's mansion in Geneva was a public botanical garden that included rose beds, a vineyard, and an elaborate greenhouse that housed tender plants like orange trees. In summer, the plants were lined up in precise rows in front of the greenhouse. Eynard himself sits on a bench at the left, barely visible as he reads a book. Also nearly hidden, a gardener in a smock stands at the right with his garden shears pointed down, ready for work.
Jean Rion, Jean-Gabriel Eynard's longtime valet, was the only one of his servants to become the sole subject of a formal portrait. Eynard probably singled him out in recognition of his work as Eynard's capable daguerreotypy assistant.Rion painstakingly prepared the plates and often performed the last-minute chemical procedures essential to the process, and removed and replaced the lens cap, which marked the beginning and end of the exposure. In this portrait, Eynard captured Rion's modest, serious, and thoughtful demeanor.
With the fortune Jean-Gabriel Eynard acquired as a financier during the Napoleonic wars in the early 1800s, he and his wife built a splendid house in Geneva. Several architects contributed to its design, but Madame Eynard, a talented amateur artist, played an important part in determining its layout and decor. Completed in 1820, the house was backed by a modest garden, from which Eynard made thisdaguerreotypeview of the garden front, its entrance shaded by a striped awning. The house now belongs to the city of Geneva, and its formal drawing rooms are now restored and used for receptions.
In conversation, the wily French statesman Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand dubbed this mansion a palace, and so it has since been called. The forecourt shown here was built on a substantial vault connected to the tops of the old ramparts of the city of Geneva, which now owns the house. Jean-Gabriel Eynard made this sharply angled study of the street front of his residence from the steps of a nearby building.
His top hat positioned on the table beside his elbow, Jean-Gabriel Eynard appears self-satisfied, and he might well have been. By his own efforts he had become rich; he had played a significant part in the history of Switzerland, his adopted country; and, by his generous funding, he had helped secure Greek independence from Turkey. As if to illuminate his success, glints of light reflect from his wedding ring and from the watch chain cutting across his elaborate waistcoat.
Although he was seventy-seven years old when this image was made,daguerreotypistJean-Gabriel Eynard appears alert, his expression dignified. His splendid fur-collared overcoat and his immaculately starched shirt with its stiff, high collar are representative of Eynard's extensive--and expensive--wardrobe. His hair, brushed forward at the temples in the style of his youth in 1800, is curiously static despite its windblown appearance.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard made this daguerreotype self-portrait with the assistance of his valet, Jean Rion. At nearly seventy years of age, Eynard presented himself as a distinguished, proud character, his attenuated, crossed leg kicking across the frame in perfect, almost dancer-like form. Believing that pose revealed a sitter's personality, Eynard chose the gesture deliberately.On the table Eynard displayed a daguerreotype of the temples of Saturn and Divine Vespasian in the Roman forum, possibly one that he made.  Although the complete title is illegible, the wordCAPODISTRIASis discernible on the large pamphlet placed on the chair beside him. Scholars have suggested that Eynard wrote the pamphlet in memory of his close friend Joannis Capodistrias, the martyred first President of Greece. Throughout his life, Eynard was devoted to the cause of Greek independence and perhaps included a reference here to indicate the cause's importance to him.
No other Jean-Gabriel Eynard image is quite so filled with activity and objects as this one. Oxen pull a cart, men gather for a conversation, and a carriage pulled by two handsome horses pauses on its journey. The cropped lawn and smoothly groomed road suggest that Eynard staged this scene on his own estate rather than on a public highway. The photographer himself peers out of the carriage next to Henri Dunant, the standing man in a dark topcoat, who later founded the Red Cross.
Jean-Gabriel Eynard's nephew and heir Charles Eynard married the daguerreotypist's adopted daughter, Sophie. They appear in this portrait with their children Gabriel, Hilda, and Fodor. Charles wrote biographies and, like other members of the family, was a talented amateur artist. Eynard's attempt to avoid the usual formality of group portraits of this period is reflected in his subjects' casual attitudes. Strangely enough, each figure is posed so that only a single hand is visible.
In keeping with the taste for naturalness and simplicity made fashionable by Marie-Antoinette, Laurent-Nicolas de Joubert is informally dressed in his waistcoat, his shirt open at the neck and adorned with a half-undone neckerchief. His crossed arms and open mouth suggest a transitory quality, as though he may speak or gesture at any moment.Early in his artistic career, Franois-Xavier Fabre was friendly with Joubert, a wealthy office-holder from Montpellier. The Joubert family were collectors andpatronsof the arts and supported the young Fabre's studies in Paris under Jacques-Louis David. Joubert himself was an amateur artist, and Fabre acknowledged this by portraying his friend resting his folded arms on what appears to be a closed sketchbook with paintbrushes nearby.Thependantto this portrait shows Madame Joubert in an outdoor garden setting. The Joubert family commissioned the pair of paintings to commemorate the marriage.
On August 24, 1785, Marie-Louise Poulletier de Perigny married the wealthy and cultured Laurent-Nicolas de Joubert. To commemorate the marriage, the Joubert family commissioned the young artist Franois-Xavier Fabre to make this portrait and itspendant.Seated on a garden chair, Madame Joubert slightly inclines her head and gazes at the viewer under half-lidded eyes. In her hair she wears a wreath made of myrtle, which is sacred toVenus, the goddess of love. A golden sash ties underneath the white bodice of her purple silk dress, and her loosely curling hair falls casually down alongside her shoulders and arms. Elegant hands are folded across her lap. The portrait achieves an uncomplicated effect, illustrating Fabre's use of theNeoclassicalstyle that he learned from his teacher Jacques-Louis David.
Richly ornamented with thickly gilded goats' heads, and painted butterflies, birds, and flowers, these vases were intended to be displayed before a mirror, so that both sides of their lavish decoration could be admired. In honor ofLouis XV'sofficial mistress,Madame du Barry, they were namedvases bouc du Barry(goat vases of Barry). The Svres porcelain manufactory sold these vases for the high sum of three hundred and sixtylivres--an amount equivalent to six months' salary for a porcelain painter.Svres artisans made the vases from  true,  hard-paste porcelain, instead of the traditional soft-paste. The hard-paste porcelain recipe was still new, and the craftsmen were still experimenting with different types of decoration when these pieces were produced in 1778. Instead of glazing the vases with ground color and then gilding them, porcelain gilders first applied the gold onto the white body of the vases. Porcelain painters then added enamel colors within the gold outlines. Decorators also experimented with the use of silver on thetrellisworkas seen on these vases, but they soon abandoned this practice since the silver tarnished over time.
This large and elaborately molded silver basin depicts episodes from the story ofCleopatra, the legendary queen of Egypt, and the Roman leader, MarcAntony. Perhaps drawing from Plutarch's history, the artist frames the climactic event of Cleopatra committing suicide in the center, within a circularfriezeof the Battle of Actium. The four oval cartouches on the rim represent important events related to Antony: at the top, Antony meetsOctavianand Lepidus on an island in the river Lavinus to form the Triumvirate; on the left, Antony first sees Cleopatra when she arrives on an impressive barge on the river Cydnus; on the bottom, a banquet; and on the right, Antony kills himself.Although the basin's design derives from a sketch by Genoese artist Bernardo Strozzi, the highreliefof the figures, some of whom are modeled almost in the round, theManneristturbulence of the battle scene, and the use of depth andperspectiveindicate the work of a northern European artist, perhaps one fromFlanders. The detail and delicacy of the silverwork of this basin suggest that it was ceremonial rather than functional; it was probably exhibited on a buffet on the most festive occasions.
Beside a blank canvas, a trio of fanciful female figures visits a dozing painter. One figure places a consoling arm around the artist and appears about to whisper words of inspiration in his ear. Another figure, upright at the right edge of the sheet, moves toward the artist with a palm frond in her left hand. An ethereal, winged figure floats through the background. In the lower right corner, Henri Fantin-Latour's signature suggests that the drawing was conceived as an independent work of art.Fantin-Latour was fascinated with the world of the artist and produced both lifelike portraits of hisImpressionistcontemporaries and imaginative works exploring themes of creativity, inspiration, and vision. The three female visitors in this drawing may represent the sleeping artist's inner life and symbolize his frustrated search for inspiration. Fantin-Latour used the lithographic crayon to enhance this dream-like quality, shrouding the scene in mystery. The artist also scraped away areas of crayon shading to heighten the otherworldly mood.
In the 1300s a woman suckling two children became the standard image of Charity, one of the three Virtues. Here the figure of Charity holds twoputtion her lap. One suckles her breast, while the other twists around to look down at her knee. Paolo Farinati used delicate lines, areas of wash, and touches of whitebodycolorto build each figure's form. Using brown ink, he outlined Charity and added dark, parallel lines of hatching to create shadows andhighlightson her robe. As an afterthought, he made changes to the suckling putto's leg and added his right arm. He may have used the column capitals along the bottom and thefriezeof putti on the verso as sources ofmotifsfor the many decorativefrescoesthat he painted in local villas.
Karla Grosch's performance ofMetalltanz,or  Dance in Metal,  exploited the reflective properties of polished metal. Theavant-gardeperformances produced by Oskar Schlemmer's Stage Workshop at theBauhausSchool are seen today as significant forerunners of modern performance art and multimedia theater.The photographer T. Lux Feininger studied at the Bauhaus with Schlemmer, under whose direction theater and dance became popular and important aspects of the German school's program.
The sheer prevalence in number, of clowning and grimacing pictures, is an indication of what I am speaking of...not only were my  models  everlastingly ready to  cut up,  but I, too, must have been very ready to photograph their antics. My self critique led me to conclude that I was protesting against something in these pictures...I had judged the  official Bauhaustone-setters...guilty of taking themselves too damned seriously, and that they needed  taking down. Thus T. Lux Feininger recalled the mood informing his picturemaking during his time as a student at the German crafts school, the Bauhaus. This playful photograph shows three unidentified members of the Bauhaus band with their instruments humorously juxtaposed and a ladder that neither leans on any wall nor leads anywhere. The smiling man at the center, wearing a bow tie and bellboy's cap, strums the banjo held by the grinning man at the right, who in turn appears to singlehandedly support the ladder upon which a third man plays the slide trombone in a dramatic, downward thrust parallel to the lines of the ladder. Influenced by the Jazz Age, both players and photographers evoke the lively spirit of that revolutionary movement in music.
In 1926 Feininger became the youngest student to enroll at the Bauhaus (the architecture and design school founded by Walter Gropius in 1919). His father, the Expressionist painter Lyonel Feininger, was a teacher there. The style promoted by the Bauhaus--spare, geometric, and functional design--was one of the most influential in the 1920s and 1930s. A self-taught photographer, Feininger carried his nine-by-twelve-inch box camera wherever he went and recorded everyday life at the school. The framing of his photographs reflects the influence of Modernism and vividly transmits the creativity, spontaneity, and enthusiasm of life at the Bauhaus.
These finelychasedwall lights represent the bounty of the harvest season. The central shaft symbolizes the thyrsus, or rod, ofBacchus, the Greek god of wine, a traditional symbol of abundance. The branches of the light formcornucopiasoverflowing with fruit, flowers, and leaves. Claude-Jean Pitoin made this set of four wall lights toilluminatethe small private room that Marie-Antoinette used as a retreat at the palace ofVersailles. As with all the objects made for the French queen, the set of small wall lights are of the highest quality. The chasing and thegildingof this light is jewel-like in its remarkable finish, proof of the care that went into its production.
Everything in this photograph is slightly at an angle, pulling away from the central axis of the image. The domes atop the buildings appear animated, and the delicate outlines of the crosses atop the domes seem to reverberate with energy like whirligigs. The domes in the foreground echo in close-up the details of the dense cluster of church rooftops at a distance. The arched windows at lower left are repeated throughout the cityscape visible in the distance at the image's center.In the fall of 1852, Roger Fenton, who had only taken up photography a few months before, traveled to Russia with an engineer friend who was constructing a bridge across the Dnieper River near Kiev. Fenton went along to photograph the bridge's construction, but he returned with an extensive series of what are now believed to be the first photographs of Moscow and the Kremlin.
Towers, walls, and turrets recede into the distance as far as the eye can see. The strong diagonalcompositionformed from Moscow's architecture is reinforced by the river bank and the sweep of barges in theforeground. To achieve this view, Roger Fenton set up his camera on a bridge across from the Moscow River. On the left, beyond the expanse of the river and a slender water tower, stands the recently completed Great Palace of the Kremlin. The octagonal bell tower of Ivan the Great rises just above and to the right. Another sixteenth-century building, the Cathedral of the Archangel, neighbors the bell tower.In September 1852, Fenton-who had only taken up photography a few months earlier-traveled to Russia with an acquaintance who was constructing a bridge for Czar Nicholas I. Perhaps recognizing that he was one of the first photographers to train his camera on Russia, Fenton made views of Moscow and St. Petersburg, capturing the distinct architectural character of each city. The cityscapes in this series are the earliest surviving photographs of Russia.
In 1854, the British Museum embarked on an experiment to test photography's potential for recording art and artifacts. At an earlier time, historical and scientific specimens were recorded in the form of drawings or engravings. But the new medium of photography offered greater accuracy and efficiency, and the museum hired Roger Fenton.During Fenton's seven-and-a-half years photographing for the museum, this extinct creature's skeleton was probably his most unusual subject. Photography reveals the skeleton's scaffold support of thin wires, its many vertebrae, and its strange proportions-from a tiny head and long neck, to wide hips and giant talons.Fenton set up a studio within the museum and became very innovative at arranging and lighting his subjects. He developed methods that are still used by commercial photographers today. Against an interior brick wall, he hung white sheets to form a backdrop so that he could more clearly emphasize the subject's physical structure. Skylight windows probably lit this particular specimen, but Fenton also relocated art objects onto the museum's rooftop to record them in direct sunlight for greater clarity.
In 1855 Roger Fenton left England to photograph in the Crimea, where the British, allied with theOttoman Empireand France, were engaged in war against the Russians. His was the first large-scale photographic documentation of a war. Field Marshall Lord Raglan was the commander of the British Forces in the field, whose distinguished military career included the Battle of Waterloo, where he lost an arm. In this photograph his sleeve is conspicuously pinned up in a kind of half-mast salute.Raglan sits in a doorway and looks away from the camera, his careworn body positioned at the boundary between light and shadow. Although the positioning is practical in terms of the light source, it is also metaphorical, placing Raglan on the cusp between a brilliant career and the twilight of life. The bright-white plumage of his hat lies across his lap like a dying bird. The bird is perhaps symbolic; Raglan was gravely ill with dysentery when the photograph was made and died within the month.
...in coming to a ravine called the valley of death, the sight passed all imagination: round shot and shell lay like a stream at the bottom of the hollow all the way down, you could not walk without treading upon them...--Roger FentonFenton's most famous photograph is also one of the most well-known images of war. Across a desolate and featureless landscape, not a single figure can be found. The landscape is inhabited only by cannonballs--so plentiful that they first appear to be rocks--that stand in for the human casualties on the battlefield. The sense of emptiness and unease is heightened by the visual uncertainty created by the changing scale of the road and the sloping sides of the ravine.Borrowing from the Twenty-thirdPsalmof theBible, the Valley of Death was named by British soldiers who came under constant shelling there. Fenton traveled to the dangerous ravine twice, and on his second visit he made two exposures. Fenton wrote that he had intended to move in closer at the site. But danger forced him to retreat back up the road, where he created this image.On a commissioned assignment, Fenton traveled in 1853 to the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, where England, France, and Turkey were fighting a war against Russia. To avoid offendingVictoriansensibilities, Fenton refrained from photographing the dead and wounded. His more than three hundred images of encampments, battle sites, and portraits of all miltary ranks, became the first extensive photo-documentation of any war. When exhibited in England, Fenton's photographs of the Crimean War established his reputation.
As part of his Crimean series, Roger Fenton photographed himself dressed in a Zouave uniform and holding a rifle. The Zouaves were French soldiers in a multinational allied army who fought in the Crimean War, where Fenton photographed them. The allied troops were made up of numerous ethnic groups. The Zouaves were exceptional not only for their colorfully exotic Algerian-derived uniforms, but also for their superior skill in battle. Fenton was given the uniform by a French general. Titling the image as though it were a photograph of an actual Zouave soldier but using himself as a model, Fenton forgoes accurate ethnic representation in favor of the romanticized play-acting in which he occasionally indulged.
Roger Fenton described the French architectural photographs he had seen in Paris as  subjectsequally interesting to the antiquarian and the lover of the picturesque.  He could easily have been writing about his own work.The French government's commissions to document and preserve their national historical monuments greatly impressed Fenton. A similar preservation movement, privately funded, was thriving in England when he undertook a series of photographs of Lindisfarne Priory in Northumbria. In this image, the soaring arch over the crossing of nave andtranseptstill stands triumphant amidst the rubble. The seated figure in the foreground lends dramatic evidence of the original structure's massive scale, still intact enough to reveal its vaulted splendor.
Wearing a cap from his days in the Crimea, Roger Fenton sits perched on a rock at one side of the Llugwy River. Fenton's presence implicitly invites the viewer to imagine themselves in his place, reading a guidebook and enjoying the surrounding scenery. The tiny figure, within the vast and dramatic expanse of nature, encourages the viewer to see the landscape as a place for reflection and reverie.Fenton's carefully composed view evokes theArcadianvisions of seventeenth-century landscape painters like Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The viewer journeys through distinct stages of the landscape-from the detailed rocks and figures in theforeground, to the softer trees and reflections of the middle distance, to the hazy silhouette of the far-off mountains.
Fenton positioned his camera at the precipice of a rugged mountain pass towering above farmland in the Nant Ffrancon Valley in northern Wales. He successfully conveyed the effect of great distance, leading from the falls and sharply defined rocks in the foreground to the serpentine walls of the valley and up the hazy incline beyond. Awe-inspiring topography like this appealed to Victorian viewers of Fenton's time, who would have considered the landscape sublime.
The French government's commissions to document and preserve their national historical monuments through photographs greatly impressed Roger Fenton. In the early 1850s he began to photograph England's  historical and architectural splendors.The BenedictineAbbeyof St. Mary at Glastonbury was one of the oldest abbeys in England. The graves of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, the legendary rulers of post-Roman Britain, were allegedly discovered in the cemetery at Glastonbury, and their bones were reburied in the abbey church. After a disastrous fire and centuries of strife within the church, themonasteriesat Glastonbury were dissolved and the abbey became a quarry, although some ruins, like the ones in this view, remained.The ravages of time and the force of nature are evident. Fenton's photograph evokes the passage of time: the lush cascade of ivy spills over the remainingtranseptarch, devouring the ruins and metaphorically reclaiming what is left of the abbey for the past.
The mountain peak of Moel Seabod rises up in the northwest corner of Wales, an area favored for its beautiful scenery by painters such as Joseph Mallord William Turner. A tourist guide of the early 1860s described this view looking up the valley as  one of the sweetest pictures on which the eye can rest.  At this  beauty spot,  as scenic views are called in Great Britain, the character of the valley changes from a lush, green pastoral landscape to rocky wilderness. Roger Fenton had this specific destination in mind when he set out to make the photograph. The railroad had recently begun to run only a few miles from the site, so Fenton conceivably could have used it to transport himself and his traveling darkroom, which was essential for the photographic processes used in the mid-1800s.Landscape photographs such as this one established Fenton's reputation as a photographer and were consistently successfully exhibited by him. One reviewer exulted that Fenton  seems to be to photography what Turner was to painting--our greatest landscape photographer.  Fenton was especially praised for his command of aerialperspective, the ability to convey the effect of distance on the flat plane of the photograph.
TheBayadre(dancing girl) undulates sensually for her audience of one. ThePasha(Turkish military or civil official) watches her, entranced by her suggestive dance. The musician plays intently, accompanying the performer but dutifully casting his eyes away. Is this a glimpse into a forbidden world of Near Eastern carnal delights  Did Roger Fenton luck upon this private scene during his travels in the Crimea  No, in actuality, this photograph was staged in Fenton's studio in London with hired models, and the woman's arms are held aloft by strings to keep them perfectly still. The subject is Orientalist, a term that refers to romanticized depictions by European artists of scenes of Muslim culture in the Ottoman Empire and its territories in the Near East and North Africa.As in this instance, Orientalist scenes were more often fiction than fact. Western cultural biases and misunderstandings were laid down on paper or canvas and frequently became the only source of information in the Western world on the subjects depicted. Few nineteenth-century non-Eastern viewers could dispute their authenticity, since only a small number of them had actually visited such places. Reviews from 1858 confirm that viewers believed in the veracity of the images; when photographs from the Orientalist suite, including this one, were first exhibited, one reviewer enthused:  [These] are favourable examples, being admirable illustrations of Eastern scenes of actual life. 
In the 1800s, a growing interest in what were considered exotic lands spawned a proliferation of images and texts that dealt with the foreign individual as the mysterious  other.  Although costumed as an Egyptian dancer, this woman is actually an English model posing in Roger Fenton's London studio. Unable to capture the woman dancing since movement would render the image a blur, the photographer instead showed various musical instruments associated with dance.
Three years after traveling in the Crimea, Roger Fenton made a series of Orientalist photographs in his London studio using props gathered during his travels and non-Eastern models.Orientalismrefers to just such romanticized depictions of imagined scenes of Muslim culture in theOttoman Empireand its territories in theNear Eastand North Africa.Orientalist scenes were more often fiction than fact. Cultural biases and misunderstandings were laid down on paper or canvas and frequently became the only source of information on the subjects depicted. When a group of these Orientalist photographs was exhibited in 1858, one reviewer described them as  truly representing some phases in the life of this interesting people. But not everyone so easily accepted Fenton's images at face value; a more astute critic called for  the necessity of having real national types as models.  The same model shown here also appears as  Nubian  and  Egyptian  in other photographs by Fenton. This photograph may have originally been exhibited with the titleThe Reverie. The odalisque, meaning a slave or concubine in a harem, poses upon her sofa. Barefoot, blouse open, her surroundings convey a sensual disarray that conforms to an Orientalizing fantasy of the available woman.Gift of Professors Joseph and Elaine Monsen
A group of fashionable men and women enjoy a game of billiards in a richly furnished salon. The recently completed billiards room, which was designed as a conservatory, is flooded with sunlight, illuminating the lavish interior and creating a dramatic pattern of light and shadows. Indoor photography was rare in the mid-1800s, but the abundance of light and Fenton's skill with the wet-collodion process created a remarkably detailed portrait of the space and its inhabitants. Behind the woman standing in the doorway at the very far end of the salon, a marble bust, mantelpiece, and mirror can be seen in an adjacent room.Mentmore House was a country residence of the wealthy Rothschild family, but little is known as to how Fenton came to photograph its interior or who the depicted individuals might be. Fenton accepted commissions to document several other country homes, and his surviving photographs of Mentmore House-both interior and exterior views-may have formed part of a commissioned album. Like Fenton's Orientalist scenes, this image reveals a high degree of staging. Only one figure actually holds a cue stick, and several of the women wear hats that seem unusual for the indoor setting.
Roger Fenton began to make still lifes of fruits and flowers toward the end of his brief photographic career. Unlike his earlier, more documentary work, the still lifes were Fenton's conscious effort to align the medium of photography with the more traditional art form of painting.This composition shows a bounty of edibles displayed against the rich textures of fringed lace and plaid shawls. The spiky stems of the pineapple push forward in the frame, begging to be plucked to expose the sweet ripeness inside. A glass decanter, its mouth and stopper subtly echoing the plump curves of the velvety peaches, glistening grapes, and succulent squash, refers slyly to wine, that most intoxicating fruit of fruits.
In thisaltarpiece, whose top was originally curved, the kings kneel at Christ's feet and their entourage gathers around, symbolizing the three continents--Asia, Europe, and Africa--to whichChristianitywould soon spread. The Adoration of theMagistory allowed artists to depict the kings' wondrous gifts and exotic splendor, making it a favorite subject for altarpieces in the 1400s and 1500s.Following the Netherlandish tradition, Defendente Ferrari painted minute details, jewel-like color, and distinct physical types. The angular style, richly embroidered draperies, and specific faces show his familiarity with the practices of Rogier van der Weyden and southern France.
The Latin inscription on the stone tablet attached to the front of the ledge sums up this portrait:  Francesco Maria Niccol Gabburri, citizen of Florence, aged sixty-five years, prefect of the Noble Academy of the Art of Painting of the city of Florence, among the bestpatronsof the Fine Arts, drawn for him as a monument to his noble sprit and given to him by Giovanni Domenco Ferretti, painter from Florence, who did it from the man himself. A Florentine nobleman, diplomat, painter, and collector, Gabburri appears surrounded by several volumes entitledLives of Painters,from the series that he wrote but never published. With one hand he points to a round, sculpturalreliefofApollo, the god of the arts. Made two years before his death, the drawing glorifies him as a great collector and man of letters.The formality of this carefully finished portrait suggests that it was meant to be engraved, though scholars know of no existing print. The painstaking physical detail, from the rich draperies to the detailing of the books, together with the subtle modulation of his rich garments all suggest translation into the printed medium.
One train halts on a track, while another train with a much larger steam engine waits behind it. A number of individuals on the train pose for the photographer, a customary practice in railroad photographs. Marc Ferrez made this image to document one of the new railroads expanding throughout Brazil in the 1880s for state-sponsored geological commission, but it also demonstrates a clear disparity between two socio-economic classes. A group of laborers stands out in the sun on the left, while the well-dressed men on the right remain under the shade of a canopy.
Brazil's emperor, Dom Pedro II, commissioned Marc Ferrez to document the construction of an aqueduct being built to supply water to the capital city of Rio de Janeiro. The aqueduct bridge over the St. Anthony River snakes through the photograph like a scaly serpent, bisecting the dark, lush foliage andfixingthe imprint of humans and growing urbanization upon the landscape. Without a glimpse of sky above or ground below, the bridge seems to hover suspended in the verdant landscape. The small figure of a man standing on the bridge footpath at the left provides a sense of scale with which to compare the aqueduct's size with its human creators.
Commessocan best preserveantiquityand memory...and can resist all the battles of water and wind and other mishaps of fortune and of time.Thus Giorgio Vasari wrote ofcommesso,a newly revived antique technique for making pictures with cut stone.His comments suggest thatFerdinando I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, commissioned this portrait ofPope Clement VIIIin 1601 to preserve the pope's memory, since he honored antique culture and learning. The rigidity of themosaicmedium and the luminescence of the stones, which were thought to carry intrinsic symbolic values, give the image an austere power.Pictorial representations in stone mosaic had been popular in ancient Greece and Rome and recently revived inRenaissanceItaly. Images made of hard- and softstonecommessiwere much admired in theMedici court, particularly by Ferdinando, who founded a court workshop in which local craftsmen could be trained in the technique. Portraits in this medium, however, are exceedingly rare; this is one of only two surviving works from a group of four.
Domenico Fetti shows theOld TestamentheroDavid, not as an innocent young boy with a slingshot, but as a muscular young shepherd who will soon be king of Israel. With his bulging arm and self-confident gaze, David looks fully aware of the significance of his recent killing. Holding the massive, severed head of Goliath in one hand and an oversized sword in the other, he gazes down at the viewer with a direct and shrewd expression. Fetti used rapid strokes of red chalk with soft parallel lines of hatching to give texture to the soft folds of his shirt and cap and its feathered plumes. Touches of black and white chalk create deeper shadows and richhighlightswhile animating the image.Scholars believe Fetti created this drawing as apreparatory studyfor his painting of David with Goliath's head.
Facing the viewer, a bearded man in theatrical clothing poses in front of a loosely painted, classicizing backdrop. He holds a sheet of music in his left hand and with his right hand points at an overturned bowl in the foreground, avanitassymbol that refers to the emptiness of material possessions. Intense eyes set in an expressive face watch the viewer while he gestures. In the lower right-hand corner, two young men, perhaps admirers, watch with interest.The bearded man may have been a singer or actor shown in a role from a play; his informality also suggests that he may have been a friend of the artist, Domenico Fetti.
Candelabra such as this pair would have been placed on a mantelpiece, a commode, or asecrtairein a salon of a stylish Parisian townhouse.Scholars use various decorative details to identify and precisely date an object like this. Thegiltbronze figures of women with Egyptian headdresses and acanthus leaves clustered with fruit and flowers are of the same form as themountson three Chineseporcelainvases now in theMuse du Louvre. The aunts ofLouis XVI, princesses Adlade and Victoire, ordered these vases from themarchand-mercierFranois-Charles Darnault in 1786 for their chteau of Bellevue. The candelabra may have been produced at the same time.
Clusters of grapes hang from the scrolling arms and drip pans of this pair of delicately modeled wall lights, while each is topped by a trophy of birds and leafy branches. In 1787 wall lights of this model were delivered by the bronzegilderPierre-Franois Feuchre to thecommissaire gnralThierry de Ville d'Avray for his bedroom at the Garde-Meuble, the royal furniture warehouse in Paris. In the following year Feuchre delivered four wall lights of the same form but with an added third branch carrying a winged child holding a heart for Marie-Antoinette's use in the chteau of Saint-Cloud.
The clock's swirling leaves and asymmetrical overall design are typical of the work of Juste-Aurle Meissonnier, a designer and goldsmith and one of the leading exponents of the Rococo style. In an engraved book of Meissonnier's works, published about 1750, the antechamber wall in a cross-section of a house features a large clock with a reclining figure below the dial positioned like that on the Getty Museum's clock.Such clocks, also known aspendules d'alcove(alcove clocks), were usually small, suitable for hanging in an alcove above a bed. The repeating mechanisms that chimed the nearest hour and quarter hour when a string was pulled eliminated the need to light a candle to see the dial. They also prevented the constant chiming that would awaken a sleeper. This is the largest known example of thependule d'alcove,indicating that it was made for an extremely imposing interior.The figures on this clock represent Love conquering Time, a theme often repeated on mid-eighteenth century French clocks. The two cherubs above carry away the scythe and hourglass, the symbols of Time, while Time himself lies vanquished below with his globe, protractor, and pair of compasses.
The tiny size of this vessel did not hinder its painter from creating intricate, miniature decoration over the entire surface of the vase. Twosphinxesface each other on the front of the main band of decoration on thisCorinthianblack-figurearyballos. The sphinxes are not part of a story but rather serve as decorative elements. On the back, a goat grazes under the handle. Filling ornament such as pinwheel rosettes and spirals surrounds the animals. Apalmetteandlotusdesign decorate the vase's shoulder, and the lower band on the body shows two dogschasinga hare, a common theme.Aryballoi were used to hold perfumed oil. The vessel's narrow opening and the wide plate around the mouth were intended to prevent spills of this precious commodity. The shape of aryballoi developed over time from an early pointed form to later rounded forms. The long, pointed shape of this example is distinctively early, or Proto-Corinthian.
A medieval historical compilation drawing on theBibleand the works ofclassicalauthors, the French text of theAncient History until the Reign of Caesar (Histoire ancienne jusqu' Csar)was intended to explain the moral meaning of historical events to lay readers. Originally conceived as a universal history stretching from thecreationof the world through the first years of the 1200s, the never-completed work ends during the reign of Caesar.The Getty Museum owns six leaves from a luxurious copy of theAncient Historyilluminatedin Paris around 1390 by an anonymous artist known as the First Master of the Bible Historiale of Jean de Berry. Related to thegrisailletechnique often found inInternational stylemanuscripts, this artist's vigorous pen drawings give the scenes an immediate and improvisational character. They do not present a historically accurate picture of life before the time of Caesar but place the events in medieval settings. The familiar surroundings would help readers to make a connection between their own experience and the moral and practical examples in the stories.
TheAncient History up to the Reign of Caesarbegins with thecreationof the world as described in the biblical book ofGenesis. These fourminiatures, which compress the seven days of creation into four scenes, would originally have opened themanuscriptfrom which this leaf was cut. At the upper left, God, who is repeated in each of the fourmedallions, appears with his compass as the divine architect of the universe. On the upper right, he creates the moon and stars. The image at the lower left shows God creating the fish and animals. Finally, God creates Eve at the lower right, representing the beginning of humankind.
Thisminiatureshows how those living around 1400 might have constructed the Tower of Babel using pulleys, winches, and manual labor. As recounted inGenesis, the first book of theBible, the Babylonians wished to build a tower  with its top in the heavens.  Displeased with the arrogant project, God prevented its completion by giving the builders a multitude of languages so that they could not communicate with each other. Aprophetwrapped in billowing drapery at the left directs the viewer's gaze and mind to the moral of the story. The two figures operating the pulley on top of the tower look fearfully to the left where the judgment of God descends in punishment in the form of a sword.
Although the battle ofTroyas a historical event took place in ancient Greek times, this artist depicted it in the guise of a medieval tournament. The raging battle takes place before the fortified walls of a medieval town, whose central tower thrusts beyond the confines of the miniature's golden frame. The artist portrayed the Trojans and Greeks as medieval knights on horseback equipped with armor of the 1300s, and thecompositionrecalls contemporary illustrations in chivalricmanuscripts. The rhythm of the water, the posture of the central knight, and the opposition of the lances give this earlyInternational stylecomposition a dynamic quality.
According to Roman legend, Rhea, daughter of the king of Alba Longa, bore the war godMarstwin sons named Romulus and Remus. To prevent the infant twins from claiming the throne, a man who had deposed her father as king ordered the infants drowned in the river Tiber. The basket in which they were placed, however, safely floated down the river and landed at the future site of Rome. There a she-wolf, an animal sacred to Mars, took care of them until a herdsman named Faustulus discovered them. In theminiature, the tightly swaddled twins lie by the side of the Tiber. The she-wolf hovers protectively over them at the left, while Faustulus approaches from the right. The great city of Rome, which the twins will eventually found, stands in splendor in the middle of the miniature, while two men, perhaps Romulus and Remus as adults, hunt with their hawks to the far right.
At the age of fourteen,Alexander the Greatsuccessfully tamed a horse called Bucephalus, which no man had been able to approach,mount, or bridle. Because of a prophecy that whoever tamed this wild stallion would conquer the world, this event is key to the Alexander legend, foreshadowing his eventual conquest of much of the known world.Theilluminatordepicted Alexander in fancy court dress, with his pointy shoes revealing his royal status. The text describes Bucephalus as having the mane and tail of a lion, but the artist chose to show the beast as a sturdy war-horse. The young Alexander calmly strokes the beast's nose while his father King Philip watches from the far right.
This portion of theAncient History to the Reign of Caesardiscusses the history of Rome, the long-time adversary of the state of Carthage and the sworn enemy of Hannibal's family. At the tender age of twenty-six, Hannibal was elected commander-in-chief of the Carthaginian army and went on to become one of the greatest military leaders of antiquity. Much of Hannibal's subsequent career was devoted to consolidating Carthage's possessions in Spain, an effort that eventually led to a bitter war with Rome.In this image, Hannibal and his army set sail for Spain against the imposing backdrop of Carthage's fortified walls. The crowned Hannibal sits high up in the ship to the right, elevated above his troops and the only figure whose head rises up above the water. In another ship, elephants stand equipped for battle, evidence of the army's origin on the northern coast of Africa.
Around 1913 Princess Obolenskaya participated in a ballet featuring members of the Saint Petersburg aristocracy. Historians are uncertain whether the princess was a trained dancer, but the faint silhouette of a supporting stand painted out in the negative suggests otherwise.
This vibrant architectural scene is atour de forceof illusionism and perspective. It is made ofscagliola,a mixture of stucco, glue, and colorants put on a stucco surface and intended to imitate the more expensive and technically demanding medium ofcommessoor stone mosaic. Scagliola was also preferred because it allowed for a more painterly rendering. The plaque depicts a classic Renaissance coffered arcade that recedes to a landscape of other Italianate buildings and a park. Imitation marble is used here to depict real marble buildings, and linear perspective creates the illusion of a three-dimensional scene. Perspective prints and stage-set designs published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries inspired this picturesque scene. The tricks of perspective exemplify the Baroque interest in illusion and theatricality. The plaque may have been originally planned for insertion in a piece of furniture or to be framed and hung on the wall.
Using the newly invented automatic shutter camera and roll film that was more light-sensitive than earlier negative material, Louis Fleckenstein captured the fleeting joy being experienced by his children, who are observed here with charming spontaneity. The foreground shadows, the gentle arc of the tree at the upper right, and the darkened foliage of the trees at the upper left create a circular focus, highlighting the two smiling, jumping girls in their dynamic, airborne garments.
Trude Fleischmann photographed the Cornides family, whom she knew on both a professional and personal level, over many years. Hermine Cornides was a physician with two young sons when this portrait was made. As the daughter of middle-class parents, she was schooled at home in only languages and the arts. Cornides managed to obtain a high school degree on her own, however, and subsequently, permission to study medicine in Prague and Paris. She finished her degree in 1913. Here she presents herself in a current fashion of severely tailored clothing, with mannish tie and hair.
Trude Fleischmann hosted actors, musicians, and artists in her Viennaatelier. She photographed the Thimigs, a family of actors, many times, often showing them in costume. Here father Hugo and brothers Hermann and Hans appear in a less-than-conventional  family  portrait with their sister, Helene, huddled together in an overlapping conversation of heads.
The melancholy mood of this character portrait is especially appropriate for its subject, the actress Margarethe Koeppke. In the year of her premature death, Koeppke played the tragic figure of the nearly blind, fourteen-year-old Hedwig, daughter of Ibsen's protagonist Hjalmar Ekdal in the playThe Wild Duck.Ekdal is a photographer, and much of the play takes place in his studio. This play ends with Hedwig's suicide. The photograph was likely made as a publicity image.
From a large family, Joseph was his father Jacob's favorite son. Joseph had the gift of prophecy and the skill to interpret dreams, and was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers. He became a servant in the house of an Egyptian official and prospered for a time, until he was falsely accused of a crime and imprisoned.In this pen and ink drawing, Joseph is depicted in prison with his fellow inmates, the Pharaoh's baker and butler, both of whom had offended their royal master. While in custody, each had an unsettling dream and turned to Joseph for interpretation.Joseph sits on the far right addressing the butler and baker emphatically with one arm outstretched toward the viewer as he explains the dreams. The figure on the left is likely the baker and sits and listens impassively, while the figure on the right is probably the baker who listens attentively with his head resting in his hand. The butler will hear from Joseph that his dream portends his release. The baker, on the other hand, will learn of his execution by hanging in three days time.Joseph himself will languish in prison for another two years, until Pharaoh experiences a disturbing dream and his butler remembers Joseph's prophetic gifts.
This fashionably dressed young man stands in aclassicalcontrappostopose and looks over his right shoulder into the distance. He wears a long coat over his vest and breeches, a cravat tied loosely around his neck, and narrow leather boots. He wears his hair long underneath his three-cornered hat or bonnet. In the 1600s, men and women wore their hats indoors and even at dinner; only in the presence of royalty was headgear removed.Working with great sureness, Govaert Flinck nearly completed a finished drawing except for the positioning of the cane, which he left uncertain. Using only black and white chalk against colored paper, he created a dynamic composition out of a single figure. The black chalk strokes outline the body and clothing, while the light chalk lines highlight the shimmering movement of the silk overcoat. These white tones appear to advance to the front, while the blue of the paper recedes into space. Although Flinck sometimes used his figure studies for paintings, he does not seem to have done so with this drawing.
Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, sits in a rocky landscape with his wife, Ariadne. He holds grapes and a wine cup, while she squeezes grapes into a ewer of wine at her side. She wears the golden crown--set with red gems to look like roses--that Bacchus gave her upon their marriage.Subjects drawn from classical antiquity--and this sculpture's frontal composition--were typical of Florentine bronzes from the early 1700s. Giovanni Battista Foggini arranged the two figures not to be seen from all sides but primarily from a single viewpoint in front. Despite the shallowness of the composition, the figures gracefully twist on their axes. Ariadne in particular assumes the form of a corkscrew, with her knees bending to her right and her shoulders swinging to the left. As was characteristic of sculpture at this time, the figures' bodies are much more expressive than their faces, which are emotionally blank.Foggini was working for the Medici when he made this bronze sculpture; after his death, his son sold a plaster model of the group to the Ginori Porcelain Manufactory at Doccia. Porcelain copies made from that model still exist.
Because of his association withBacchus, the Greek god of wine, thefaunusually appears in art with a goatlike face, pointed ears, a tail, and horns. Identified by the Romans asPan, the god of woods and field, flocks and herds, he was able to charmnymphswith his music. This subject, common in antiquity, regained popularity in theRenaissanceandBaroqueperiods.Giovanni Battista Foggini, who worked at a time when Florence witnessed an intense interest in the production of bronzereductionsof ancient works, based this sculpture on aHellenisticmarble statue in the collection of the Galleria degli Uffizi. Along with only two others of the many known copies of the ancient work, this one includes the tree trunk from the ancient marble, which draws a parallel to the antique but is not needed for support. He may have created the sculpture as a diplomatic gift from theMedicicourt.
Night clocks were designed to indicate the hours with a dialilluminatedfrom behind with an oil lamp. In this way, the numbers would have been visible in a dark or dimly lighted room. They never became very popular, however, as keeping the lamp alight through the night required constant care, either by refueling or trimming the wick.This timepiece was a collaborative effort of several of the most skilled artists who worked for theMedicifamily in Florence, including Leonard van der Vinne and Giovanni Battista Foggini. In addition, the statue of the boar mounted on the top may have been modeled by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, based on aclassicalmarble statue in the Uffizi. The clock's architectural shape copies the form of churchaltarpieces, while its elaborate stone decoration includes both flat scrolls inmosaicsand innovative three-dimensional fruit garlands at the sides. The mechanism was created by Francesco Papillion.
Laocon and his two sons writhe and struggle, caught in the grip of the serpents that wind among their limbs. The father's large size, powerful musculature, and wild hair and beard contrast with his smaller, smoother-limbed sons. As retold in Greek mythology, the Trojan prince Laocon angered Apollo by breaking a vow of celibacy he swore to the god and then warning the Trojans not to bring the wooden horse left by the Greeks into the city. To silence him, Apollo sent serpents from the sea to kill him and his sons.Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze of this story is based on a famous marble sculpture of the Laocon unearthed in Rome in 1506. The Roman historian Pliny had described this renowned sculpture in awed language, as  a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced.  Its celebrity prompted many bronze reductions, or smaller-scale copies including this one, made in Florence. Although it imitates an antique work, the emotionalism and frontality of this bronze are characteristics of the late Baroque Florentine style.This type of tabletop bronze was often displayed on a cabinet where it served as a souvenir of the  Grand Tour,  evidence of its owner's classical education.
Two brightly colored figural groups from the GinoriPorcelainfactory depict violent episodes from the Roman poetOvid'sMetamorphoses.Modeled in porcelain,Jupiter'smessengerMercuryattacks Argus on one pedestal, whilePerseuskillsMedusaon another. The factory reused Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze casting molds, replicating theBaroquesculptor's muscular figures, wind-blown dramatic draperies, and dynamiccompositions. Yet the painting, using jewel-like yellow, purple, blue, and pinkpigmentsandgilding, brings out a spirited delicacy more typical of theRococostyle of the mid-1700s. As a result, Medusa, whose horrifying look was reputed to turn men to stone, is merely a rather startlingly rosy-cheeked woman with snakes for hair, while Argus, the hundred-eyed giant who tormented Jupiter's lover Io, is a handsome, muscled warrior.Each figural group is made from ten separate sections, each of which was press-molded and fired before being joined together. The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum. The two lively groups would have been a dramatic centerpiece for a dinner-table setting.The group was painted in the shop of Johann Karl Wendelin Anreiter von Zirnfeld.
Known as a  skeleton clock  because of its exposed movement, this type of timepiece became popular at the end of the 1700s. Collectors appreciated the movement as an object of beauty, to be enjoyed as much as the case, which would formerly have hidden the elegant enameled dials.Besides telling the time with the large dial, the lower dials indicate the days of the week and the days of the month. Above, a fourth dial records the phases of the moon.
Three times during his reign,Louis XVcommissioned large suites of carved furniture for general use in the royal palaces. This pair of armchairs belonged to his final order. They were described in a royal inventory, which noted that the carver Foliot delivered fourteen armchairs, twenty-eight side chairs, nine beds, and seven firescreens to the palace ofVersaillesbetween May and September of 1762. When delivered, the chair frames were of polished wood, andgildednails held the crimson damask upholstery in place.By 1790 the chairs had been transferred to the palace ofFontainebleau, where they were stenciled underneath with a mark for this royal residence. Inventories show that the chairs had been painted white and reupholstered with crimson velvet by the end of the 1700s. When J. Paul Getty purchased the pair in the 1930s, they had been covered in tapestry and gilded. Using the 1762 inventory as a guideline, Getty Museum conservators returned the chairs to their original appearance.
These chairs were part of a suite of eight side chairs and eight armchairs made for the French queen Marie-Antoinette (reigned 1774-1792). Designed in theNeoclassicalstyle with carved bands of ivy, laurel wreaths, and fluting, they stood in thesalon du rocherof the Belvedere Pavilion located in the gardens of the palace ofVersailles.

The design of this ceramic pilgrim flask, with its tall tapering neck, screw cover, and flat oval body, reflects the influence of metal pilgrim flasks, which in turn were patterned after the dried gourds travelers used to carry drinking water. The side loops above the horned masks on the sides and the holes cut from either side of the base would never have been used to suspend the Museum's flask; they were retained as decoration and a reminder of the vessel's earlier function.Marine scenes decorate both sides of the flask: one of a triton abducting a nereid and one of two fighting tritons. This exceptionally rich and varied palette is typical of ceramics from the Fontana workshop. The son of a famous potter from Castel Durante, Orazio Fontana started his own workshop in 1565 in Urbino, helping to establish that area as the most important place for maiolica production in the late 1500s.
Filled with scented water, basins of this type were offered to dining guests for washing their hands between the courses of a meal. This shallow and splendidly painted example, however, was probably used for display.The central scene tells the story ofDeucalionand Pyrrha fromOvid'sMetamorphoses. According to the legend, this husband and wife renewed the human race after a devastating flood by casting stones behind them. The stones assumed human form when they struck the earth.Orazio Fontana developed a new type ofmaiolicadecoration inspired by Raphael's frescoed rooms in theVatican, which in turn were inspired by ancient Roman wall paintings. Known asgrotesquemotifs, these elegant and fantastic embellishments began to cover increasingly large areas of his work until they dominated the decoration, as on this basin.
Designed as a pair, these elaborately modeled drug jars were made to contain mithridatum and theriac, used as antidotes to poisons, to ward off the plague, and as general cure-alls. They were among the most highly prized and complex drugs in theRenaissancepharmacy, especially in Italy and France, where they continued to be made for centuries. The highly decorative combination ofgildingand lead-white paint on the outside of the vessels disguises their basic function as drug jars, a purpose supported by the fact that their interiors are glazed to make them watertight. These jars, elaborately decorated with a rich sampling of sixteenth-century ornament, would have been prominently displayed by the owner or pharmacy to which they belonged. The vigorous strapwork, masks, andreliefand figural decoration are typical of ItalianManneristdecorative arts and are closely related to the work of the most important Milanese sculptor of the period, Annibale Fontana.
Thisterracottadrug jar, one of a pair, was made to contain a specific preparation:antidotum methridaticum,named for King Mithridates VI, who invented the medicine and whose life is shown in scenes that decorate the jar. Mithridates ascended to the throne of Pontos in 111 B.C. An amateur pharmacist fearful of being poisoned by his enemies, Mithridates developed his own antidote, which he ingested regularly  just in case.  After his defeat in a battle against the Romans, he attempted to commit suicide by taking poison, but because of his daily dose of the prophylactic preparation, he was unsuccessful. In desperation, Mithridates forced one of his own guards to slay him. Areliefon one side of the jar shows Mithridates being given either his daily antidote or the ineffectual-suicide poison. On the front of the vessel, a relief illustrates the death of Mithridates at the hand of his guard.
Thisterracottadrug jar, one of a pair, was made to contain a specific preparation:theriaca Andromachi.The preparation was named for Andromachus, shown seated on the lid clasping a drug jar against his thigh, who was the court physician for the Roman EmperorNero. Commanded by Nero to improve on an existing antidote for poison, Andromachus removed some ingredients and added others, the most important of which was vipers' flesh. Thereliefon the back of the jar shows Andromachus in the act of cutting up some vipers, while being observed by a group of doctors, all wearing tall hats. The relief on the front shows the doctor presenting his new drug to the Emperor.
Three studies of the head of a youth wearing a cap are placed harmoniously on a single sheet of paper. The top two studies show the young figure in profile. In the lower half of the page, the subject holds a more frontal pose looking downward and to his right with a fixed gaze. Composed of a series of confidently applied, curving strokes, the boy's black curls wrap around his ears in two of the studies and serve as a strong contrast to his light-colored cap. In the lower head, the boy's dark curls are also contrasted with short, light lines that delineate the nose and mouth.Although the three studies have not been connected to any known painting by Francesco Fontebasso, very similar heads of youths do appear in a number of his works. Scholars believe studies were a studio exercise used later as a reference for painted works. The top two heads show Fontebasso masteringprofile perdu(lost profile), where a figure is drawn turned away from the artist, thus presenting a difficult and dramaticallyforeshortenedpose.
A standing Joseph gestures dramatically with his right hand as he interprets the dreams and foretells the futures of two fellow captives. Learning that he is to be released, the younger prisoner, his body uncoiling, reacts with relief. In sharp contrast, the older prisoner collapses in grief--Joseph has told him that he will be executed. The architectural backdrop reinforces these differing fates. The left side of the drawing is spacious and open, leading to freedom. The closed-off right side offers no such reprise; the older prisoner will never again experience the world beyond the barred window.The high degree of finish indicates that Francesco Fontebasso probably created the drawing for the album of a collector. The artist produced a series of biblical subjects in pen and wash, and this scene fromGenesiswas almost certainly included. The complex spatial setting, with its elaborately interlocking architectural elements, may have been inspired by Giovanni Battista Piranesi's series of engravings of prisons.
This sweet-faced little boy, barely higher than the table he rests on, gazes at the camera. Families who had relocated to California during the Gold Rush often commissioned photographic portraits like this one to send to relatives back home. The photographer and the boy's family sought to capture the flavor of life in the West by showing the diminutive boy dressed in a Western outfit of loose, open blouse and boots. In front of him on the hexagon-patterned carpet, a pile of wooden toys represents tools of the '49ers: pick, shovel, wheelbarrow, and rifle.
Luca Forte's original meaning for this bountiful still life has been lost, but it may be an evocation of the bounty of autumn. The grapes, apples, and pears represent harvest fruits, and a seed-filled open pomegranate itself symbolizes abundance. As here, Forte typically added tiny insects, snails, and drops of moisture to the fruit. By painting on a copper panel with painstaking brushwork, he gave his surfaces a polished smoothness similar to fine enamel.Forte was known for his sensitivity to the material nature of the objects he represented, capturing their solidity and roundness through light, shade, and color. Best known in his own day as a specialist in these fruit still lifes, Forte transformed the development of still life in Naples. He introduced landscapes as backdrops, instead of the plain, dark backgrounds of the earlier Neapolitan style, which followed Caravaggio's lead.
Ettore Forti meticulously researched theclassicalobjects and decorations in this historical genre painting, but he improbably combined a grand, luxurious setting with an intimate, domestic social gathering. He copied the painted architecture, swags of fruit and leaves, hanging masks, and instruments from Romanfrescoesand based the floor marble andmosaicpatterns, window grill pattern, and theklismoschair type on Roman models. The statues copy examples in Roman public and private collections.By the late 1800s, such paintings of ancient Greece and Rome were very popular. Artists researched the elements of their settings and painted with careful photographicrealismto present plausible representations of daily life in classical times. Many of thesegenre scenesalso have erotic undercurrents, with languidly beautiful young women in the company of older men.
This elaborate timepiece demonstrates the level of astronomical knowledge of eighteenth-century French scientists. The large main dial is composed of overlapping circular plates and three hands that indicate the time with a twenty-four hour chapter ring, the months of the year and their zodiacal signs, the days of the lunar month, and the local time in various cities and parts of the world, includingLa Californie.The four smaller dials grouped above show the phases of the moon, a tidal calendar for the ports of Northern France, the days of the week, and the times of the eclipses ofJupiter'sfirst moon, Io. On the top of the case, a gilt-wood orrery shows the relative positions and motions of bodies in the solar system.Very few such elaborate clocks have survived to the present. Unfortunately this clock is no longer in working condition as the movement is entirely missing.
Ornament in the earlyNeoclassicalstyle, such as ram's heads, triglyphs, and guttae, overlay this clock case and its supporting bracket. The flaming urns, swags, and Greek key fretwork were allmotifscommonly used in thegot grec(Greek taste).The use of horn veneer painted red, green, and cream seems to be unique among French clocks and furniture; it may have been an attempt to imitatecloisonnenamel on Chinese bronzes.
The Greek orator Demosthenes summed up a symposion as  revelry, sex, and drinking.  An integral part of Athenian aristocratic society, a symposion was a social gathering at which men ate, drank, played party games, were entertained with music and dance, and had sex with female prostitutes, mistresses, or male youths. Thisred-figurecup explicitly depicts a sexual encounter between a young man and a woman who is probably a hetaira, or prostitute. Such erotic scenes frequently decorated vases like this drinking cup, designed for use at a symposion and in keeping with the tone of the evening. The symposion was an essential element of Athenian social structure. Athenian men did not marry until they were in their thirties, and the symposion provided an important sexual outlet. Even after marriage, usually an arranged pairing with an extremely sheltered fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl, a man probably spent little to no time with his wife. Marriage was designed to produce legitimate heirs; the symposion with its music, games, and hetairai was designed to produce pleasure.
Simon de Varie, who served in the French royal treasury under Charles VII and whom the king had recently raised to noble rank, commissioned a book of hours, which was completed in 1455. This richly illuminated private prayer book includes a calendar of church holidays and texts for devotional services inspired by the eight daily services of the divine office. The rise in literacy among the merchant and noble classes and their desire to express a newly emotional personal piety, particularly in veneration of the Virgin Mary, spurred the popularity of books of hours in the 1400s. In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.
Introducing the reader and viewer to Simon de Varie's exquisite book of hours, a woman holds up an escutcheon, or shield, in the first illumination of the book's series of frontispiece miniatures. With its profusion of heraldry, Jean Fouquet designed this page to emphasize not only Varie's piety but also his pride in his lofty new status: Varie had only been ennobled shortly before he commissioned this manuscript.The shield was overpainted in the 1600s with thearmsof the Bourbon-Cond family but originally held Varie's arms. The banner supporting the shield displays Varie's motto:Plus que jamais(More than ever) andVie  mon desir(Life according to one's desire). Cleverness is the rule here: in the writing of theAandMthe letters are joined together in a monogram, and the second phrase forms an anagram of Simon de Varie's name.Inspired by his contact with ItalianRenaissancepainting, Fouquet painted the woman as a sturdy, three-dimensional figure. Modeling the volumes of her body on simple geometric forms--spheres for the turban and head and cones for her lower body and the individual folds of her dress--he imbued the scene with calm monumentality.
In the second frontispiece image of this book of hours, the Virgin Mary and Jesus sit enthroned. On the facing page, the manuscript's patron Simon de Varie kneels in homage. Together these two miniatures function like a diptych, a two-part hinged altarpiece. The image of Varie in prayer before the Virgin testifies to his personal devotion to her. It is also particularly appropriate as an introduction to Varie's personal book of hours, for in reciting his prayers he pays homage to the Virgin, much as he is pictured in prayer before her.Jean Fouquet's simple presentation gives this scene its grandeur. The Virgin and Child sit in three-quarter profile in a room defined only by its receding tile floor and deep red curtains. The Virgin's long golden hair, fine facial features, and narrow shoulders give her a youthful and delicate appearance, drawing on the contemporary ideal of female beauty. On the other hand, her erect posture and the fullness of her expansive robe convey a regal and powerful presence. Fouquet enlivened the dominant colors--shades of blue for the Virgin and Child's gowns and red for the wall hangings--with shimmering gold highlights.
As part of the multi-page frontispiece to his personal prayer book, the patron, Simon de Varie, kneels in prayer to the Virgin. She appears in the miniature on the facing page, enthroned with the baby Jesus. Although not a soldier, Varie wears armor and a surcoat decorated with the fleur-de-lis. Behind him a female attendant supports a shield crowned with his family emblems, while similar coats of arms, now partially overpainted, and Varie's personal mottoes decorate the border. These signs of his new noble status are clearly significant to Varie, who rose from the merchant class through his work as an official in the French royal treasury.Although the artist Jean Fouquet presented Simon and the Virgin in separate miniatures, he linked the interior spaces of the two illuminations. The floor tiles on both pages share the same vanishing point, so that the lines of recession suggested by the floor tiles converge at a point between the two miniatures. This device suggests that, despite the red curtain behind the Virgin and the blue curtain behind Varie, the figures occupy the same room.
A woman and dog hold heraldic devices on the fourth miniature in the series of frontispiece illuminations painted by Jean Fouquet for Simon de Varie's book of hours. The figures support an escutcheon, or shield, which was repainted in the seventeenth century with fleur-de-lis but originally presented Varie's arms. This shield is crowned with the Varie helmet and crest.Scrolls at top and bottom display Varie's mottoes in elegant capitals. At the top and on the dog's collar, the phraseVie  mon desir(Life according to one's desire) incorporates the second letterIwithin theV, and theDbites theEthat follows it. This motto is an anagram of the patron's name, Simon de Varie.Plus que jamais(More than ever) unfurls on the bottom scroll. As with the manuscript's other heraldic images, this miniature celebrates Varie's new station in life, one that gave him access to the use of heraldry, restricted to the noble classes. Varie's high position at court gave him the financial means to commission this kind of book.
These panels once served as wings of a portablealtarpieceused for private devotion. The left panel showsSaint Francis, who is recognized by thestigmataon his hands, feet, and side. The three knots tied in the sash around his waist symbolizing his Franciscan Order's three religious vows: poverty, chastity, and obedience. An unidentifiedbishopsaint wearing acopeandmiterand holding acrozierstands to the left of Francis.The right panel depictsSaint John the Baptist, who is identified by his reed cross and tunic of animal skins, andSaint Dominic, who wears the habit of hisDominican Order. He holds a lily, the symbol of chastity, and carries a book of the Gospels.The DominicanmonkFra Angelico, whose clerical name means  Angelic Brother,  was among the first to adopt Masaccio's innovativenaturalism. Though he still employed a goldbackground, Fra Angelico used shading to model plausible figures in the round. These paintings epitomize his particular delicacy of color, sensitivity of expression, and ability to convey the spiritual grace of saints.
A tall tree with outstretched branches and a broad canopy of leaves fills the full expanse of this sheet. Fra Bartolommeo captured the trunk's gnarled form using small flecks of black chalk, later carefully reworking the branch at the right in brush and brown ink. He constructed two smaller, bushier trees at the left with broad parallel strokes of chalk that simulate the lacy, atmospheric effect of light passing through leaves.Fra Bartolommeo was clearly fascinated by the contorted and variegated forms of tree trunks and the patterns and texture of leaves. He produced many tree studies, of which this is the largest one to have survived. One of the first artists to draw nature for its own sake, he worked outdoors with a sketchbook so as to observe in minute detail and understand the effects of light. Although similar trees do appear in the backgrounds of the artist's paintings, this work was probably created as an independent study for his own use and enjoyment. Fra Bartolommeo's nature studies would have been kept in the workshop and used as reference material for painting.
The Virgin Mary and Joseph convey a sense of calm as they rest on a golden late summer afternoon, watching as the Christ Child grasps the infant John the Baptist's reed cross. Fra Bartolommeo evokes Christ's Passion in a variety of ways in this painting. The palm tree on the left suggests the palm fronds that would pave Christ's final entry into Jerusalem, while the pomegranate, lying on the ground in front of Mary, is a symbol of his Resurrection. In the background on the right, Fra Bartolommeo represented the family fleeing Bethlehem to avoid King Herod's massacre of the innocents.
As evidenced by the chalk grid, Fra Bartolommeo was well along in the design of his composition for the Getty Museum's painting,The Rest on the Flight into Egypt with St. John the Baptist,by the time he made this drawing. He had squared this sheet for enlargement onto the cartoon, the final stage before beginning to paint, which incorporated all the elements of pose, movement, and lighting.In this study, Fra Bartolommeo settled on the lighting, choosing to illuminate the infant from the rear while leaving the front of his body in shadow, is just as in the later painting. Saint John the Baptist's stiff, forward-leaning posture was an important part of the painting's pyramid of figures, a typical High Renaissance arrangement that contributed greatly to the drawing's sense of calm stability.
In 1510 the Florentine republic commissioned Fra Bartolommeo to paint an altarpiece,Madonna and Child with Saints,for one of the long walls of the council chamber in the Palazzo Vecchio. Battle scenes painted by rivals Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were supposed to flank the altarpiece, though only Leonardo ever began his painting. Fra Bartolommeo never finished his monochrome altarpiece either, though he was still working on it in 1515.Fra Bartolommeo used chalk to softly indicate areas of light and shadow as well as to work out other elements of the unified composition, such as the placement of figures and their various poses. His concern withchiaroscuroshows Leonardo's influence.
Fra Bartolommeo used the chalk medium in all its soft expressiveness to create delicate modulations of light and shade. Through drawing he explored light effects, as well as the pose and attitude of his figures. His subtle effects of shadow andsfumatorecall the works of his Florentine predecessor Leonardo da Vinci. These chalk studies are characteristic of the drawings Fra Bartolommeo made in preparation for painted works, though they have never been connected with a particular painting.
A young woman stares sorrowfully at a palm branch in her left hand, the symbol of a martyr. Dressed in a long, flowing robe, she holds the edge of her cloak under her right arm as it has slipped from her shoulder. She is Saint Lucy, a virgin martyr from Syracuse in Italy, who died in about the year 304 for her beliefs as a Christian. Lucy survived numerous tortures such as having molten lead poured into her ears, having her teeth pulled and her breasts amputated, and being drenched with boiling oil and urine. Ultimately, she was killed by a dagger through her throat.Fra Paolino outlined the figure of the saint with black chalk, quickly correcting the lines of drapery at her back until he achieved the line he desired. He used tight lines of cross-hatching to give a sense of depth and shadow to the folds of fabric that pool at her feet. Curving strokes of white chalk give subtle highlights to the creases and folds of her garment.
As a student at the Acadmie de France in Rome, Jean-Honor Fragonard was encouraged to sketch Roman sites in the open air. In this view of the Palatine Hill's northeast corner, a site also sketched by his friend Hubert Robert and by Franois Boucher, Fragonard created a powerful visual momentum by coordinating the forward thrust of the corner of the palace, the brilliant sunlight, and the towering cypresses. The dynamic, plunging perspective of walls and trees and the intense light infuse the massive architecture with life.Fragonard masterfully used both chalk and paper to create the overall effect and the varied small passages. Overall, he worked the red chalk lightly yet broadly, allowing the white of the paper to come through even in areas of deepest shading. His controlled exposure of the paper's whiteness, the constant shift of direction and character in his shading strokes, and his inventive calligraphy describe sunlight, shadow, and texture in diverse ways.
A young woman clad only in a negligee kneels on her unmade bed, hands clasped in despair. As the drawing's title makes clear, she bemoans her lover's infidelity. With tongue-in-cheek humor, Jean-Honor Fragonard juxtaposed the woman's exaggerated distress with her dog's unwavering loyalty. The woman's pose, taken from representations of the penitent saint Mary Magdalene, the reformed New Testament courtesan traditionally depicted with long, flowing hair, further emphasizes the drawing's light, satirical tone.Fragonard's light, fluent washes also work to convey a sense of abandonment, evident especially in the wildly tossed-about bedclothes. These fluid passages contrast with the arresting precision of the woman's eye, nostril, and mouth, captured in small marks made with the point of the brush.In the later 1760s, Fragonard created a number of drawings devoted to erotic themes. He made this one as a study for an engraving.
One of the greatest draftsmen of all time, Fragonard is most famous for wash drawings such as this one. The frenzied joy of the scene, with its roaring fire and roiling mound of forms and faces, is matched by the surging energy with which he applied the media.Fragonard began with a flurry of rapid-fire graphite lines that map out the complex, multi-figured composition. In a second attack, he loaded his brush with numerous gradations of warm brown wash. A third vital component is his use of the white paper (called the reserve) for the highest lights. The three elements of the graphite, the wash, and the paper interact dynamically to create a sense of evanescent movement and enveloping atmosphere.
In the midst of a verdant forest, a young man and woman eagerly rush forward, their feet just reaching the edge of a fountain's basin. Putti frolic in the fountain's waters and billowing spray, and one of them offers a cup of the magical liquid for the young lovers to drink. The story of the Garden of Love, an allegory of the nature and progress of love that has its origins in the poetry of classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, centers on this Fountain of Love. The fountain brings forth the water in which Cupid dips his arrows or from which lovers drink and fall in love. In nearly every period, artists have painted this romantic motif. During the 1700s, artists came to treat the Fountain of Love almost as a genre subject, with lovers in contemporary dress flirting in a garden around a decorative fountain. With this version, Jean-Honor Fragonard returned the allegory to its classical origins and imbued it with the thrilling rush of those first beguiling moments of love. The quintessential Rococo artist, Fragonard responded to the Neoclassical movement in an extremely inventive manner, adding a soft, steamy atmosphere to his cameo-like figures.
Seated on a rock with his right hand supporting his head and with cankerous sores covering his naked body, the Bible figure of Job is a study in melancholy and resignation. The sense of Job's loneliness is further enforced by his isolation in the bottom half of the initialS. As described in the Bible, Job was afflicted with the loss of his wealth, family, friends, and health, but maintained his faith in God. Despite its rather depressing subject matter, the miniature is especially beautiful in the way the curving shapes of the cave spatially reinforce the curvilinear qualities of the letter itself.
The sensitively drawn face and hands of God the Father stand out in this otherwise brightly colored illumination. These parts are probably not unfinished, but rather may be one of the artist's many experiments in using tinted drawing as part of his illumination. This depiction of God the Father Blessing, showing him reaching out of the foliate initial, is unusual for a choir book, but it illustrates the office for the Monday after Easter, which makes frequent reference to God the Father. The leaf originally came from an antiphonal that belonged with a set of seventeen choir books that were made for the Augustinian abbey (the Badia) at Fiesole near Florence under the patronage of Cosimo de' Medici.
A chastisedCupidwith bound arms and clipped wings walks before a unicorn-drawn chariot carrying the enthroned figure of Chastity to her six-sided temple. At either end of the panel is a bird, possibly a swan, which also symbolized chastity, draped with anescutcheondisplaying acoat of arms. The arms belong to the Gabbrielli and Luti families, who celebrated a wedding in 1464.Artists often paintedcassoni,chests designed to carry a bride's trousseau, with such themes as the Triumph of Chastity, invoking the bride to honor the sanctity of marriage and warning her of the consequences if she did not.Cassonipanels such as this one also often featured processions, recalling the nuptial processions in which the chests traveled with the bride to her husband's home.The ethereal figures, delicate linearity, and intricate patterning of the scene betray Francesco di Giorgio Martini's origins in Siena.
With quick, confident strokes, Franciabigio captured a young man lost in thought as he writes or sketches in a notebook, his hip cocked to the right for balance. Using parallel hatching in black chalk, he indicated both the lighting and volume of the forms, simply by varying the length and curve of the same strokes. A few zigzagging stokes were all he needed to suggest the fabric of his cape and muscular legs.Franciabigio probably made the drawing from life, sketching a fellow artist or workshop assistant as he worked. The man wears clothing that was popular in the 1500s: a short doublet with a high stand-up collar, a short cloak, a codpiece, and breeches and stockings sewn together at the knee. His head sports a soft, low hat with a turned up brim, which could be worn both inside and out.
Wearing a magnificent silk robe with an ermine lining, King Solomon kneels and makes an offering to a paganidol. One of his wives appears to instruct him while several other concubines, lavishly dressed, stand behind. A group of men in elaborate headpieces and rich finery watch Solomon and the women from the left with displeasure, as if they know that Solomon's idol worship will eventually destroy his kingdom. The Temple of Jerusalem, which was erected under the King's reign, is under construction in thebackground.Solomon was known for his proverbial wisdom and great wealth. In his later years he was drawn more and more to the pagan cults, which were thought to have been introduced into Israel by the women who came from neighboring kingdoms to join his large harem.This subject was popular inProtestantcountries in the 1600s because it reflected Protestant disapproval of the Catholic Church's use of religious imagery, a practice that Protestants viewed as idolatrous.
Four seated women representing water, air, earth, and fire are surrounded by a lush landscape. The fish flowing from the water jug and the cornucopia of abundance cradled in the arms of the figure on the right correspond to the tactile elements of water and earth. The birds in the sky and trees and the accoutrements of battle in the foreground correspond to the intangible elements of fire and air. The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape.Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers. The widely admired Brueghel the Younger depicted the senses, the elements, or the seasons as allegories many times throughout his career, either together or individually, as in the pendant to this painting,Landscape with Ceres (Allegory of Earth).
The imposing figure of Saint Louis of Toulouse, and the horizontal band of curling leaves that extend above his head, form the shape of this initialT. Louis was the son of Charles II of Anjou, King of Naples (1288-1309), and educated by Franciscan friars, eventually joining their order. Saint Louis is shown here wearing a miter and holding a crozier (bishop's hat and staff), symbols of his appointment as bishop of Toulouse in 1296, along with the brown, hooded robe of a Franciscan friar, and a red cape covered with gold fleurs-de-lis, symbols of the French royal family. This leaf belonged to an antiphonal from a famous series of choir books commissioned by Cardinal Bessarion (about 1399 1408-1472), a papal representative in Bologna between 1450 and 1455. This volume also displayed the coat of arms of Borso d'Este, the first Duke of Ferrara, and a major patron of the arts in that city in the mid-1400s.
Elderly and bedridden, the Old Testament patriarch Isaac directs his eldest son, Esau, to hunt for venison. Isaac promises to give Esau his final blessing when he returns with the meal, but Esau's brother, Jacob, arrives first, dressed as a hunter, and steals the blessing. The biblical story from the book of Genesis that inspired this scene, and the chant that follows on this page, are read and sung during the Christian penitential season of Lent. The figures' brightly colored garments and the delicate gold highlights on the trees and grass are characteristic of Franco dei Russi's manuscript illumination.
David kneels in a mountainous landscape set against a darkened sky. He holds his harp in his left hand while raising the small white figure of his soul up to God, at upper left, with his right hand. Winged children, known asputti, climb through the colorful curling vines that fill the margins of the page. This impressive leaf is the frontispiece of the first volume of an antiphonal belonging to a famous series of at least fifteen choir books commissioned by Cardinal Bessarion (about 1399 1408-1472), who was a papal representative in Bologna between 1450 and 1455, and whose coat of arms appears in the lower margin of this page.
The three kings come to pay homage to the infant Christ in this wildly colorful scene. The blues, greens and violets of the ground and in the figures harmonize with the three colors of the decorative initial. The eldest king has removed his crown in recognition of Christ's superior rank and is about to kiss his feet in reverence. The Christ Child, who has accepted his gift, offers the king his blessing. The figure of the youngest king (the farthest to the right) stands out from the color scheme in his red tunic and cap, and his stocking labeled  DOM.  This may represent a contemporary figure dressed in courtly costume of the period, perhaps the patron. This initial from a choir book probably introduced the text of the Introit for the feast of the Epiphany:  E[cce advenit dominator Dominus...]  (Behold the lord the ruler is come...).
Elaborately decorated withemblemsand symbols of the patron's family, this terracottareliefwas made as a study for a large marble mirror frame. It would have been placed above the mantel in the second floor drawing room of the Braschi family's grand Italian palace in Rome. The artist, Francesco Antonio Franzoni, drew upon aclassicalvocabulary for the design, incorporatingputtiand Roman military objects around the frame. Military trophies adorn the relief, including a suit of armor, helmet, flags, shields, spears, axes, and the prow of a ship, referring to the family's illustrious political triumphs. The many religious emblems, such as achalice, cross,crozier, stole,miter, papal tiara, and keys of office were appropriate to this fireplace design because, as a member of the Braschi family, Pope Pius VI called this palace home.The loose handling of details apparent in the plumed helmet, the lion's face, and the military shields indicate that this was a preliminary sculptural sketch known as abozzetto.A nineteenth-century photograph shows the now-lost fireplace as it was eventually built, with green-and-white marble andgiltbronze emblems of the Braschi family.
Probably intended to display bronzes or other works of art in a private sculpture gallery, this table is a beautifully conceived work in the Neoclassical style. Classical motifs such as winged ram's heads and swags of laurel leaves have been imaginatively combined for the pier supports, which stand on elegantly formed plinths. They support a top made of an extraordinarily large and thick slab ofbreccia Mediceamarble, a spectacular specimen displaying purple, red, and white chunks of stone obtained from a quarry operated by the Medici family in the Apuan Alps.
His head bowed, a man walks alone in the silvery, cold moonlit night while contemplating a megalithic tomb and its implicit message of death. It is winter, and all around him nature is dying. Leafless trees loom behind like specters, but a grove of verdant oaks rises through the mist in the background with the promise of life. The waxing moon, high in the sky, also acts as a counterbalance to death, symbolizing Christ and the promise of rebirth for the artist Caspar David Friedrich.Friedrich was part of the German Romantic movement; his deeply personal and introspective vision addressed Christian themes through analogies based on the cycles of nature.A Walk at Duskwas among a small group of works Friedrich completed before he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1835. The painting embodies both the melancholy he experienced during this period and the consolation he found in the Christian faith.
They are not just men running in a landscape; they are fugitive also--either running away from something or running to something.--Elisabeth FrinkCaptured mid-stride, this tall, lithe figure pushes forward toward an unknown destination. His wiry limbs highlight his athleticism and potential for speed, but also convey fragility. His nakedness, as well as the sculpture's pocked surface, reinforces this vulnerability. A minimally defined face reveals only an impassive expression--this is a human figure outside of time or place.Elisabeth Frink traced her interest in sculpting the male figure back to World War II. As a child, her family lived near an airfield that was visited frequently by Polish airmen who struck her as foreign and mysterious. According to the artist, many of her representations of men were influenced by these early memories and consequently she treated the male body as withheld, mysterious, and threatening.  In addition to producing many male busts, Frink created imposing, essentially anonymous men in a variety of poses or guises--standing, seated, spinning, winged, and on horseback. She began a series of running men in the mid-1970s. In this series, Frink explores and exploits the tension between strength and vulnerability, feeling and suffering.
This life-size horse conveys the strength, speed, and vitality of a racehorse. Robust, rounded joints compliment its solid, muscular body. With its long neck extended, head turned to one side, its ears pointed forward, and confident stride, the animal appears alert to its surroundings. But the marked divots, incisions and striations covering the form's surface remind the viewer that this impressive horse is cast in heavy bronze.Elisabeth Frink's affection for horses stemmed from her country childhood in Sussex, England. Her father was a skilled horseman and an amateur jockey, which added to an enthusiasm that continued throughout her life. But it was only when she moved to France in the late 1960s that Frink began creating sculptures of horses. She would continue to explore this subject for many years often representing a horse and male rider.This sculpture was made from a plaster cast created in 1980. The form was originally commissioned for a Sussex racecourse. Frink claimed that her sculptures of horses were about  the ancient spirit of the horse and its evolution in relation to man. 
When Francis Frith made this photograph, thesphinxat Giza was buried almost to its neck in desert sand. He may or may not have been aware that beneath that sand lay the 150-foot long body of a lion. Frith perfectly centered the Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx in thecomposition, including a few figures in theforegroundto provide a sense of scale.The pyramids and sphinx at Giza, widely published now, were an astounding site to any viewer in the 1800s. Shortly after the development of photography, people began to dream about the landscape, architecture, and people of far away places--all of which seemed exotic andromantic. All along the Nile, Frith made 16 x 20-inch mammoth plate images, which he subsequently compiled and sold in enormous leather-bound albums.
Over a period of three years, court scribe David Aubert wrote a four-volume work in French titledHistoire de Charles Martel.It totals four thousand pages and tells the story of Charles Martel (r. 719 to 741),Charlemagne'sgrandfather. Late medieval knights undoubtedly enjoyed reading the adventures of such earlier heroes, and they would have drawn inspiration from Charles's exploits.Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, commissioned this enormousmanuscriptfor his already sumptuously endowed library of more than seven hundred volumes, one of the great libraries of the 1400s.Several years after Philip's death, theilluminationof this extravagant undertaking had barely begun. In 1468 ducal accounts show payments to Pol Fruit of Bruges for painting the initials in the third volume. A year or so later, Philip's son and heir DukeCharles the Boldhired Loyset Lidet to paint the book's 123miniatures. Court accounts record that Lidet received his final payment in 1472, showing that the entire manuscript took almost a decade to complete.The four volumes of the book, with 101 of the original miniatures, belong to the Royal Library in Brussels, which acquired the core of Philip the Good's library. Fifteen leaves with half-page miniatures, removed in the 1700s, are part of the Getty Museum's collection.
Richly dressed in an ermine-collared cloak and magnificent crown, theByzantineemperor emerges from the city of Constantinople on a white horse, surrounded by members of his court. A religious procession, including a group of clerics singing from open books, precedes him. The emperor appears again in thebackgroundat the right, this time greeting the Europeans who disembark from their boat after their long journey. As therubricjust below theminiatureexplains, in the 800s Girart de Roussillon and Charles Martel went to assist the Emperor of Constantinople in his battles with the Saracens. When Loyset Lidet painted this miniature in the 1400s, the subject had a special resonance: the recent Turkish capture of Constantinople in 1453 recalled theSaracenincursions and prompted calls for Europeancrusadersto rescue the city.
The political conflicts of Duke Philip of Burgundy, who commissioned thismanuscript, withKing Charles VIIof France, paralleled the manuscript's account of earlier French struggles. In this image, the armies of the Frankish ruler Charles Martel and his rebellious Burgundian vassal Girart de Roussillon wait with tense expectancy for a new battle to begin. The two armies face each other, their strength indicated by the sea of helmets that extends into the distance on either side. Charles kneels in prayer before his army, displaying the French fleur-de-lis on his clothing, on his horse's trappings, and on the banner behind him.
Thisminiaturefrom theHistory of Charles Martelillustrates events in the story of Charles's rivalry with the powerful Burgundian duke, Gerard de Roussillon. As Gerard and his wife Bertha journey to Hungary, bandits steal everything, even their horses, and leave the couple desperate. On the left, a hermit stands before his simple retreat and offers them food and lodging. On the right, the duke and his wife find a spring from which to drink. Loyset Lidet  used apaletteof bright colors to tell the story in his illustrations, evoking the splendor of contemporary Burgundian court dress.
Charles Martel was an early ruler of France, and Duke Gerard de Roussillon was his Burgundian vassal. In the 700s, the duke came to Martel's aid, saving him from death in a battle against the Saracens. When this book was made in the 1400s, such a battle between East and West had great relevance: theOttomanTurks, heirs to the Muslim Saracens, had just conquered Constantinople, putting an end to theByzantineEmpire and Christian rule in the east. The scene of the earlier battle would have reminded European viewers of this recent conquest and their long-time enemies, the Turks.
In thisminiaturefrom theHistory of Charles Martel,the army of Lorraine, led by Count Arnault, and the forces of Burgundy, led by his wife Lydia and her two sons, are about to begin a battle. The Burgundians stand in thebackgroundat the left, under the banner of the double eagle andBORDEAUS,while the forces of Lorraine mass at the right. In theforeground, the leaders of the opposing forces meet on horseback in advance of the fighting.Loyset Lidet and Pol Fruit depicted this scene not as an event from the past but in terms of the pageantry and splendor of late medieval court life. Lydia sits sidesaddle upon her horse, fashionably dressed in the elegant style of the Burgundian court of the later 1400s.
Sitting on an elaborately upholstered throne covered with fleurs-de-lis, Charles Martel's son Pepin the Short receives his crown as king of the Franks in 751. The papal legate Boniface, in red at the left, and a pair of Frankish bishops at either side of Pepin performed the ceremony at Soissons. Among the splendidly attired nobles in attendance was  the powerful duke Henry of Metz  mentioned in the text below, probably the figure in the ermine-trimmed cape at the far right.Theilluminator, Loyset Lidet, gave the scene the look of a coronation of his own time rather than of seven hundred years earlier. The pageantry would have held a special appeal for an aristocratic, late medieval viewer.
In a typically Sienese manner, Bernardino Fungai mingled elements ofGothicart--atooledgold background--with the newRenaissanceideas of three-dimensionality. Fungai presented the hermit saints in three-quarter view to display his knowledge of the new concept offoreshortening, yet he retained a typically Sienese interest in decorative patterning, as seen in the Virgin's elaborate drapery. He tilted Christ's paintedhaloinperspective, but he incised those of the saints and the Virgin into thebackground. Fungai also effectively employed the characteristic linear harmonies of Sienese art in the gentle contours of the docile Virgin's mantle, the subtle scallops of her white headgear, the fluttery end of Christ's transparent drapery, and the saints' wavy beards.
Johann Heinrich Fuseli once told student Benjamin Haydon:  [A] subject should interest, astonish, or move; if it did none of these it was worth nothing, by God. Dramatically lit behind dark, parted curtains, a group of figures encircle an old man and brutally stab him. Starkly opposing areas of dark and light intensify the drama: the paper's brilliant whiteness contrasts with the black curtains and the murderers' menacing shadows. This drawing typifies the horrific scenes in which Fuseli specialized.Fuseli selected his themes from literature, but his idiosyncratic interpretation can make it difficult to identify exact subjects. The curtain creates the stagelike effect, which, along with the linear, abstract representation of monumental figures, recall Fuseli's Shakespearean drawings of the early 1770s, made during his years in Italy. Theclassicizingrepresentation of the figures may have been inspired by the Hellenistic sculptureNiobid Groupin the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.
Anne Thistlewaite, the Countess of Chesterfield, appears lost in thought as she sits with her left arm resting on aplinth. Dense foliage furnishes a backdrop for her figure, while the right half of the painting provides a distant, unobstructed view of her lands. A pale beige shawl trimmed with gold fringe wraps loosely around her back and shoulders, and dainty white slippers emerge from underneath her elaborate blue satin gown. Her fashionable upswept hair and low-cut gown reveal the graceful curve of her neck and breast.Among Thomas Gainsborough's many portraits of English aristocrats, this large painting stands out as a remarkably loose and freely painted example. He conveyed a sense of immediacy in the large sweeping brushstrokes used to describe material, foliage, andbackgroundsky. Short, curved brushstrokes form the tree trunk, while longer strokes of blue and white paint create an illusion of shimmering, rustling fabric. Small dabs of white and gold paint applied to the shawl lend it a rich, glimmering effect.
A charming and persuasive speaker, James Christie founded the fine arts auction house in London that still bears his name. He was a close friend and neighbor of Thomas Gainsborough, who painted this portrait. Gainsborough depicted the cultivated auctioneer leaning on one of the artist's own landscape paintings and holding a piece of paper in his right hand, perhaps an auction list. Christie wears a sober brown frock suit, a white linen shirt, and a formal wig. On the little finger of his left hand is a signet ring, and two pendant seals dangle from watches worn about his waist. His dress and jewelry befit a cosmopolitan English gentleman of the 1770s.ThePortrait of James Christiehung in a place of honor at Christie's auction house in London until it was sold in 1846. The auction house was a gathering place for collectors, dealers, and fashionable society. The portrait immortalized the auctioneer and perpetuated his association with Gainsborough, who was one of England's most famous portrait painters.
Thomas Gainsborough painted the fourth Earl of Essex presenting a silver cup to Thomas Clutterbuck, a member of a prominent local family and also sheriff of the English county of Hertfordshire. In a letter to Clutterbuck that originally accompanied the cup, the Earl of Essex expressed his gratitude and regard for his friend:It has long been my inclination to give you a small token of the regard I have for you, and hope this Cup which I desire y[ou]r acceptance of, will be agre[e]able to you, & that you will consider it as a small token, or proof how much I think myself indebted to you, & of an esteem which I shall always retain.In 1784 the Earl of Essex commissioned the painting by Gainsborough to commemorate the presentation of the cup, which had actually taken place twelve years earlier. He then gave the painting to Clutterbuck. The two families maintained close ties throughout the nineteenth century, and the silver cup is still in the Clutterbuck family's possession. The painting, although it was paid for by the earl, also remained with the family until the Getty Museum purchased it in 1972.
Although their identity is unknown, the lady and child strolling through a park are probably portraits of specific members of English high society. The woman wears a large picture hat, and her hair flows in loose ringlets over her shoulder, a hairstyle very much in vogue in England between 1785 and 1790. Sweeps of black chalk with fresh whiteheighteningsuggest the lightness of the woman's step and the sense of breeze blowing through her skirts and gently agitating the surrounding foliage.Thomas Gainsborough probably made this drawing as a study forThe Richmond Water-Walk,a painting commissioned byKing George IIIof England that was apparently never executed. The painting was to feature stylish ladies of the day promenading along the banks of the River Thames in London. To prepare for the painting, Gainsborough made sketching trips to St. James's Park near his London home to draw the  high-dressed and fashionable ladies  he saw there. This drawing was very likely made on such a trip.
A hot air balloon inspired the design of this fanciful chandelier with a blue lacquered globe strewn with gold stars above a glass bowl. The twelve signs of the zodiac wrap around the globe on a gilt bronze band. The maker, Grard-Jean Galle, fitted the bowl with a plug and explained that it could hold water and small goldfish,  whose continuous movement amuses the eye most agreeably.  When he exhibited the chandelier in 1819, he described it as alustre  poisson(fish chandelier).Galle tried to sell this chandelier along with other merchandise to the French King Louis XVIII in 1820. He desperately pleaded that these goods caused  the ruin of my factory and family  and promised that his stock was modestly priced, but the government rejected his offer. Conscious of popular criticism of governmental luxury, the bureaucrats argued that they could not purchase objects that were neither  advantageous nor useful. 
In this depiction of the lamentation ofChrist, Fernando Gallego looked to Northern European paintings for inspiration but included distinctly Spanish elements such as a subduedpaletteand unidealized figures. Unlike Netherlandish artists who were interested in depicting the natural world in minute detail, Gallego concentrated on the piet's psychological and emotional impact, eliminating extraneous or distracting elements.TheVirgin Marysits in front of the cross, gazing at her dead son in her lap. On the ground around them are several pebbles, a bone, and a skull. A lance and a rod with attached sponge, two instruments from the Passion, lean perfectly vertically against the cross, which is inscribed with the initialsi.n.r.i.Behind the cross a rocky landscape overlooks aGothicwalled town, settled between a body of water and verdant countryside that stretches into the far distance.Gallego focused on the moment after theCrucifixionwhen overwhelming anguish gave way to resigned misery, the sentiment evident in the grief-stricken face of the Virgin, flushed and swollen from weeping. Christ's broken and emaciated body, his eyes unseeing, stretches awkwardly across her lap. Their exaggerated and unidealized features intensify the pathos central to the theme of the piet.
Commessocan best preserveantiquityand memory...and can resist all the battles of water and wind and other mishaps of fortune and of time.Thus Giorgio Vasari wrote ofcommesso,a newly revived antique technique for making pictures with cut stone.His comments suggest thatFerdinando I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, commissioned this portrait ofPope Clement VIIIin 1601 to preserve the pope's memory, since he honored antique culture and learning. The rigidity of themosaicmedium and the luminescence of the stones, which were thought to carry intrinsic symbolic values, give the image an austere power.Pictorial representations in stone mosaic had been popular in ancient Greece and Rome and recently revived inRenaissanceItaly. Images made of hard- and softstonecommessiwere much admired in theMedici court, particularly by Ferdinando, who founded a court workshop in which local craftsmen could be trained in the technique. Portraits in this medium, however, are exceedingly rare; this is one of only two surviving works from a group of four.
Sugar was a rare commodity until the end of the 1500s and continued to be expensive long after that time. With a certain amount of ceremony, it was sprinkled in powdered form on fruit or other desserts from casters such as these unusually large ones.The silversmith Simon Gallien followed a traditional form for these casters, decorating them with flower blossoms in high relief, scrolls, and trelliswork piercing, all typical features of the Rococo style.
At the very center of this elaborate,illusionisticdesign for a ceiling stands theVirgin Mary, on a bank of clouds supported by threeputti. She seems to float at the top of several tiers. At the bottom level, winged angels hold back fabric draped over the enormous ogee arches. Above the arches, the walls are decorated with scrolled brackets andmedallionscontaining portraitbusts. On the next level, Doric columns support an ornatecofferedceiling. The Virgin's image appears to be set into an oval panel above this ceiling.Lattanzio Gambarra used this drawing as apreparatory studyfor the ceiling of amonasticchurch near the Italian town of Cremona. He and an architectural painter received the commission in 1568, but they probably never began the work since the whole ceiling was destroyed in 1573.
When the roll-top is raised, a writing slide may be pulled forward, revealing dummy drawer fronts that match the interior desk drawers above. Additional writing slides pull out at the sides, perhaps for assistants to take dictation. The desk was originally designed to sit in the middle of a room, where it could be seen from all sides; the gilt bronze mounts that decorate the lowerfriezeonce continued around the back.ThebnisteBernard Molitor, who made this desk, received many commissions from the French court. Although scholars are unsure exactly who commissioned this grand piece, an entry in a sale catalogue of 1800, when it was sold at auction, described it as having come from the royal chteau of Saint-Cloud. A further clue to its original owner are the very small fleurs-de-lis, symbol of the monarchy, stamped on the drawer handle of the center drawer.
A motorcade carrying John F. Kennedy through Mexico City was a newsworthy event of social and political significance and thus a natural subject for the photojournalist Hctor Garca. In this image, Garca captured the festive mood of a tickertape parade along Avenida 20 Noviembre during Kennedy's 1962 visit to Mexico. Kennedy made this trip to promote the Alliance for Progress, a plan for developing the economies of Latin American nations.Garca's interest in events of political significance arose from his desire to portray social injustice and the plight of the urban poor. He has spent much of his life working as a photojournalist for Mexican and international publications, making documentary images with an eye for social content.
On a median strip along a busy boulevard in Mexico City, a young girl crouches beside a utility pole while a car speeds by. A large cup sits adjacent to her, probably for collecting charity. No parent or older sibling appears to be nearby to keep an eye on this vulnerable child who has been placed in a frightening and dangerous position. Hctor Garca's photograph depicts the struggle of one of Mexico's poorest social classes through the eyes of a seemingly abandoned young girl.To make this portrait, Garca employed a straightforward photographic approach, framing the picture from inside a passing car. Thisperspectiveis in keeping with his objective of capturing the plight of the urban poor with honesty and without embellishment.
Twenty-six thousand soldiers were killed or wounded in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, after which Confederate General Robert E. Lee was forced to retreat to Virginia. Just two weeks after the victory, President and Commander-in-Chief Abraham Lincoln conferred with General McClernand and Allan Pinkerton, Chief of the nascent Secret Service, who had organized espionage missions behind Confederate lines.Lincoln stands tall, front and center in his stovepipe hat, his erect and commanding posture emphasized by the tent pole that seems to be an extension of his spine. The other men stand slightly apart in deference to their leader, in postures of allegiance with their hands covering their hearts. The reclining figure of the man at left and the shirt hanging from the tree are a reminder that, although this is a formally posed picture, Lincoln's presence did not halt the camp's activity, and no attempts were made to isolate him from the ordinary circumstances surrounding the continuing military conflict.
Slowly, over the misty fields of Gettysburg--as all reluctant to expose their ghastly horrors to the light--came the sunless morn, after the retreat by [General Robert. E.] Lee's broken army. Through the shadowy vapors, it was, indeed, a  harvest of death  that was presented; hundreds and thousands of torn Union and rebel soldiers--although many of the former were already interred--strewed the now quiet fighting ground, soaked by the rain, which for two days had drenched the country with its fitful showers.This paragraph opens the text that Alexander Gardner wrote to accompany this photograph inGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.Both text and image eloquently capture the war's toll of death and destruction, especially apparent after the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863. Although Gardner's caption identifies the men in the photograph as  rebels represented...without shoes,  they are probably Union dead. During the Civil War, shoes were routinely removed from corpses because supplies were scarce and surviving troops needed them.
The dead shown in the photograph were our own men. The picture represents only a single spot on the long line of killed, which after the fight extended across the fields....The faces all were pale, as though cut in marble, and as the wind swept across the battle-field it waved the hair, and gave the bodies such an appearance of life that a spectator could hardly help thinking they were about to rise to continue the fight.Thus Alexander Gardner vividly described the aftermath of the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, where Timothy O'Sullivan photographed the fallen Union dead. General Reynolds was killed during the battle and had already been removed from the field. O'Sullivan made the photograph while working for Gardner, who printed the image and included it in hisGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.
This gruesome scene depicts the unpleasant job of burying the remains of fallen Union soldiers from the June 1864 battles of Gaines' Mill and Cold Harbor. This task has fallen to a group of black men doing the menial work while a white man standing at upper left acts as overseer. The man seated in the center, next to the stretcher laden with human parts, looks directly at the camera, revealing no emotion that can be reconciled with his grisly cargo.Already reduced to nothing more than a pile of bones, these bodies lay unburied for ten months until the war's end, while the blistering heat and humidity of the Virginia summer hastened their decomposition. Local residents usually came forth to give a proper burial to the enemy troops that fell near their homes, but the scale of the casualties here--nearly sixty thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded in this area--precluded this courtesy.
A young girl in a prim white dress stands out in this seemingly spontaneous group portrait of passengers disembarking from railroad cars on a prairie in the midwest. The lack of a proper station platform, however, suggests that some passengers remained aboard the train and that this was a momentary stop to produce a contrived image. The conspicuous absence of women in the image is also a reminder that pioneering was primarily done by men: in 1850 only 7,000 of California's 94,000 residents were women.Alexander Gardner made this photograph two years before the completion of the transcontinental railroad, when the railroad companies were investing heavily in advertising. Many companies hired photographers to produce large images such as this one along their routes for documentary and promotional purposes. To create a sense of movement echoing the exciting advance of the train across the landscape, Gardner positioned his camera directly on top of the rails, with the Union Pacific train boldly emerging from the left and receding across thepicture plane.
Although the setting for this railroad bridge appears serene, the impending arrival of a large, noisy steam engine could, at any moment, destroy its tranquility. Railroads connected people to places far and wide, but in passing through remote regions they altered once-pristine landscapes. Overcoming geological obstacles, like this narrow body of water, was a significant feat. The locomotive's path required bridges, trestles, tunnels, and other engineering constructions for the  iron horse  to run smoothly.Alexander Gardner made this image while documenting the construction of a rail line to California for the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads.
Following his tour of duty as a Civil War photographer, Alexander Gardner headed west. Construction of a transcontinental railroad became a national priority after the destructive years of war, and Gardner followed its course. He photographed the Eastern Division of the Union Pacific Railroad as it stretched across Kansas from the Missouri River to its junction with the main line at Hays City, Kansas.Small figures punctuate the barely discernible flatbed cars that link the engine and caboose and span the entire length of the trestle bridge. They seem to merge with the bridge itself, transforming the train-and-bridge into a chain pulled taut across the hilly landscape. Additional tiny figures, including a lone man in the near distance who watches the photographer intently, pepper the ground below, as though cast off by the train.
In 1867 the Kansas Pacific and Union Pacific railroads hired Alexander Gardner to document the building of a rail route to Calfornia. While in Kansas, Gardner photographed the local line, the Leavenworth, Lawrence, and Galveston Railroad. Here a large group of men gathers upon and around a steam engine that has just traversed a bridge across the Kaw River. Gardner included a large aqueduct on the right, which cast a dark, pierced shadow over the river's barren near shore. A picturesque row of buildings and largely leafless trees lines the riverbank in the distance. Unlike most phototgraphs documenting railroads and railroad construction in the 1800s, this image was made in an area already inhabited by settlers.
On a bleak midwestern prairie, Alexander Gardner photographed workers laying track for the Union Pacific Railroad. A close look at the labor force reveals the cultural diversity of workers employed by the railroad companies, who advertised far and wide for able-bodied, adventurous men.In theforeground, parallel wooden cross-ties are being laid in preparation for the iron track. Once the track was laid, the supply engine in thebackgroundcould move forward. This ongoing system continued until the Union Pacific reached Promontory Summit, Utah, where it joined the Central Pacific rails that had been laid eastward from Sacramento, California. The meeting of the rails marked the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States.
The attentive gaze of a cat sitting in a window confronts the viewer over windblown tendrils on a neglected picket fence. Strong vertical architectural elements frame the view and draw attention to everyday backyard objects: a barbecue, patio chairs, and a birdbath. Integrating multiple textures and angles into a unified whole, Rhea Garen makes her landscape into a form of meditation. Garen titled the imageCascadilla Street Cat,suggesting that a living creature is a more important indicator of a neighbor's life than backyard paraphernalia.
A large tree shelters--and at the same time overwhelms--a house. The lush greens of summer suffuse this scene, even as the brown leaves pasted in the second-story window recall the previous autumn. An obliquely viewed street sign in the foreground divides the house and introduces a cautionary note to the scene. While the tree provides summer shade, an adjoining woodpile suggests the approach of winter and the tree's ultimate fate. Rhea Garen photographed this house near a creek she passed by every day while walking her dog. Interested in the way a place changes with the seasons, Garen often returns to a site to photograph it at different times of the year.
An ardent conservationist, Garnett became concerned about land use and air pollution in the early 1940s. He made this photograph in an attempt to raise public awareness. Over the years Garnett came to believe that he was more likely to inspire positive change by pointing out nature's enduring beauty than by showing the ugliness caused by poor choices.
Because of the precise timing and control needed to get the the pictures he wanted, Garnett had to learn to pilot a plane himself. In his hands, the airplane became an artistic tool. The majority of Garnett's photographs were taken at low speeds, while he balanced the wheel with his elbow and manipulated the rubber pedals with his feet. The stillness of his work belies the fact that it was photographed while he was in motion.
Trucks and tractors leave textured trails behind as former beet fields are leveled.
Stacked lumber appears for the foundations, utility poles are installed, and the main roads are carved out.
Whitish slabs of concrete flooring are poured and foundations built, transforming the landscape into a geometric pattern.
From above, the houses' exposed scaffolding resembles cages built of toothpicks.
As plaster is applied on the inside of the homes and roofing on the outside the housing development looks almost complete except for yards littered with building debris.
Completed homes glow in the raking light, their shadows traversing the distances between their rows.
I was hired commercially to illustrate the growth of that housing project. I didn't approve of what they were doing. Seventeen thousand houses with five floor plans, and they all looked alike, and there was not a tree in sight when they got through.--William GarnettLakewood, located on the outskirts of Los Angeles, was the location for the second major postwar housing development ever built in the United States. Some 17,500 tract houses were constructed assembly-line style on 3,500 acres of cleared farmland. Mass production made the houses affordable, so a greater number of people could take part in the American dream of home ownership.The developers hired William Garnett to document different phases of the subdivision's construction from his Cessna airplane. He often photographed his subjects early in the day, so the angled light would emphasize their otherwise flat-looking forms. The six photographs serve a utilitarian purpose and but also demonstrate Garnett's impeccable sense of design.
Height--aeronautical altitude--is like sudden wealth. It buys detachment and new perspective, with some beautiful lies thrown into the bargain. Solo flight in a small plane is an excellent way of leaving behind one's lesser thoughts and one's smaller ideas. A dreary stretch of fallow farmland, from the air; a chill and brutish mile of city slum, from a plane window: in a grand sweep, these become positively magnificent sights.--Walker Evans
To visually balance this image, Garnett burnt in a shadow in the lower left corner. While printing the image in the darkroom, he held something (perhaps a card) over the paper except at the corner. Because it was exposed to light longer, the corner darkened.
Gliding on a shaft of air in his Cessna 170-B plane, Garnett created a picture that resembles the work of Abstract Expressionist painters of the 1950s such as Clyfford Still and Robert Motherwell. While he pointed his camera out the window, Garnett maneuvered the plane until he could frame the perpendicular lines of the tank off-center, waiting until the dried ground in the empty tank looked like a mosaic of cracked paint before snapping the shutter.
Soda Lake covers an area of about three thousand acres and is one of the dominant features of the Carrizo Plain in San Luis Obispo County. With no outlet, the water evaporates, leaving behind a glistening expanse of carbonate salts that are shaped by strong winds. From above, the strange beauty of these salt deposits resembles flowing lava, and implicit reminder of the powerful forces of fire and ice that formed the earth.
A rectangle split by a series of bold diagonal lines and patterns, this composition is enhanced by subtle variations of tone: the lush vegetation of the field on the left set against the suntanned earth of the unplanted field to the right.
Landscape photographer Ansel Adams called Garnett's photographs  revelations  because they reveal a beauty and order that cannot be seen from an earthbound perspective. With sensitivity and care, Garnett selected the true subjects of this image: light, shadow, pattern, and line.
Dismayed by the destruction of a walnut grove in the San Fernando Valley that was being cleared for tract houses, Garnett returned to this location several times to make a series of photographs.

Blow out dunes are caused by high winds that blow away sand and uproot vegetation, thus widening the gaps between existing dunes and then destroying them. Resembing either a close-up of the peeled bark of a fir tree or a cross section of an ant colony, this crisp photograph is reminescent of nature studies made in the 1930s by photographers like Edward Weston and Albert Renger-Patzsch.
In this carefully composed view, Garnett captured the delicate, veinlike pattern formed by wind, water, and vegetation. The tiny black spots seen here are cacti and other desert plants. Garnett's pictures are compelling because, beyond being aesthetically pleasing, they inspire wonder and invite us to ask, what is it

Those lines are trails from one batch of vegetation to the other, because that's a dry lake area and the vegetation is in the little islands. ...I have a photographer friend who drove out and camped there, and he said  Early in the morning I see rabbits running from one place to the other.  The cattle were on a farm on the edge of that lake.--William GarnettThis photograph looks like it was made through a microscope. Whitish, amoebalike forms sprawl across the image, connected by weblike lines and clusters of black dots resembling nuclei. However, this image is not a view of microorganisms but a landscape photographed from the air.William Garnett made this image from the window of his Cessna airplane as he flew across the Carrizo Plain on one of his frequent flight paths. The plain is about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles.The land has a scalelike texture to it, and patchy shadows are cast from cloud formations above the plain. The more prominent dotted lines are cattle tracks and the straight lines are rabbit runs.Garnett's photographs, like this one, reveal landscape's natural beauty, which he could not otherwise make visible from an ordinary, earthbound perspective.
Mesas are low, flat-topped mountains with steep sides that are often home to the Hopi Indians. This image reveals the cracked and windblown topography of one of these unique geological formations and the surrounding terrain. The varied tones and strong contrasts hint at the vibrantly colored earth found in Arizona's Painted Desert.
Owens Lake is a very unique place in the United States. When the winter rains come, the lake fills with water; and when it dehydrates, it goes through several cycles. There's a little ponding of brine; it hasn't formed white crystals yet. Those will dry up before the year is out and turn white crystalline salt in place of that.--William GarnettMany of William Garnett's later photographs, like this one of Owens Lake, were shot in color. The orange-red diagonal shape resembles a flame with whitish edges, with surrounding hues ranging from cream to black. These colors indicate the presence of salt-eating microbacteria, representing a stage in the lake's annual cycle of flooding and drying out. Garnett made at least 100 images of Owens Lake during his career as an aerial photographer. Many of his commercial clients included geological and chemical industries, and the lake--located in the Mojave Desert--was along one of his frequent flight paths.Subjects like Owens Lake demonstrate Garnett's lifelong concern for the conservation of natural resources. The Owens Valley Aqueduct, built between 1908 and 1913, siphoned off the once-fertile valley's water for use by a growing Los Angeles population, creating an ecological disaster.
Inspired by a cross-country flight in 1945, Garnett learned to fly his own airplane and devoted himself to making aerial pictures of the landscape. His work reveals a beauty and order in the natural environment that cannot be seen from an earthbound perspective. Here he captured a wide expanse of sandbars along Cape Cod, including a white sailboat (at upper right) to ground the nearly abstract image with scale and perspective.
The plane is spare and cramped for a tall person like Garnett, the engine is loud, and the sound of rushing wind is persistent. Up there everything is the opposite of the calm, formality, stillness, and sense of complete control we see in the photographs, because in reality we were in constant motion, moving not just forward, but sometimes up, down, and sideways as the weather dictated.--Weston Naef on his experience flying with the artist
Here a farmer slowly changes the texture and shade of the terrain as he plows the field. Unaware that he is being photographed, he cannot see the overall pattern that he is bringing into being. The small size of the tractor within the expansive landscape invites the viewer to contemplate man's place in the world.
Channels of the Napa River meander over the delta marshland before emptying into San Pablo Bay. Here a filigree of graceful, fluid lines is brought to life by the shimmering light. The gradual darkening from top to bottom adds to the subtlety of the image.
While extremely decorative, this pair of triangular corner cupboards contains little space for storage. The cupboards are two feet wide and too shallow to function as pedestals for any but small sculptures. In addition, if they are not screwed to the wall, they will topple over when their heavy, four-foot-high doors are unlocked.Produced around 1765, these cupboards' straight lines and the forms of the gilt-bronzemountsexemplify the earliest phase of theNeoclassicalstyle. A major component of this style was the use of large-scalemotifsdrawn fromclassicalantiquity: rosettes, laurel garlands, a scrollingfrieze, and fluting down each side.This pair and two others, now missing, furnished the small mezzanine apartment inVersailles. Visitors to these rooms would have seen these strict Neoclassical objects as extremely avant-garde since they were produced at a time when other patrons were still acquiring furniture and objects in theRococostyle.
 Art . . . stands as a uniting link between the soul and nature, and can be apprehended only in the living center of both,  wrote philosopher Friedrich von Schelling in 1807. Artists such as Heinrich Johann Grtner, who used landscape to evoke religious and spiritual ideas, eagerly took up this tenet ofRomanticism.With a fine-nibbed pen and a virtuoso technique, Grtner painstakingly differentiated species while creating an ornamental forest of dense yet delicate layers of plants. But he portrayed more than plants: his diminutive humans express a contemplative spirituality in which humanity is both immersed in and one with nature. The shepherd tending his flock and the religious procession approaching a chapel with a graveyard also allude to earlier religions, both pagan and medieval. In a manner reminiscent of Caspar David Friedrich, whose Christian art was similarly based in nature, the forest is hushed and waiting.
At the center of this lush pleasure scene lounges Omphale, queen of Lydia, an ancient country bordering on the Aegean. After she bought Hercules, wearing his lion's pelt at the left, as a slave and her lover, he served her for three years, ridding the land of robbers and other pests and fathering at least three of her sons.In Luigi Garzi's mythological picture, ancient architecture mingles with contemporary clothing of the early 1700s. Despite the splendor of the architecture, Garzi achieved an intimate effect, partly through the many anecdotal elements: women lean in over the wall, a child plays with a tiny dog, and putti frolic to the music of Hercules' tambourine. Garzi successfully combined these light-hearted elements, typical of the Rococo, with High Baroque physicality and grandness of gesture.
Robust citrons with their leafy branches still attached fill a worn ceramic bowl to overflowing in this meticulous still life. Giovanna Garzoni's acute observation of nature and refined handling of paint are evident in the carefully rendered citron skin, and in the wasp's delicate wings. With its central bowl of fruit, this painting is characteristic of Garzoni's style; a single flower or insect placed in front of thepicture planeadds interest to thecomposition. Garzoni deliberately manipulated textures and shapes, contrasting the citrons' rough skin and rounded weightiness with the sharp-edged branches, the glistening, green leaves, and the delicate, star-like blossoms.Scientific research and illustration were of great interest to those who participated in court life in the 1600s. As a result, paintings ofnatura sospesa, nature suspended,  were quite fashionable. Garzoni's skillful depictions of natural objects, usually fruits and insects arranged in pleasing ensembles, were among the paintings most coveted by wealthypatrons.
Bernardino Gatti probably used a live model for this study of a monumental figure of one of Christ's apostles. To model the heavy folds of fabric that envelop the body, he applied a combination of hatched and cross-hatched lines. He indicated both the lighting and the volume of the cloth simply by varying the length and curve of the same strokes of hatching, then added a heavy layer of white and deep gray wash to give further depth to the rich draperies.Although the sheet is squared, which suggests that it was ready to be copied to another medium, severalpentimentistill remain. Gatti drew the apostle's exposed foot in two positions, moving his toes to the right to create a more balanced stance. He also experimented with the location of the figure's arms, lifting the raised one higher and changing the angle of the right arm and shoulder.
When Dutchman Christiaan Huygens invented the more accurate long-pendulum clock in 1657, other clock makers soon followed, adapting the design of their cases accordingly. In this early example, the pendulum and weights have been enclosed in a long case for protection. The center of the narrow body swells to allow for the pendulum's swing, and it has a viewing hole to observe the movement.A phrase from Virgil engraved beneath the dial--Solem audet dicere falsum(It dares the Sun to tell a lie)--alludes to the accuracy of this type of clock and its ability to demonstrate the irregularity of the sun's orbit.On the basis of the marquetry pattern, the case can be attributed to thebnisteAndr-Charles Boulle. The inventories of Louis XIV identify a clock of the same design and similar marquetry, now in the cole Nationale Suprieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris.
While still in his native France, Paul Gauguin yearned to escape the civilized society he knew. Wishing to imbue his art with a sense of primitivism, he sought refuge in a country he thought untouched by modern practices. Gauguin found the inspiration he was looking for in Colonial French Tahiti, where he made this life-size drawing of a rather defiant looking teenage girl. In the drawing, he boldly articulated her head, face, and neck, while indicating her shoulders and collar with lighter lines. But the girl's Western dress suggests that Tahiti was not the exotic land Gauguin had imagined: missionaries had destroyed its pre-European culture. Using flat, decorative forms, Gauguin presented Tahitian women as mysterious, unknowable creatures.
I have just finished a severed kanak [Pacific Islander] head, nicely arranged on a white cushion, in a palace of my invention and guarded by women also of my invention.--Paul GauguinWriting to his friend Daniel de Monfreid, Paul Gauguin referenced in an almost offhand way this startling painting of a decapitated human head, which he made during his first stay in Polynesia in the early 1890s. Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words  Arii  and  Matamoe  in the canvas' upper left. The first means  noble;  the second,  sleeping eyes,  a phrase that implies  death. The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic  primitivism.  In his collage-illustrated bookNoa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization.Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a  primitive  culture.
Paul Gauguin may have carved this almost life-sized head as a symbolic self-portrait. He made the sculpture while living in Tahiti, where he studied the native culture and, to a great extent, identified with the local people. Despite his pampered upbringing, Gauguin saw himself as a  savage,  untamed by the civilizing force of French society.In this mysterious sculpture, Gauguin's own features are suggested, combined with Polynesian attributes, such as a broad nose. The hypnotic eyes and the smooth, warm surface of the finely finished wood are captivating. To Western viewers, the sinister horns suggest evil; however, in Tahiti, this attribute resembles a style of hair--bunched in knots at either side of the head--worn by young men as an expression of power.This intriguing and complex sculpture was probably displayed in Gauguin's home in Tahiti, but it was lost sometime in the 1890s. Until its rediscovery in the 1990s,Head with Hornswas known only from two photographs that Gauguin pasted intoNoa Noa, a manuscript meant to explain his painting and Tahitian culture to his European contemporaries.
If my work must be limited to watercolor, pastel, or anything else all the spirit goes out of it ... I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all...--Paul GauguinNear the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see.On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages.Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive  printings,  Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve.Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of  the fall of man  enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions.This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.
Carved, painted, andgildedwood paneling(boiserie)formed the main decoration of walls in important eighteenth-century rooms. This room was originally used as a bedroom or largecabinetin a private Parisian home at number 18 place Vendme. In its original state, half of the room was paneled: the pier-glass, the window surrounds, and the fireplace wall. The back wall, where the bed was placed, was hung with fabric.Not all of the paneling from this room has survived, but the present installation approximates the room's original configuration. Additional modern panels, discernible by their lack of gilding, replace the lost elements. The floor, though old, is not contemporary with the room.
The painting's subject comes from theOld Testament: the first book ofSamuel, which describes the turning point in David's relationship withKing Saul. The priestAhimelechgives the sword of Goliath to the youngDavid, who won it in battle. When King Saul learned that this symbol of power had been given to David, he had Ahimelech murdered.The sleeve and headdress of the priest Ahimelech reveal scratches and uneven working of thepigmentso it catches the light in vivid contrastinghighlights. Aert de Gelder made these scratches with a paint knife or the end of a brush, which he often used to highlight the paint surface. De Gelder was a pupil of Rembrandt, and the influence of Rembrandt's late style is evident in his choice of half-length, life-size figures, muted colors, and expressive brushstrokes.
Somewhat disheveled, his eyes bleary from drink,King Ahasuerusleans heavily on his left forearm, spilling wine onto his lap from the goblet he holds. This painting shows a scene from the biblical Book ofEsther, when, after seven days of feasting and drinking, King Ahasuerus drunkenly asks one of hiseunuchsto summon the beautifulQueen Vashti. She refuses to appear, angering Ahasuerus and prompting him to dismiss her and choose Esther as his wife.Aert de Gelder places the characters against a neutralbackgroundand minimizes the action so that the focus is on the interaction between the two figures. Light falls from the left, highlighting the King's flushed face, extravagant clothing, and large frame. The dimly lit figure of the eunuch, modestly dressed, small in stature, and desexed, contrasts with the king's excessive appetites.
The severed head ofMedusastares out from the convex face of a two-sidedrelief. Its psychologicalrealism, simultaneously beautiful and hideous, reveals the conflicting yet symbiotic emotions of attraction and repulsion. This combination expresses the power of ancient Greek apotropaic objects, charms that warded off evil. Since the sight of Medusa's face--transformed by the goddessAthenainto a monster with snakes for hair--had turned men into stone, it became a traditional apotropaic symbol. Athena affixed the actual Medusa's monstrous head to her shield, and human warriors followed suit.The sculptor Vincenzo Gemito derived hiscompositionfrom the famousantiquecameo, theTazza Farnese,but transformed it into an entirely new kind of sculptural object. He revivedRenaissancetechniques of lost-wax casting to make the relief. Although he concentrated on the face of the two-sided, glistening metallic relief, he textured the back with snakeskin.
These  egg vases  are of exceptional quality: basketwork bases support egg-shaped bodies and bundles of straw form the handles, while small eggs resting in straw nests serve as the finials for each lid. Each vase is decorated with inlaid decoration: the blue ground color, known asbleu Fallot,was scraped away before firing to allow for thegrisaillereserves and for the area in which the supportingputtiwere to be painted. The porcelain painter Jean-Baptiste-Etienne Genest frequently used this technique; for this reason, the decoration is attributed to him.The painted reserves, which imitate carved stonereliefs, show mythological scenes of sacrifices on one side and trophies containing shields, arrows, and an axe on the other.
Girolamo Genga created a lively assortment of figure types, drawn in a rapid, energetic fashion. Rearing horsemen with their arms thrown back above their heads compete with men on foot carrying shields. Other groups contain pairs of soldiers locked in combat, wrestling each other on the ground or on foot. The artist used a delicate pattern of hatched lines in the background, adding texture and a sense of depth to the figures in front. Along the bottom edge Genga placed the design for a frieze, filled with sea gods riding an assortment of sea monsters.Scholars propose that this drawing may reflect Genga's early ideas for a battle scene. The Duke of Urbino commissioned him to paint such a scene for the Villa Imperiale in Pesaro.
The Russian ballerina Anna Pavlowa (or Pavlova) so greatly admired Arnold Genthe's work that she made the unusual decision to visit his studio, rather than have him come to her rehearsals. The resulting portrait of the prolific dancer, leaping in mid-air, is the only photograph to capture Pavlowa in free movement. Genthe regarded this print as one of the best dance photographs he ever made.
Several subjects coexist in this painting: theMadonna of Humility, theNativity, and theAnnunciationto the Shepherds. As the Madonna of Humility, the Virgin sits upon the ground, her hands folded in worship. Presenting the Nativity, a sleepingSaint Josephis shown at the left and an ox and donkey can be seen in the stable at the right. In the distance, a night landscape depicts shepherds receiving word of Christ's birth. Gentile da Fabriano's Madonna has a monumental grandeur, but thenaturalismof this depiction makes it more innovative than the more decorative versions he had painted before. Here, Gentile reduced the amount ofgold leafin thebackgroundand included a wider vista behind her, conveying a greater sense of depth.
Gently,Christplaces the ornate gold crown upon the Virgin Mary's slightly bowed head. Groups of musical angels watch from either side as she becomes theQueen of Heaven. Gentile da Fabriano used extensivetooling, decorative patterning,gold leaf, and richpigmentsto create a sumptuous surface resembling tapestry. The complex patterning, elaborate materials, and long flowing lines of the robes of the Madonna and Christ characterize theInternational Gothicstyle.Gentile was commissioned to paint this scene for his native town, Fabriano, when he was at the height of his fame. The gold-encrusted panel functioned as a processional standard held aloft in parades that honored theVirgin Mary. The panel originally depictedThe Stigmatization ofSaint Francison the reverse. Sometime prior to 1827, the panel was sawed into two sections; theSaint Francispanel is now in a private collection in Italy.
From the safety of the cave where they have taken refuge, Lot's daughters gaze toward God's annihilation of the city of Sodom, an event taking place outside the painting's borders. Strong light rakes across the three figures, gracefully posed to reflect their pensive emotional states.Believing that they alone survive to perpetuate the human race, the daughters have plied their father with liquor, as the empty silver flask and golden cup at left make clear. Unbeknownst to Lot, each daughter will mate with him and bear him a son, Moab and Ammon, the founders of tribes often pitted against Israel. This subject was popular in the 1600s not only for its inherent irony but also for the dramatic contrast between the heightened senses of the daughters and the inebriated state of their father. The biblical theme also provided a righteous pretext for alluding to a titillating taboo.
The crossed L's in each corner, the three fleurs-de-lis at the top surrounded by the arms of Saint Michael and Saint Esprit (Hope), and the attributes of war on either side are all symbols that help identify the painting that this frame once surrounded. As these are the royalemblemsof France, a portrait of the French monarch was once framed here, while the style of the frame suggests that it was carved during the reign ofLouis XV. Pictures of the king and his family were often given as presents, and such a lavish frame would have been prominently displayed in a public reception room.A plate of old mirror glass now replaces the lost painting.
Impatient to hear the oracle's message, Psyche and her mother enter the temple at the moment when the oracle reveals the beautiful girl's fate: she will marry a heartless monster. The oracle points a finger at Psyche, who collapses into the arms of her mother while her father andCupidwatch.The severity of the design emphasizes the drama's tragic atmosphere. Reflecting the influence of his mentor Jacques-Louis David, Franois Grard explicitly divided his composition between male and female protagonists, contrasting the women's emotionalism with Psyche's father's frowning severity and restraint.At the ParisSalonof 1796, Grard exhibited five drawings made as models for engraved illustrations of Jean de la Fontaine's poem,Les amours de Psych et de Cupidon(The Loves of Psyche and Cupid). The Getty Museum's drawing, rediscovered in the 1990s, is the only one among the original five known today.
Along a winding dirt path, the blind Belisarius carries his young guide. The boy has been bitten by a snake, which remains coiled around his bleeding leg. With his right arm wrapped limply around Belisarius's neck and his eyes closed, the youth balances precariously between life and death. Belisarius's eyes are also closed, but guided by his stick he moves forward with determination and purpose. He rises heroically against the spectacular sunset, a monumental figure creating a powerful outline against the sky. But the flaring sunset also signals a chill night and the uncertainty of the path ahead.Belisarius was a popular Byzantine general of the Roman Empire whose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In 1767, a novel by Jean-Franois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for artists--including Jacques-Louis David (Franois Grard's teacher), Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Jean-Baptiste Stouf (whose sculptureBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).For this painting, Grard both drew and departed from Marmontel's retelling of Belisarius's life. The general's young companion is present in Marmontel's novel. But to stress the bravery and pathos of the subject, Grard introduced the incapacitating snakebite. While Belisarius was typically depicted in the act of begging, Grard shows him standing and erect, his muscular form in sharp contrast to his guide's weakening body. The prominent helmet hanging from Belisarius's belt emphasizes the general's heroic past and underscores the injustice of his fall from favor.
Thodore Gricault carried this little book around in his pocket for more than two years, from 1812 to 1814. He used it to make rapid sketches from life and to copymotifsfromOld Masterpaintings and ancient sculpture, as well as to note ideas for future projects. The sketchbook clearly illustrates his broad range of interests, though it focuses on subjects such as horses and lions, which interested Gricault throughout his career.After Gricault's early death at the age of thirty-two in 1824, the contents of his studio, including thirty-three sketchbooks, were sold at auction. Most of these sketchbooks were later taken apart, and their individual pages have scattered among various private and public collections. Only six remain intact today. The Getty Museum's sketchbook is nearly complete, with a few detached single sheets showing that a few pages were cut or torn out at some point.
Thodore Gricault lightly drew the face of a man with a long, bushy mustache in one corner inside the front cover of his sketchbook.
The top third of the sheet has been torn away, leaving the hindquarters of two horses. Thodore Gricault suggested the musculature of legs and hooves with a swift series of triangles, circles, and zigzagging lines.
With a succession of smooth curving strokes that suggest rather than define the forms, Thodore Gricault formed the swiftly drawn hindquarters of two horses and a left foreleg.
One of several sketches of horses' hindquarters, this work exemplifies Thodore Gricault's fascination with the horse. The delicately drawn form on the left contrasts sharply with the simple outline on the right.
In addition to making another sketch of a horse's hindquarters, Thodore Gricault practiced drawing several studies of the braiding down the front of an officer's jacket, perhaps for his paintingCharging Chasseur.
In addition to the various sketches of a figure seated back-to-front on a chair, two tassels, and possibly a chair, a quick sketch in the corner of this sheet fascinates scholars today. Thodore Gricault turned his sketchbook upside down to draw an early version of his first important painting,Charging Chasseur.He brashly presented the final copy at the venerable ParisSalonin 1812, when he was only twenty-one years old.In both the sketch and the final work in theMuse du Louvre, an officer turns to look behind him as his horse rears and tries to flee. Gricault is said to have drawn his inspiration for the scene from seeing a carriage horse bolt on the outskirts of Paris. Still an inexperienced draftsman, he found the scene difficult and experimented numerous times, in pencil and in oils, before arriving at the finalcomposition.
In his sketchbook, Thodore Gricault drafted a letter to the powerful director of theMuse du Louvreand head of admissions to theSalon, Baron Dominique Vivant-Denon, asking him to hang Gricault's painting in the  best possible place. 
A letter from Thodore Gricault to Baron Dominique Vivant-Denon, director of theLouvreand head of admissions to theSalon, continues from the previous page.
Mainly self-taught, Thodore Gricault spent hours before theOld Masterpaintings in museums. He copied this standing cavalier from Anthony Van Dyck's portrait of KingCharles Iof England.
In this quick sketch of a horse's head, Thodore Gricault suggested the flowing mane, flared nostrils, and soft muzzle with a few strokes, without lingering over details.
In Thodore Gricault's swiftly penciled scene of a cavalry skirmish, the bodies of both horses and riders dissolve into a succession of curves.
Thodore Gricault developed the bodies, legs, and arms of both horses and riders with a swift series of circles and spirals. He simplified and compressed every feature down to its essentials.
Thodore Gricault made his numerous studies of horses at the imperial stables atVersailles, where he went almost daily to try to capture the form and movement of these animals.
In this rapidly drawn sketch of a man carrying another figure with a child by his side, Thodore Gricault concentrated on each body's simple contours, eliminating any unnecessary details.
One of his friends emphasized that Thodore Gricault  was a painter of the first thing that came along. . . . He did this to discover unexpected beauties.  Here he captured the power and energy of a rearing horse held by its trainer.
Thodore Gricault did not record his favorite horses only in dramatic moments. Here he sketched a horse trotting along, as well as several studies of a rearing animal.
Thodore Gricault frequently used his sketchbook to jot down ideas for future projects or to make rapid sketches from life. He experimented with these three arrangements for a group of figures.
Though small in scale, these four penciled sketches for groups of figures possess great power and vigor. Each scene seems full of lively action as bodies twist and turn.
In these two studies, Thodore Gricault easily captured the blurred movement and energy of a rearing horse. One horse seems to be caught in the act of twisting his head, while the other paws the air with his hooves.
Carrying his sketchbook with him on a walk in the country on a sunny day, Thodore Gricault captured this row of trees with their shadows.
Zigzagging lines and curving strokes capture the movement of shadow on the clouds above the treetops.
Thodore Gricault took his sketchbook to the country to sketch the facade of this country house set within its large garden. Loosely sketched trees and foliage hide the house from view.
Thodore Gricault inverted his sketchbook to draw this stag seated on the ground.
Thodore Gricault first lightly sketched the figure of the cavalier in his tall boots before turning the sketchbook ninety degrees to draw two men with bows and arrows on top.
Thodore Gricault executed the fine pencil strokes that form the body of the seated stag with a studied elegance, making the drawing appear effortless.
Thodore Gricault's numerous sketches of lions in this book show his fascination with the strength and beauty of these animals. Using swift strokes and lines that merely suggest but do not linger over specific details, he captured their muscular bodies, long, flowing manes, and broad paws.Gricault copied these animals from Peter Paul Rubens' paintingMarriage of Henri IV and Marie de'Mediciin theMuse du Louvre. In the picture, one of a cycle of twenty-seven monumental canvases painted to decorate a room in the Palais du Luxembourg, nudeputtiride the animals that pull the king and queen's chariot.
Occasionally, as Thodore Gricault traced the contours of a form, his pencil broke away from the overall shape into turbulent flutters. Here the graphite captures traces of his sudden excitement as he drew the lion's shaggy mane and coat.
After viewing several paintings created by artist Peter Paul Rubens in the 1600s, Thodore Gricault became fascinated with the subject of lions attacking horsemen.
Thodore Gricault turned his sketchbook horizontally to draw the dramatic scene of a lion attacking a horseman over the body of a fallen horse. He then inverted the book and sketched fourclassicalinteriors.
Thodore Gricault frequently used his sketchbook to jot down early ideas for future projects. He probably intended this battle sequence, and the other similar ones in this book, as the basis for a much largercomposition.
Though small in scale, both the figures and horsemen in this scene possess great energy and vigor: swords sweep through the air, horses rear in terror, and men limp away in agony.
With a simple delight, Thodore Gricault captured even the most mundane activity of the horse in his sketchbook. Here, a horse stands covered with a checkered blanket, just after being exercised.
Turning his sketchbook upright, Thodore Gricault sketched a man fallen from his horse at the top of the page. He drew the spotted hind legs of the horse with his book placed horizontally.
The figures of these three naked spear-holders relate to similar sketches scattered throughout the pages of Thodore Gricault's remaining intact sketchbooks. They could represent ideas for future projects, or they might bemotifscopied from paintings by other artists.
After copying two lions from a painting by Peter Paul Rubens, Thodore Gricault became fascinated with these animals. He lightly sketched the head and back legs of a lion on this sheet
During the more than two years it took him to fill this sketchbook, Thodore Gricault demonstrated his continued interest in lions by making numerous sketches of these animals.
Sketching swiftly to capture his live model while he rested,  Thodore Gricault suggested the lion's muscular strength, bushy mane, and large paws with a succession of curving strokes and zigzagging lines.
Dark, wavy strokes form the lion's shaggy mane, piercing eyes, and alert ears. The rest of his body is merely suggested with pale lines that break away from the form in turbulent flutters.
With nervous and expressive lines, Thodore Gricault sketched not only the overall form of the lion but also its head and hairy paws.
Using quick, assured strokes, Thodore Gricault merely suggested the shaggy profile of two lions lying with their front paws outstretched. He developed their muscular paws and bushy manes in a swift series of jagged lines and circles.
Peter Paul Rubens's paintings of lions in the 1600s inspired Thodore Gricault's many sketches of similar subjects two hundred years later.
Thodore Gricault simplified and compressed the features of this outstretched lion. Dark zigzagging lines and parallel hatching form its shaggy coat.
Thodore Gricault used his sketchbook to record specific details. Here he drew three light studies of a lion's head, two with mouths open in a roar and one with its body seen from slightly above.
Thodore Gricault crammed numerous different ideas onto this page. With his book lying horizontally, he sketched the hindquarters of a lion, its head in profile, and a scene of a man lifting another figure. Turning the sheet upright, he drew twocaricaturesof an elderly man.
Several quick sketches of lions fill this page as Thodore Gricault began some forms, then abandoned them to start others. Consequently, several of the drawings overlap.
The drawings in his sketchbooks show that Thodore Gricault had to laboriously develop and practice his ideas in order to later produce paintings that seemed easy and assured. Here he practiced drawing a lion's head and reclining body.
With a flurry of light pencil strokes, a lion strides across the sheet. Thodore Gricault then turned the page upside down and partly superimposed the head of another lion in the corner. Several dark strands suggest his long mane, upright ears, and furrowed brow.
Thodore Gricault's genius lay in his ability to suggest the contours of a form while simplifying and excluding unnecessary details. With a few essential strokes, he suggested the great energy and power of these lions.
Using both heavy and lighter strokes, Thodore Gricault sketched lions in various attitudes: a slight sketch of a head, one resting with its head on its paws, a head asleep, and one standing with its mouth open to roar.
Thodore Gricault experimented with the positions of two figures. On the left, a nude man raises his left leg and stretches out his arms. In the center, a woman in a tight-fitting dress leans to the right.
Sketches of men in battle appear throughout this and other sketchbooks by Thodore Gricault. As he used these notebooks to work out new ideas, he might have intended this sketch as an idea for a future project.
On the left side of the sheet, the curling body of a serpent imitates the waving strands of the lion's mane. These animals partly obscure the figure of a man supporting his body against a wall.
Thodore Gricault sketched a variety of hunting-related objects on this page, including a rifle, a rifle-butt, a pair of breeches, a holster with pistols, a falcon's head, and a stirrup. In the corner, he added a scene copied from a lithograph by the French artist Carle Vernet.
In the upper left corner of the sheet, Thodore Gricault noted the colors to be used on the spotted horse and its rider. He drew the horse in the bottom right with nervous but expressive lines.
Thodore Gricault divided this sheet into four sections that he then filled with various scenes, one of which is drawn over the head of a horse. One contains nude men fighting, another a man on a rock, and another a lion hunt.
Scholars believe that the man in military uniform riding a rearing horse is probably Czar Alexander I, since this image relates to Thodore Gricault's other drawings of that subject.
Thodore Gricault frequently knew the particular horses he drew. He made an effort to capture the individual character of each animal, rather than drawing only its type or breed.
Thodore Gricault posed the soldier in this slight drawing in a manner similar to the man in his 1814 paintingThe Wounded Cuirassier.He conceived the picture as apendantto his earlier work, theCharging Chasseur,and exhibited it in the ParisSalonthe same year. Gricault seems to have written the notes at the top of the cover to remind himself to copy variousmotifsand subjects from other masters and fromantiquity. For example, he noted works by his teacher Pierre-Narcisse Gurin, theFlemishartist Peter Paul Rubens, and the French artist Nicolas Poussin as important sources of inspiration.
Thodore Gricault relied only on broad outlines and richly appliedwashesto produce the muscular bodies of these two nudes. He reused a sheet covered with pencil drawings, creating new, more powerful forms that contrast linearity with volume. He may have sketched them at thecole des Beaux-Artsin Paris, where he copied antique statues for practice.The figures on theversoare less inventive and more orderly, arranged in two neat rows. Using pen and ink to cover older pencil drawings of studies of heads, Gricault again copied antique statues, including several inclassicalarmor as well as the figures ofCupidand Psyche. Most of these figures are simple outlines, while others have a delicately appliedwash.
An enthusiastic horseman himself, Thodore Gricault was fascinated with the movement and power of these animals. In this page from one of his many dismantled sketchbooks, both therectoandversocontain numerous drawings of horses. On the front or recto, Gricault experimented with placing different liveried officers on the backs of rearing horses. Although he varied the uniform, helmets, and swords of the officers, the prancing animals set at various angles appear to have the most energy. Gricault's animated pencil moved vigorously across the sheet, creating flowing tails and prancing feet with quick, sure strokes.On the back or verso, Gricault concentrated on bold renderings of horses alone. He practiced on four heads in the corner, while the central figures focus more on stance. The swirling lines that effortlessly suggest the head and manes of the animals blend into strong, muscular bodies with the addition of shaded lines. These quick sketches contrast sharply with the painstaking detail of a single hoof, where Gricault showed the nail studs of the horseshoe, the hairy fetlock, and strong bone structure with careful precision.
As a boy, Thodore Gricault loved drawing horses and would sit in the stables watching and drawing. In 1817, he traveled to Rome where he witnessed the annual Carnival horse race and subsequently made numerous studies of this spectacle. This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.A groom tries to contain a rearing horse in the center, while other men all around push and pull the wild animals, goading them into a frenzied stampede. Gricault used virtually monochromatic colors applied in thick swirls to animate and suggest extreme physical strength. The dramatic use of light and shadow adds energy to the relieflike scene. Gricault mythologized the event: the muscular nude in the center recalls athletes of ancient Greece, and the thrusting horses bring to mind the Parthenonfriezedesigned by Phidias. Gricault intended to use this study for a grand painting to submit to theSalon, but he had to abandon that plan when he was called back to France on short notice.
Thodore Gricault's only known erotic painting, this small oil sketch depicts two lovers locked in a passionate embrace while their languid companion calmly watches from the left. The woman's nudity and relaxed pose evoke theclassicaltradition of representing repose after lovemaking, a tradition that is also evoked by the way her voluptuous figure complements the statue ofVenusabove. Encoiled in her lover's arms and with her legs provocatively exposed, the woman in white is an active participant in the amorous act rather than a passive object. With a modern directness, Gricault captured the intensity and energy of human sexuality in a manner very different from the idealizing conventions of his age.Gricault 's expressive handling of line and paint accords with the passionate energy of the subject matter. Despite the small size and sketchy nature of this painting, Gricault made it as an independent work of art, intended for close private viewing.
In this drawing, made during a trip to Le Havre to observe the motion of the waves, Thodore Gricault showed his love of action and the technique of animated brushwork he used to express it. He intensified the dramatic effect of the ship pitching in the waves by applying accents of whitegouachehighlighting to the tumultuous waves, the edges of the storm-tossed ship's sails and riggings, and bits of the cloudy sky.Gricault made this drawing around 1818, when he was working out the composition of his masterpiece,The Raft of theMedusa, by carefully studying and sketching ships and water conditions.
This portrait was made as a study for Thodore Gricault's most famous painting,The Raft of the Medusa, made in 1819 and now in the Louvre. In a clear case of ineptitude, the ship named Medusa foundered in the sea off the coast of Africa in 1816. A raft with 140 passengers drifted for thirteen days before being rescued; only fifteen people survived. In preparation for his disturbing and controversial painting of the incident, Gricault made many studies from life, like this one, to achieve a sense of realism and specificity.The sitter wears a shirt similar to those worn by the survivors of theMedusa. Gricault captured the man's character with great sympathy and spontaneity; his watery eyes do not focus on anything outside the canvas but appear to express an internal torment. Shades of brown, gray, and beige blend together to imitate his dark complexion. Dabs of white and beige paint are used to indicate reflective light in his eyes and on the tip of his nose, his bottom lip, and his chin.
His brow was bent, his eye was glazed;He raised his arm, and fiercely raised,And sternly shook his hand on highAs doubting to return or fly.Taken from English Romantic poet Lord Byron's work of 1813,The Giaour: A Turkish Tale,these verses inspired the French Romantic painter Thodore Gricault to make this well-known watercolor. The dramatic story of an Arab Christian living as an infidel within his Muslim homeland tapped the vogue for Orientalism, which stemmed in part from Napoleon's recent campaigns in Egypt and Syria. Gricault's choice of subject matter was also affected by his passion for horses, which he often represented with great sensitivity.On a visit to England in 1820, Gricault learned the British style of watercolor painting, which emphasized translucentwashesthat allowed the white of the paper to shine through. After faintly sketching thegiaouron theversoof this sheet, he used the translucency of the watercolor to render the Arabian stallion's shining coat and the dramatically lit sky and ground in this finished drawing. The lithograph made after the drawing less effectively expresses the Romantic sense of drama.
These large tureens were designed to serveoille,a rich stew of meat such as rabbit, venison, or boar; vegetables; and a mixture of aromatic herbs. Here the boar's head and legs reflect the tureens' usual contents. Seventy years after they were made, these tureens were still listed in an inventory with their elaborate lids, now lost, which were ornamented with artichokes, cauliflowers, birds, shells, and shrimp.A pen and ink drawing for silver pieces, attributed to Thomas Germain, shows a preliminary sketch for a similar, lidded tureen. Very similar tureens, without lids and filled with fruit, appear in a painting by Alexandre-Franois Desportes, dated 1733.The 1700s brought important changes in the way in which people dined. Dinner changed from being a stiffly formal occasion into a convivial meeting where the art of conversation reigned supreme. Silver objects like tureens, oil and vinegar frames, sauceboats, and large matching services of plates and dishes appeared on the table, enabling diners to help themselves rather than be served individually by servants. The tureen first appeared at the end of the 1600s, but it was not until the 1720s that its use became more widespread.
This pair of large tureens with stands probably formed part of a sumptuous silver table service. Designed to hold a rich stew of meat or fish and vegetables, the lids reflect their original contents, which, according to a contemporary,  perfectly imitated nature.  The small crabs, prawns, and crayfish were cast from wax molds of dead shellfish. The realism of such details appealed to patrons in the mid-1700s, some of whom were amateur scientists and collectors of natural curiosities.The stands and liners are engraved with the arms of the British aristocrat Robert, first Lord Carrington. The arms were engraved in England late in the 1700s, effacing the heraldry of their original owner, a Portuguese archbishop. The cross of the Portuguese Order of Christ and the tassels of the archbishop's hat are still visible. They were left in place by an English silversmith who was probably unaware of their meaning.
These large tureens were designed to serveoille,a rich stew of meat such as rabbit, venison, or boar; vegetables; and a mixture of aromatic herbs. Here the boar's head and legs reflect the tureens' usual contents. Seventy years after they were made, these tureens were still listed in an inventory with their elaborate lids, now lost, which were ornamented with artichokes, cauliflowers, birds, shells, and shrimp.A pen and ink drawing for silver pieces, attributed to Thomas Germain, shows a preliminary sketch for a similar, lidded tureen. Very similar tureens, without lids and filled with fruit, appear in a painting by Alexandre-Franois Desportes, dated 1733.The 1700s brought important changes in the way in which people dined. Dinner changed from being a stiffly formal occasion into a convivial meeting where the art of conversation reigned supreme. Silver objects like tureens, oil and vinegar frames, sauceboats, and large matching services of plates and dishes appeared on the table, enabling diners to help themselves rather than be served individually by servants. The tureen first appeared at the end of the 1600s, but it was not until the 1720s that its use became more widespread.
This small tray once carried two lidded pots for cosmetics, which would have sat on the two circular spaces in the design. The tray probably formed part of a larger toilet service consisting of a matching mirror, brushes, combs, and assorted pots and boxes for makeup and jewelry. The center of the tray displays the engraved arms of the marquis de Menars.The toilet service was first developed at the end of the 1600s in France, where it was often given as a wedding present to the bride from her new husband. The range of boxes and containers, sometimes consisting of more than thirty pieces, was arranged on her dressing table, creating an impressive display when she received guests in her bedroom, as was the custom of the day.
This unusual silver sculpture represents two birds, a rabbit, and a variety of vegetables. Lying on its side, the small rabbit is flanked by the game birds: an ortolan and a snipe with a long beak. A cauliflower with raggedly trimmed stalk and leaves rises above the animals. The still life also includes an onion, a turnip, a gherkin, a truffle, and a morel mushroom. Leafy plants peek out at the edges of a rocky ground evoking the earthen floor of a wood or glade.The termMachine d'Argent(literally,  silver machine ) was first assigned to this sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, who acted as intermediary between Franois-Thomas Germain and thepatron, Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg. In the 1700s, the wordmachinesignified an artistic innovation as well as a mechanicaldevice. Germain was specifically commissioned to create a decorative centerpiece to complement a series of paintings owned by the Duke that depicted exotic animals and scenes of the hunt. The sculpted game birds and rabbit represent trophies of the hunt. Combined with the root vegetables and mushrooms, the animals also alluded to the ingredients of a rich stew.Using a secret casting technique,Machine d'Argenttook seven months to create. Germain cast some of the still life elements from molds of dead animals or vegetables. These individual elements were then assembled together on the base. The rich variety of detail showcased Germain's ability to transform silver into the diverse textures of nature: from the soft fur of the rabbit and downy feathers of the ortolan to the multi-beaded head of cauliflower and the smooth, waxy skin of the onion bulb.
Modeled in the form of three laurel branches tied with a ribbon, these massive wall lights with their detailed chasing and burnishing reveal the extraordinary skill of their maker, a silversmith to Louis XV, king of France. Each wall light is slightly different from the others.These four wall lights are among eight made in 1756 for the newly redecorated interiors of the famous Parisian palace, the Palais-Royal, which was the residence of the king's cousin, Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orlans. Shortly after inheriting the building in 1752, he commissioned the architect Pierre Contant d'Ivry to renovate the main rooms. Engravings of these rooms, showing the wall lights in place, were reproduced in Diderot'sEncyclopdie,one of the principal works of the Age of Enlightenment. An inscription on the Getty Museum's drawing for one of these wall lights explains that it should hang above the fireplace.
At the apex of this theatrically arranged study,Augustus Caesarsits in front of the Temple of Janus and touches the shoulder of a manpersonifyingRome. Surrounding him are scholars and statesmen while foreign tribes gather below. TheNativityscene in theforegroundillustrates the coincidental moment of world peace under Augustus whenChristwas born.In 1852, Jean-Lon Grme received a state commission to paint a large mural of anallegoricalsubject of his choosing. In selecting this subject, Grme perhaps sought to flatterEmperor Napoleon III, whose government commissioned the painting and who was identified as a  new Augustus. In preparation for his large mural, Grme traveled all over to find the appropriate ethnic types to portray the different peoples of the ancient world. WhenThe Age of Augustus, The Birth of Christwas shown in 1855 at the Universal Exposition, his skill in depicting various nationalities led some to remark that Grme gave a lesson whenever he painted a picture.
Grme made this keenly observed portrait of a fellah (peasant) from life, during the first of several visits he made to Egypt. The drawing served as a study for a painting (now lost) portraying Egyptian farm laborers at work. Later, Grme's pupil Charles Bargue included a lithograph after it in their influential teaching manual, Drawing Course (1866 - 1871).  The drawing depicted one of only two non-European subjects in the book. In contrast to the Romantic artists Gricault and Delacroix, Grme's approach seems dispassionate and documentary. Despite the apparent realism of his drawings, however, they are seldom objective records. Grme often used such  authentic  details to construct scenes that appealed to Western fantasies about the East.
 To showe to posteritie the manner of souldiers apparel used in these dayes.  So wrote Jacques de Gheyn of his goals for his lavishly illustrated bookThe Exercise of Arms,published in 1607. In this preparatory drawing for the book, de Gheyn strove to create the illusion of a living soldier, carefully modeled in the round and exhibiting a wealth of detail both in costume and weaponry. Focusing on the intricate task of lighting the fuse of his musket, the soldier wears a large plumed hat, billowing striped pantaloons, and high boots, with powder charges strung across his breast. De Gheyn used a simple but imposing pose to create interest, with long, diagonal lines created by the soldier's musket, his sword, and the intersecting angle of his musket rest.Conceived as a military handbook for the infantry,Exercise of Armscontained one hundred and seventeen designs illustrating the use of the smallshot, the musket, and the pike. Count Johann II of Nassau-Siegen commissioned the text to give the Dutch army a set of clear and systematic military procedures for training soldiers. In the final edition, each image also contained a description of the action shown and its associated commands.
An armored and an unarmored cavalryman lean against the frame of an empty cartouche that pliantly melts into grotesque strapwork. A witty arrangement of equestrian accouterments decorates the top and bottom, including a saddle laden with weapons, flags, stirrups, a curry comb, and other brushes. A laurel-crowned skull and smoking trumpets below symbolize death and fame. The guns and blades that extend up and down from the cartouche evoke the battle charge and give a three-dimensional depth to the scene.Jacques de Gheyn drew this elaborate frame as a model in reverse for the title page ofThe Exercise of Arms, published in 1607. Conceived as a military handbook for the cavalry regiments of the Dutch army,The Exercise of Armscontained twenty-two designs. Count Johann II of Nassau-Siegen commissioned the text to give the Dutch horse guards a set of clear and systematic military procedures for training soldiers.
The young man on the left gazes steadily outward, capturing the viewer's interest with his direct stare. His features seem more realistic, more like a portrait than the other, obviously imaginary figures, and his position squarely facing the viewer also isolates him. The care with which Jacques de Gheyn II rendered the boy's fanciful costume also contrasts with the other heads. Paying close attention to the fall of light, de Gheyn evoked the textures of the youth's clothing--especially the turban--with beautiful, varied penwork that demonstrates the creases and gathers. He built up the other heads using rather somewhat more regular cross-hatching.De Gheyn first sketched the three foreground figures of the young boy and two men, then later added the angel and the female head. He seems to have been one of the first artists to mingle figures drawn from nature with those from his imagination.  Scholars believe that these studies may have been cut from a larger sheet, with the triangular patch at the bottom added at that time.
At first glance, this drawing of a frog appears to be a closely observed study of the natural world. Jacques de Gheyn II meticulously recorded the amphibian's long hind legs and loose skin. But on closer inspection the frog was clearly imbued with human characteristics. Its webbed feet were transformed into claw-like hands and the exaggerated hump on its back evokes a grotesque old man. With its raised head and prominent eye, the frog even appears to hold an impassive, almost haughty expression. De Gheyn pushed the boundaries of the natural world further: the frog sits atop a pile of coins and with its left  hand  grasps a sphere about the same size as its twisted trunk.Somewhere between a realistic rendering of nature and an imaginative fantasy, the frog is an allegory of avarice. The creature does not merely rest on the coins but reaches greedily and uncouthly between its legs to grasp at them. The large sphere may symbolize the earth and the frog all the world's greed. Appropriate to the sin of avarice, the humanized frog is itself a monstrous perversion of the natural world.Fascinated by nature, De Gheyn created a large number of allegorical and anatomical drawings of amphibians, mice and rats, horses and donkeys, and insects. This small study was probably part of a much larger sheet covered with other fantastical images. Collectors considered such sheets marvels of virtuosity and imaginative power.
Portraits like this led Jacques De Gheyn III's biographer to declare that he had a  predilection for elderly, wrinkled models.  De Gheyn III portrayed this unknown individual in profile, with his thin forelock, long nose, and full beard successively cascading down the left side of the drawing. Using a wide variety of thick and thin pen lines, dots, dashes, and calligraphic hatching, De Gheyn conveyed the textural effects of the sitter's hair and rough, aged skin. Though no certain connection has been found, historians have suggested that De Gheyn may have made this work in preparation for his seriesThe Seven Wise Men of Greece,published in 1616.
On the right side of this drawing, Serafino Falzacappa practices writing his name, while in the middle, his older brother Francesco grasps a hefty book in his small hands. The boys are not dressed for a formal portrait, and seem at ease in a comfortable environment, which lends a sense of immediacy to the drawing. Inkpots and quill pens stand ready for the boys' use. Pier Leone Ghezzi, more known today for his caricature drawings, recorded a scene from daily life in the 1700s that is as familiar and meaningful as any modern portrait of children. Ghezzi probably made this engaging scene in a quiet moment while visiting the Falzacappa family, who were his longtime patrons.
An unidentified nude female figure, is shown bathing in a gracefulserpentinepose, characteristic ofManneristelegance and known asfigura serpentinata. The elaborate pose encourages the viewer to examine the statue from all sides. Giambologna concentrated on the aesthetics of creating an upwardly spiraling movement rather than suggesting a narrative. He contrasted the elegant contours of her smooth, attenuated body and characteristically expressionless face with her intricately carved,classicizingcoiffure, drapery, and armband.X-rayanalysis has revealed a network of apparently interconnecting channels running from her raised left hand down to the base of the column upon which she sits, which suggests that the figure may once have served as a fountain.Marble works by Giambologna are very rare, but contemporary documents discuss a statue that scholars identify with this one. In 1568 the biographer Giorgio Vasari mentioned a statue of a nude woman that Giambologna made for Bernardo Vecchietti in Florence; another biographer reported that the work was later sent to the Duke of Bavaria.
The tabletop bronze of a lion attacking a horse exhibits a dramatic life and death struggle typical of the intense emotionalism of earlyBaroquesculpture. Both the bronze and itspendant,Lion Attacking a Bull,feature a wild beast, the ferocious lion, attacking a domesticated animal and forcing it to collapse. The artist delighted in the power of the animals, whose muscular contortions express their physical struggle and psychological anguish. InLion Attacking a Horse,the artist emphasized the brutality of the kill, using a circularcompositionto focus attention on the lion's claws tearing through the horse's hide. Animal subjects were extremely popular in the early 1600s and a genre for which the sculptor, Giambologna, was well known.Lion Attacking a Horseis based on a fragmentaryantiquestatue now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome. Many casts of theLion Attacking a Horseare extant; the Museum's bronze is among the highest in quality of those that survive.
As the lion sinks his teeth into the bull's side, the bull falls to his knees, straining his neck to reach his attacker. This sculpture is one of a pair of tabletop bronzes that show a wild beast brutally killing a domesticated animal. Although the pair are based onantiquemodels, the animal subject and intense emotionalism are characteristic of the late 1500s and early 1600s.In a play of space and movement, theManneristsculptor Giambologna arranged the figures' limbs in a circle. Although the piece has a principal frontal view, the animals yield a variety of different views as a spectator walks around the sculpture. The artist endowed the work with vivid details: the graphically rendered skin pulled by the lion's claws, the taut muscles of the bull's legs, and the longer hair on the top of the bull's head, carefully distinguished from the shorter fur around his flared nostrils.After Giambologna sculpted the model, Antonio and or Giovanni Francesco Susini's bronzefoundrycast the sculpture. In his biography of Giambologna, Filippo Baldinucci mentions the pair of animal bronzes, but they may have been cast after Giambologna's death as the Susini continued using his models for many years.
Under a high,coffereddome, numerous mythological figures prepare a monument in honor of the famous Italian sculptor Antonio Canova.Minerva, the goddess of Wisdom, leads Canova toward the cylindrical structure, while the winged figure of Fame, holding a trumpet, tries to crown him with a laurel wreath. In the center, Victory inscribes Canova's name on the monument for two of the most renowned sculptors of Greekantiquity, Phidias and Praxiteles. At the base of the monument, Time unveils Canova's sculptureTheseusand the Minotaur,while the figure of Truth leans against it with the light of knowledge on her breast. At the far right, Evil is overcome by the lion, theattributeofSaint Markand the symbol of Venice, where Canova lived.Felice Giani produced the drawing as apreparatory studyfor a monument, planned but never built, in honor of Canova. The sculpture was to commemorate the artist, who died in 1822.
Figures appear to stand on a stage, while a masked Harlequin, thecommedia dell'arte'sleading character, sits at a table and lures a fashionable young lady into prostitution. As the young woman holds the doctor's hand, a young man across the room stares with a displeased expression. Othercommedia dell'artecharacters, the merchant Pantaloon and Mezzetin in his floppy hat, lend Harlequin their support.Claude Gillot made this drawing as a design for an engraving in a book about one of his favorite subjects, thecommedia dell'arte, a popular entertainment born in Italy and later embraced by the French. In the book, Gabriel Huquier'sThtre italien, the scene is identified as  Arlequin grapignant,  or  Harlequin as Procurer. The drawing is characteristic ofcommedia dell'arte'stendency to satirize human folly and pretense. Gillot's dashing, shorthand penwork and the luminous red wash imbue the drawing with a lightheartedness that conveys the comical mood of action onstage.
Two brightly colored figural groups from the GinoriPorcelainfactory depict violent episodes from the Roman poetOvid'sMetamorphoses.Modeled in porcelain,Jupiter'smessengerMercuryattacks Argus on one pedestal, whilePerseuskillsMedusaon another. The factory reused Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze casting molds, replicating theBaroquesculptor's muscular figures, wind-blown dramatic draperies, and dynamiccompositions. Yet the painting, using jewel-like yellow, purple, blue, and pinkpigmentsandgilding, brings out a spirited delicacy more typical of theRococostyle of the mid-1700s. As a result, Medusa, whose horrifying look was reputed to turn men to stone, is merely a rather startlingly rosy-cheeked woman with snakes for hair, while Argus, the hundred-eyed giant who tormented Jupiter's lover Io, is a handsome, muscled warrior.Each figural group is made from ten separate sections, each of which was press-molded and fired before being joined together. The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum. The two lively groups would have been a dramatic centerpiece for a dinner-table setting.The group was painted in the shop of Johann Karl Wendelin Anreiter von Zirnfeld.
Magnanimity, or greatness of soul, is the moral virtue of bearing adversity with tranquility and equanimity. This female personification wears an imperial crown and a gold brocade cloak lined with royal ermine to indicate the nobility of her disposition.Two flying putti proffer another crown and a scepter, the symbol of Magnanimity's power to execute her noble thoughts, while the lion at her feet alludes to her fearlessness. At left, a putto prepares to empty a cornucopia (horn of plenty), evoking her generosity and disregard for material rewards and personal advantage.
This tiny, hand-heldmanuscriptwas the personalprayer bookof Andrea Gualengo and his wife, Orsina d'Este, who was a member of the ruling family of Ferrara, where this manuscript was made. A high-rankingcourtierat the Este court, Gualengo successfully negotiated an accord between the cities of Faenza and Ferrara. Probably in recognition of his diplomatic service, he was allowed to marry into the Este family. Thebook of hoursmay have been made in connection with Andrea and Orsina's wedding.The text of the manuscript comprises the standard readings found in books of hours, including theHours of the Virgin,Penitential Psalms, theHours of the Holy Cross, theOffice for the Dead, and Suffrages, which are prayers to saints. This last section contains the majority of the twenty-one full-pageminiaturesin the manuscript.Two artists working at the court of Ferrara painted the illuminations. Taddeo Crivelli was responsible for the majority of the miniatures, and another importantilluminator, Guglielmo Giraldi, contributed four of them. An example of theRenaissancestyle in northern Italy, the manuscript is rich in references toclassicalantiquity and employs a variety of dramatic illusionistic devices.
On this first page of the pre-dawn service ofMatinsfrom theHours of the Virgin, the Virgin and Child embrace within an initialD. The text, taken fromPsalm50,reads:Domine labia mea aperies et os meus an[n]utiabit laudem tuam(Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise).
An assembly of richly robed saints introduces prayers addressed to the congregation of all the saints. The group includesSaint Peterwith a book and the key to the Church,Saint Paulwith a book and a sword, and a virginmartyrwith a palm leaf, the symbol of victory over death.
Saint Catherine of Bolognawears the habit of thenunsof the Order of Saint Clare, theFranciscan orderfor women. She joined the order in Ferrara and later became abbess of the convent in Bologna. Saint Catherine, who died in 1463, was venerated locally soon after her death. She was not formally canonized until 1712.
Represented as a young nobleman, Saint Ossanus inspired a local cult following around the town of Ozzano, east of Bologna. Although he holds a martyr's palm, he was never officially recognized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church.
Pluto, represented as a mature man, attempts to abduct the nubile Proserpine, while a maid below struggles to assist her. The three nude figures join together with drapery in a spiral from which Proserpine gracefully extends her arms, reaching out and up in resistance. In contrast to the figures' animated gestures, their faces are relatively expressionless. Franois Girardon's large bronze of Pluto Abducting Proserpine represents the violent abduction of Zeus and Demeter's young daughter by the god of the underworld. This event explained the change of the seasons in Greek mythology: in response to Demeter's grief at the loss of her daughter, Zeus and Pluto agreed that Proserpine, who represented Spring, would spend six months of the year above ground with her mother and the remaining six underground with Pluto, thus causing winter.Louis XIV commissioned four monumental marble abduction groups to decorate the corners of Charles LeBrun's never-completed garden at Versailles, the Parterre d'Eau. This bronze is a version of Girardon's preparatory model for one of these statues. Each group of three figures symbolized one of the four elements: earth, air, wind, and fire. Pluto's association with hell made him an apt symbol of fire.
Pluto, god of the Underworld, seizes Proserpine, daughter of the agricultural goddess Ceres; one of her servants, fallen to the ground, tries unsuccessfully to stop him. According to Ovid'sMetamorphoses, Pluto was watching Proserpine pick flowers in a meadow when he was struck by one of Cupid's arrows. Pluto carried Proserpine down to his kingdom on a chariot drawn by black horses. According to Greek mythology, Pluto allowed Proserpine to return to earth each spring for four months, thus explaining the change of the seasons.This bronze is a copy after a larger preparatory model, also in the Museum's collection, by Louis XIV's preeminent sculptor, Franois Girardon. Louis XIV commissioned Girardon to create one of four monumental marble groups intended to decorate the corners of Charles Le Brun's never-completed garden at Versailles, the Parterre d'Eau. Each group of three figures symbolized one of the four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. Pluto's association with Hell made him an apt symbol of fire.
In 1842 Girault de Prangey traveled from his native France to Italy, Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, Turkey, Syria, and Palestine. His photographs of these ancient sites were fresh and innovative. By viewing the Temple of Vesta from an elevated perspective, he filled the plate from edge to edge, daringly excluding the foundation and one-third of the column shaft. No photographer before him had created as revealing a picture of a celebrated public monument. Only rediscovered in the 1920s, Girault de Prangey's daguerreotypes remained in the possession of a single family until a number of items were sold at auction in London in 2003.
I pride myself on the use that I made of the tool invented by Daguerre. I obtained, usually with complete success, variousbas-reliefsand statues at the Acropolis, many fragments, and whole monuments.-Joseph-Philibert Girault de PrangeyThedaguerreotypehas been called a  mirror with a memory -perhaps an especially apt description for this photograph of archaeological remains from the Acropolis. The headless, armless figure, believed to be the goddess of victory from the Temple ofAthenaNike, emerges ghostlike from the daguerreotype's polished surface. Surrounding spectralhighlights(white dots that were a typical result of the plate's uneven coating and development) seem to enhance the sense of time passage.This is one of the oldest surviving photographs ever made of the Acropolis, one of theNear Eastsites that Frenchman Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey traveled to in 1842 to study and document ancient architecture. In subject matter andcomposition, this image resembles those created by other daguerreotypists in the circle of Daguerre himself. Like those photographers, Girault de Prangey may have been inspired by the centuries-old tradition of artists making sketches afterold masterworks.
The Temple of Seti I is located at the archaeological site of Gournah in Egypt. By moving close to the subject, Girault de Prangey conveyed the gravity and drama of the huge decaying stones. No earlier photograph is known in which the visual elements of light and viewpoint are harnessed so skillfully to express essential aspects of an ancient Egyptian monument. Through his unique, prescient vision, Girault de Prangey created among the greatest achievements in the early history of photography.
Jerusalem's Probatic Pool was believed to be the site of a miracle performed by Jesus. According to the Bible, he healed a man who had been lame for thirty-eight years. By exploiting the strong sunlight and deep shadows, Girault de Prangey not only captured the essence of a minimalist subject in a way not possible with painting or drawing, but also enhanced its mystery. The Museum's collection of Girault de Prangey works is one of the largest held by an American institution.
Returning home, the beardedTheseusreaches out to greet his wife Phaedra, who shies away from his embrace. Surprised at this cold reception, Theseus looks inquiringly at his son Hippolytus. During his absence, Phaedra had fallen in love with her stepson, and she is now unable to meet Theseus's eyes. The dialogue underneath the picture recounts the verbal exchange. Phaedra says,  I am unworthy of pleasing you or being near you. I can henceforth only hide myself from you.  Theseus then turns to Hippolytus, asking,  What is this strange welcome you give your father   Hippolytus replies,  Only Phaedra can explain the mystery. Anne-Louis Girodet de Roucy-Trioson made this highly finished study as an illustration for a series of deluxe editions of the plays of Racine, a French dramatist from the 1600s. The publisher chose seven artists to illustrate the set, which was dedicated toNapoleon, and retained the original drawings, including this one, after the engravings were made.Girodet displayed such typicallyNeoclassicalcharacteristics as firm, linear drawing; carefully shaded three-dimensional forms; and a static, orderedcomposition. Appropriately, his monumental figures--especially the central figure of Theseus silhouetted in front of an open doorway--seem more like Greek statues than living actors.
 Whosoever had not known that this young maiden had once enjoyed the light of day would have taken her for a statue of virginity asleep,  wrote Franois Ren Chateaubriand of Atala in his popular Romantic novel of 1801. Taking inspiration from such poetic lines, the artist, painting in a style similar to Anne-Louis Girodet de Roucy Trioson, let the rays of the moon play upon Atala and cast over the whole a dreamlike, mystical, magic light, establishing a decidedly Romantic mood. In this scene, Atala's beloved American Indian lover--looking like aNeoclassicalversion of a Roman hero--and a missionary lay her to rest after she has committed suicide rather than break the vow of virginity she made to her dying mother.Burial of Atalafirst showed at the ParisSalonof 1808 and then exhibited it again in 1814, receiving acclaim both times. Other artists painted numerous copies--such as this one--shortly after its first exhibition, and it has since become a landmark in art-historical studies, exemplifying the transition from Neoclassicism toRomanticismin the early 1800s.
Aligned with the figure of the Virgin Mary, the dove of the Holy Spirit descends toward the apostles, who hold their hands folded together or outspread in a variety of positions of prayer. A sense of serenity and calm pervades this depiction of the Pentecost.Although only eight inches tall, this miniature has an impressive monumentality. The illuminator Girolamo da Cremona used the compositional and mathematical principles employed by fifteenth-century painters who worked on a larger scale. The miniature is symmetrically organized around the clear central axis of the Virgin and the dove: windows flank the dove, an equal number of apostles kneel in parallel rows, and candlesticks and books on the mantelpiece frame the Virgin. To relieve the monotony of the strict symmetry, the artist varied details such as the colors of the apostles' robes, the men's gestures, and the arrangement of books around the candles. Similarly, an open window opposes a closed one.The Pentecost miniature was made for a liturgical book or a book of private devotion. No other part of the manuscript has come to light.
Girolamo del Pacchia created a complex panorama to fill this long and narrow panel, whose dimensions reflect its original function as part of a marriage chest, or cassone, containing a bride's household linens. Inspired by Domenico Beccafumi, Girolamo employed delicate color and the traditional Sienese grace of line to beautify the violent subject. The intertwined limbs and intense emotion conveyed by exaggerated gestures reflectManneristideals, Girolamo added the rounded forms and drama of Raphael's Roman decorations.Artists often painted the rape of the Sabines, an important incident in the legendary history of Rome. After founding Rome, Romulus solved the problem of a lack of women by inviting the Sabines, an ancient Italian people, to a festival. During the celebrations, the young Romans drove away the men and carried off the women.
This softly rendered view of marshy ponds by Andr Giroux owes much of its character to Giroux's training as a painter. Seeking to obliterate any evidence of photography's mechanical nature, he achieved the photograph's softened edges and atmospheric haziness by drawing and scratching on the negative. This technique is a variation ofclich-verre(literally,  glass negative ), a method of painting onto a transparent support and using it to print a positive image. Instead of starting with a blank piece of glass, Giroux worked directly on the photographic negative. He created a Romantic, idyllic landscape in the tradition of the Barbizon school of landscape painting.
Capitalizing on the popularity of calling cards in the mid-1800s, the French photographer A.A.E. Disdri seized upon the idea of pasting photographs to small cards. Cheap to produce, the carte-de-visite instantly became a popular form of portraiture during the 1850s and 60s. Images of celebrities and performers were in high demand and it was not unusual for a collector to assemble a group of such cards in one large album. Among the various dancers shown here is the noted ballerina Marie Petipa.
The publisher ofVogue, Vanity Fair, House and Garden,andGlamourmagazines was discerning, shrewd, unremitting in his search for stylistic perfection, and--as his portrait shows--unbending. His magazines, the first to use photographs instead of drawings for editorial purposes, steadily commissioned work from distinguished photographers including Baron Adolphe de Meyer, Edward Steichen, Cecil Beaton, Horst P. Horst, and George Hoyningen-Huene. Here the Carolyn and Edwin Gledhill portrayed Cond Nast at the height of his success as a publisher and party giver.
Studies made by two Dutch artists during an exploratory expedition to Brazil from 1637 to 1644 were the inspiration for this tapestry. The newly appointed Dutch governor, Prince Johan Maurits of Nassau, led a group of scientists and artists, including Albert Eckhout and Frans Post, to Brazil, where they studied and painted the unusual plant and animal life of this country. Many of the plants, fish, birds, and other animals woven in this hanging can be traced to life studies made by Eckhout and Post in South America. French artists at the Gobelins manufactory, who designed thecartoonto heighten the tapestry's impression of drama and exoticism, probably introduced other animals, such as the Indian rhinoceros and  striped horse  or zebra.
This is one of a series of twelve tapestries, which each showed an astrological sign for a month with a French royal palace in thebackground. The month of December shows the Chteau of Monceaux (demolished in 1799, during theFrench Revolution) through the bare trees. On the left,Louis XIVleads a hunting party with horsemen and hounds after a wild boar. In the center of the top border, the astrological sign of Capricorn hangs between garlands of winter fruit and vegetables. In theforeground, two liveried pages drape a rareNear Easterncarpet over thebalustrade, while a moorhen, crane, and bustard, birds from the royal menagerie, strut along the front.
The French kingLouis XVpresented Germain-Louis Chauvelin, his Keeper of Seals, with this tapestry, originally one of a set of ten. Known as aportire, it would have hung across the door of a formal room to keep out drafts. Its prominent heraldic symbols would have clearly announced to visitors the importance of its owner and royal donor. Displayed under a gilded and tasseled canopy, the royalcoat of armsappears against an ermine-lined mantle. The arms rest upon a gilt metal box decorated with fleur-de-lis and L's, the king's initial, representing the casket for the royal seals. The tapestry's wide border contains crossed maces, attributes of the keeper of seals; Chauvelin's monogram of interlaced C's; and his coat of arms in the four corners.Around 1680,Louis XIVbegan a tradition of presenting his chancellor or his keeper of seals with a set of tapestries from the Gobelins tapestry manufactory. A powerful figure in the 1600s and 1700s, the keeper of seals acted as minister of justice and was second in command to the chancellor of France. The chancellor represented the person of the king, interpreted the royal will, and headed the judicial system. Chauvelin accepted the tapestry set around 1730, at the height of his career.
The arms ofLouis XV, who came to the throne as a five-year-old in 1715, announce this tapestry's royal origin and purpose. Under the head ofApollo, from whom the sun's rays emanate, a large crown tops a simulated bronze cartouche. Within the cartouche, the three fleurs-de-lis symbolize the arms of France, hanging in the center of an ermine cloak flanked by two military trophies. Suspended medals hang below, in front of the crossed scepter and the  hand of justice,  symbolizing the king's legal power. A royal ceremonial helmet at the bottom seems to rest upon another military trophy. The tapestry's color and design were new, but its celebratory purpose and the specific imagery harked back to the symbols ofLouis XIVfrom the previous reign.The Gobelins tapestry manufactory wove twenty-eight examples of this tapestry over a period of about fifteen years. One of theseportiresdecorated the door of a salon atVersailles, others hung in several of the royal chteaux, and French ambassadors used several to decorate their embassies.
In an episode from the highly popular romance by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ofThe Story ofDon Quixoteseries, the tapestry designer copied the painter Charles-Antoine Coypel's image of Sancho, the companion of Don Quixote, in a palatial setting. Agiltchandelier fitted with burning candles hangs above, and a buffet set with ceremonial silver stands against the back wall. To the right, the bearded and bespectacled figure of the doctor points to the table with a long stick. On his orders, the pages bring various dishes and then whisk them away as he declares their contents detrimental to Sancho's health.Around the central scene, the tapestry also features an elaborate surrounding decoration known as thealentours.Amid the garlands of flowers and fruit, two hanging bronzemedallionscontain profiles of knights. Two monkeys also play in the long garlands on the right and left. The monkey on the right dangles a long lance in the direction of the three sheep below, who scatter. In the opposite corner amid a pile of books, a spotted spaniel points at the other monkey above. The title tapestry's title is woven in yellow thread in the bottom center.This tapestry was woven at Gobelins under the direction of Michel Audran and his son Jean Audran fils. Thealentourswere designed by Claude Audran III, Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay fils, Alexandre-Franois Desportes, and Valande.
The story ofDon Quixote, based on the highly popular romance novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, served as the basis for one of the Gobelins manufactory's most popular sets of tapestries, woven in nine separate series throughout the 1700s. Although the central scenes showing the escapades of Don Quixote and his companion Sancho remained the same, the surrounding decoration, known as thealentours,changed to reflect current fashions. The Getty Museum's tapestries come from the eighth weaving, which used the newly invented rose- and crimson-colored ground.The French kings often gave tapestries as diplomatic gifts. On August 20, 1786,Louis XVIpresented the Museum's tapestries to his sister-in-law, the duchess of Saxe-Teschen, and her husband the duke, the governors of the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). Unlike many surviving hangings from the 1700s, these four tapestries remain in superb condition. The colors of all four scenes have faded very little overall, and some colors are still strong, particularly the shades of purple in thealentours,which usually fade to gray upon exposure to light.The surrounds for these tapestries were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Franois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques. The tapestries were woven in Michel Audran's workshop, assisted by his son, Jean Audran, fils.
In an episode fromThe Story ofDon Quixote,based on the enormously popular romance novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Sancho, Don Quixote's companion, ceremoniously arrives on the island of Barataria and is carried along the paved street amid a group of citizens.All four tapestries from the Getty Museum's Don Quixote series feature a surrounding decoration known as thealentours.This elaborate frame represents a damask wall covering festooned with thick garlands of fruit and flowers. The picture frame rests on a base piled with armor, an axe, flags, and twocornucopiaspilling fruit. At the bottom the tapestry's title is woven in yellow thread.This tapestry was woven at Gobelins under the direction of Michel Audran and his son Jean Audran fils. Thealentourswere designed by Claude Audran III, Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay fils, Alexandre-Franois Desportes, and Valande.
In an episode from the story ofDon Quixote, based on the enormously popular romance novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, the armored knight Don Quixote leads a hunt for wild boar while his terrified companion, Sancho, climbs a tree trunk to the left.All four of the Getty Museum's Don Quixote tapestries feature a surrounding decoration known as thealentours.This elaborate frame represents a damask wall covering festooned with thick garlands of fruit and flowers.

The tapestry designer based his depiction of an episode from Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's enormously popular romance,The Story ofDon Quixote,on a painting by Charles-Antoine Coypel. He placed Don Quixote and his companion Sancho in a room furnished with a bed and two chairs. Don Quixote sleeps in one of the chairs, dreaming ofMinerva, goddess of wisdom, who approaches in a cloud with her left arm extended to dispel his madness. Sancho, standing next to his master, gazes in a trance at the figure of Folly, who carries in her right hand a model of a castle and in her left a pole with a fool's cap.Around the central scene, the tapestry also features an elaborate surrounding decoration known as thealentours.Amid the garlands of flowers and fruit, a monkey plays on each side. The monkey on the right dangles a long lance in the direction of the three sheep below, who scatter. In the opposite corner amid a pile of books, a spotted spaniel points at the other monkey above. The tapestry's title is woven in yellow thread in the bottom center.The surrounds for this tapestry were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Franois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques. It was woven in Michel Audran's workshop, assisted by his son, Jean Audran, fils.
This tapestry contains two scenes taken fromOvid'sMetamorphoses.At first glance, both scenes appear to show two female lovers in a wooded landscape. But the goddess of the hunt on the left actually represents the godJupiter, who has taken the form of Diana in order to seduce one of her followers. The eagle with thunderbolts in its claws, a symbol of Jupiter, is a clue to his presence.On the right, an old woman in heavy robes is reallyVertumnus, the god of orchards, disguised in order to enter the garden ofPomona, the young goddess of gardens. Identified by her attributes of fruit, flowers, and a watering can, she suspects nothing and dreamily listens to Vertumnus, who sits beside her.Imitating paintings, theseroundelsare set in oval frames, with the artist Franois Boucher's signature woven into the right scene. A decorative setting known as analentourssurrounds the two simulated paintings. As in the other tapestries in this set, thick garlands of flowers, exotic birds, and metalwork vases fill this border. Musical and hunting trophies hang beneath each roundel.The tapestry is based on designs by Maurice Jacques, Louis Tessier, and Jacques Neilson.
An ovalroundelimitating a framed painting fills the center of this tapestry. In a scene fromVirgil'sAeneid,the goddessVenusapproaches her husbandVulcan, trying to coax him to make weapons for her mortal sonAeneas. She has just descended from her chariot in the clouds on the left, accompanied by six white doves and acupid. Vulcan sits with his hammer and sword, while two cyclopes work in his forge on the right.The designers expanded the size of the wide border, known as thealentours,to fill the required space on a particularly long wall. The floral garlands, metal vases, and exotic birds are elements common to several of the other tapestries in this set, but two new trophies hanging from blue ribbons were added. To the left hangs an ornament symbolizing pastoral music by incorporating a horn, a book of music, and two tambourines. To the right, a straw basket, shepherd's horn, a drum, and floral headbands symbolize pastoral activities.This tapestry is also based on designs by Louis Tessier and Jacques Neilson.
Based on Book VII ofOvid'sMetamorphoses,theroundelin this tapestry shows Aurora, goddess of the dawn, gazing upon the sleeping form of her lover, the hunter Cephalus. She sits among clouds with the morning star shining on her forehead. Cephalus, a mortal who is bound to the earth, reclines on the forest floor, but his dog awakens as the goddess approaches.This roundel imitates a painting set in an oval frame, complete with Franois Boucher's signature under Cephalus. Exotic birds and a hunting trophy in the center ornament thealentoursor decorative setting, which was narrower than others in the set in order to fit the shorter wall of a room.This tapestry is also based on designs by Louis Tessier and Jacques Neilson.
In this tapestry, one of a set of four,Venusrises from turbulent waters in the centerroundel. Artists in the 1700s based this popular subject on various writings from ancient Greece and Rome. The roundel imitates a painting set in an oval frame, complete with Franois Boucher's signature on a rock. The scene is also inscribed with1766,the date the design orcartoonwas produced, rather than the year the tapestry was woven. Exotic birds, floral garlands, and a musical ornament in the center decorate thealentoursor border, which was narrower than others in the set in order to fit the shorter wall of a room.This tapestry also is based on designs by Louis Tessier.
A young woman reclines on a tiger skin on a marble ledge while her companion teases her with a dress pin. They are dressed in diaphanous robes fashioned afterchitonsworn by women in ancient Greece. Another dress pin and the reclining woman's hair ribbon lie scattered on the marble floor.For over half a century after the continued excavations ofPompeiibegan in 1748, artists were fascinated with Greek and Roman life. John William Godward painted many scenes like this one of idealized beauties in calm, often sterile environments. In this painting, the figure of Repose is arranged seductively, with her breast and nipple showing through the thin material of her dress. But there is something distinctly untouchable about these women; they do not engage the viewer with an inviting gaze nor solicit personal contact. Like theirantiquesetting, they possess a monumental, marmoreal quality, resembling Greek statues frozen in time.
The woman's brightly colored antique dress, not authentic but suggestive ofantiquity, contrasts sharply with the smooth marblebalustradesupporting her, whose open stonework was based on ancient models. While setting and costume allude to the ancient past, this painting's theme is timeless: waiting to hear from a loved one. The seascape in thebackground, the young woman's gesture, and her diaphanous gown, slightly rippling like a flag, all suggest an awaited signal from her beloved.Though rendering the scene so prettily as to nullify any true anxiety, John William Godward did tap into a universal feeling, the isolation experienced in the midst of uncertainty. He specialized in portraying women alone in settings from antiquity, often inbustportraits, usually decorative, dark-haired beauties in see-through gowns created with ingenious contrasts of colors and flesh tones.
Lost in her thoughts, a languid young woman lounges on a smooth, veined marble bench terminating in ahermfigure, probably representing the type of the poetHomerwith its heavy beard, thick hair and narrow ribbon around the head. The cloth wrapped around her hips, over her silkychiton, or tunic, is not an authentic element of ancient costume, but it bears a repeatedpalmetteborder based on a common ancient design. The fluffy, spotted animal fur is almost tactile but has no specific connection toantiquity. John William Godward probably included it for the delight of juxtaposing such varied textures and colors. He painted the silk, fur, and marble with great accuracy, approaching photographicrealism, and arranged them to enliven the subtly coloredcomposition.Godward specialized in portraying women alone in settings suggesting antiquity, usually decorative, dark-haired beauties in diaphanous gowns created with ingenious contrasts of colors and flesh tones.
The top of this small table folds open, revealing a circular scene of three women dressed in exotic costumes and taking tea under the pulled-back curtains of a tent. A monkey and a parrot perch in the branches of trees blossoming in thebackground. Themarquetrytea scene and the table's sturdy tripod form suggest this table was used to support a tea or coffee tray.Veneered with pewter and brass, the table's major decorative elements are of tortoiseshell; this form of decoration is known ascontre partie.The table was probably made for theGrand Dauphin, the oldest son of Louis XIV, King of France. It prominently displays five fleurs-de-lis, theheraldiclily from the royal arms of France, and four dolphins, symbol of the Dauphin. At this date royalemblemsappeared only on royal gifts or on objects made for members of the royal family.
In the foreground, Vulcan has just pulled off the net in which he ensnared his wifeVenusand her loverMars; the other gods, called in by Vulcan, join in the ridicule from above. Seemingly without effort, Hendrick Goltzius integrated two groups of nudes in complex poses, filling out the composition withCupidat the lower right and Vulcan forging the net in the background.Goltzius made this drawing as a full-scale model for an engraving in the manner of Bartholomus Spranger. Spranger's mythological compositions featured complex, erotic poses, and Goltzius adopted the style for a number of drawings and engravings. The engraving after this drawing, Goltzius's largest and most complex in Spranger's style, helped to secure his reputation on its publication in 1585. The inscription on the engraving,HGoltzius invenit sculpsit et divulgavit, confirms that Goltzius acted as designer, engraver, and publisher for the print.
Hendrick Goltzius created this drawing as one of many  fantasy  portraits that he made after 1600. Because he drew the portrait in preparation for awoodcut, he chose his technique accordingly, creating shading and modeling with lines that could be carved in relief in a block of wood.Goltzius had an uncanny talent of emulating the styles of the great masters, which he often displayed in these imaginary portraits. Here he took up Lucas van Leyden's manner, particularly in the flowing hatching of the fur collar and the rounded modeling of the fingers. Goltzius also gave pronounced emphasis to feathers, hair, and fur, aspects of his drawing that epitomized the styles of past Northern European masters. This imaginary portrait seems so lifelike and individualized that earlier scholars identified it with a specific person.
The large head of an angel in profile nearly fills the sheet of paper on which it is drawn. The grand scale of the image as well as the broad handling of the chalk are characteristic of Hendrick Goltzius's tendency to explore concerns more usually associated with painting in his later drawings. The figure in this drawing closely resembles theArchangel Gabrielin Goltzius's painting in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow; like this drawing, the painting is signed and dated 1609.This drawing was not made in preparation for the painting, however. Like several other large imaginary heads and figures Goltzius produced in this period, it was probably made as a finished work of art in its own right.
These chairs were part of a suite of eight side chairs and eight armchairs made for the French queen Marie-Antoinette (reigned 1774-1792). Designed in theNeoclassicalstyle with carved bands of ivy, laurel wreaths, and fluting, they stood in thesalon du rocherof the Belvedere Pavilion located in the gardens of the palace ofVersailles.
Elegance, sophistication, and worldliness define this portrayal of Mary, Joseph, and the Christ Child. Embedded in a fantastic cityscape with an elaborate fountain, the half-hidden figure of Joseph draws the viewer's attention, as do the lilies symbolizing the Virgin's purity in the right foreground. Contemporary taste in Antwerp and Brussels, where this painting was probably made, demanded that nearly every inch of a picture be filled with activity or ornament and that it be as ornate and decorative as possible. Even Mary's headdress provided an opportunity for an eye-catching, energetic shape fluttering against the flowering vines.Jan Gossaert set the figures in an inventive complex of pseudo-antique architecture, indicating his general awareness of Italian styles, probably gained through prints from Italy, which often circulated in Northern Europe, rather than from actual experience.
Francesco de los Cobos y Molina, the powerful secretary and chief financial advisor to Emperor Charles V, poses in front of a swath of drapery, looking warily out at the viewer. Previously unidentified, two clues have led to Francesco's identification as the portrait's subject: the red cross emblazoned on his doublet and the gem-encrusted jewel in the shape of a scallop shell. Both are emblems of the chivalric Order of Santiago, Saint James the Greater.As an artist to several courts, Jan Gossaert traveled widely throughout Europe and became one of the first painters to disseminate the Italian Renaissance style in the Netherlands. In this painting, Gossaert combines psychological insight, keen observation of form, and a facility for imitating surface textures to create a portrait that is both imposing and believable.
This female figure reclining with her arms crossed is typical of the sculpture of the Cyclades in the mid-2000s B.C. Scholars have dividedCycladicsculpture into groups or types indicating stylistic and chronological developments. Named for a cemetery on the island of Naxos, the Spedos group is the most common type of Cycladic figure. This broken example belongs to the Late Spedos type. Characteristic features of this group include overall flatness, little bend in the knees, a deeply cut channel between the legs, and an almost complete dependence on incision to define body parts.
Designed to hold logs,firedogsorchenetstake their name from the French word for a small dog. Pairs of firedogs were placed inside the fireplace, their gilt bronze decoration concealing the wrought-iron bars that supported the burning wood. The gilt bronze elements were often detachable from the iron supports, so that they could be removed and placed safely aside when the fire was lit.After the death of Louise-Jeanne de Durfort, the duchesse de Mazarin, in 1781, an auction of her possessions included in its catalogue a detailed description of firedogs resembling this pair. The catalogue entry notes that the firedogs were made by  Gouttier --for Pierre Gouthire, the most famous bronze caster in France in the late 1700s.
Both the form and ornament of these candelabra epitomize the FrenchNeoclassicalstyle: young mermen kneel on the handles clutching horns of plenty, crossed sprays of oak leaves frame female masks, and bunches of grapes, blossoms, and pinecones decorate the removable stoppers that project from the tops of the candle holders. The contrastingburnishedand matte gilded surfaces of the twisted, fluted neck and the gadrooned base of the vase are typical decoration for the period.
Several skilled craftsmen collaborated to produce these elaborate wall lights, as strictguildregulations restricted the work their members could perform. The architect Franois-Joseph Blanger produced the design from which a wax model was then made. Next, a bronze caster poured the bronze into the mold, and finally a skilled bronze worker, such as Pierre Gouthire, gilded and delicatelychasedthe surface of the wall lights.
Made in theNeoclassicalstyle, this monumental rolltop desk is fitted with numerous complicated mechanical devices, the specialty of David Roentgen's workshop. When the writing surface is pulled out, a mechanism automatically withdraws the solid rolltop back into the carcass, displaying the drawers and pigeon holes inside the desk. Behind the large gilt bronze plaque in the middle of the top is a contraption of many parts that moves out and opens at the turn of a key. It contains a folding reading and writing stand with compartments that hold an inkwell and sand pot for use by a person standing at the closed desk.
The Marquesa de Santiago stands full-length in front of a landscape of gently sloping hills. Well-born, very wealthy, and a commanding presence, she confronts the viewer directly. Her white lace mantilla extends to her knees, and she holds a closed fan in her left hand. Heavily applied make-up accentuates her  features. Known for her dissolute lifestyle, the Marquesa died at the age of forty-three, three years after this portrait was made. An English visitor to Spain once described her as  very profligate and loose in her manners and conversations, and scarcely admitted into female societyand said to boast of her nocturnal revels. While contemporary portraitists sought to convey ideal beauty with a highly finished technique, Goya used a more expressionistic handling of the paint. Broad, quick brushstrokes describe her dark dress, and the application of thick impasto suggests the gold braid on the Marquesa's sleeve and lace of her mantilla. In the background, crude cottages and trees are merely indicated with wide, rapid sweeps of the brush.
Throughout his work, Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes expressed himself freely and often with humor. This page from his  Album C  seems, at first glance, to be one of his depictions of working girls. This young woman, however, wears a fine dress, jewelry, and a rather coy hairstyle and displays a graceful, almost cultivated bearing. She is pretty, not vacuous, but her questioning gaze and awkward cradling of the jug betray her uncertainty. Goya's caption, the drawing's title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding. At least seventy years old when he made this drawing, Goya remained fluid and spontaneous in his technique, quickly capturing the swaying of her skirt and the little crinkles in her sleeve.
A sculptor chisels away at his statue of an ideal woman. Francisco Jos Goya y Lucientes here referred to the mythological story of Pygmalion, the legendary king of Cyprus who fell in love with a statue. According to Ovid, Pygmalion carved the statue from ivory with wonderful artistry. Every night he prayed to Venus that he might have a wife as beautiful as the image he had created. Finally, the goddess caused the statue to come to life. As Pygmalion's wife, she came to be called Galatea.In a possible self-portrait, Goya depicted Pygmalion with his legs spread wide, readying himself to take a mighty swing at the chisel, which is aimed at Galatea's crotch. Leaning slightly forward, she looks out with a fearful expression. Goya's animated interpretation of the well-known myth is highly original and even mocking. Free application of sepia wash shows Goya's complete command of the range of tones available in this medium.
An urbane Spaniard--probably a self-portrait of the artist--makes an obscene gesture at the Napoleon-like dwarfs threatening him with daggers. The title inscribed below the image,Despreciar los ynsultos(Despise the insults), seems to signify Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes's defiance toward the French military occupation of Spain. The difference of scale between the tall, patronizing Spaniard and his squat, gloomy oppressors reinforces the point.Often politically motivated, Goya's art presented private exploits and tragedies with both satire and an awareness of the human condition that made his observations timeless and universal. He began to use the more intimate mediums of drawings and prints for his purposeful and serious satires after 1792. Goya made this sketch, sixteenth of about fifty drawings in the  Black Border  album, for his own amusement and interest rather than for sale or other purposes.
An extremely aged figure of a man hobbles along with two canes, overwhelmed by the weight of his own body. Drawn from life, the figure presents a universal image of old age, while the inscription flatly describes physical and mental frailty and hints at sexual impotence. Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes made the drawing at age sixty and had himself survived a serious illness; along with several other studies of old people, he included this drawing in his now-dispersed  Album D. For Goya, the paper played as strong a role as brush and india ink. He enhanced the old man's sense of isolation by placing him low on the page, allowing the blank background to suggest his loneliness. Blank paper evokes his bald head, and the india ink provided clean black strokes and exceptionally fine gray washes for the high dramatic contrasts Goya valued. Few of his more than a thousand known drawings are purely linear, fitting for the artist who first declared that nature contains no lines.
Before a mesmerized crowd, man and beast dramatically confront one another. The fiercely determinedpicadorleans forward and gathers all his strength, readying himself to stab the impassive bull with his sharp lance. Dying or wounded animals lie on the ground, and the bloody undersides of thepicador'shorse convey the abusive and violent aspects of the sport of bullfighting. The bull coolly eyes his opponent as a group of fearful men try to distract the savage animal.Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes painted this work late in his career when he had begun experimenting with different techniques. Showing remarkable freedom, Goya used a heavily loaded brush, a palette knife, a rag, and even his fingers to apply paint to the canvas. Thick black strokes of paint suggest tension and movement, while dark shadows and a faceless crowd in the background lend an ominous air to this emotional confrontation.
A gaunt man in tattered clothes sits clutching a basket. He is starving, as suggested by the title of the drawing:Se muer[en] (They are dying). On the other side of the emaciated figure, faces stare out from the shadows. Another basket sits empty in the foreground.The rough and energetic handling of black chalk expresses the seriousness of the subject matter in this drawing of intense pathos. This drawing comes from  Album G,  one of the two albums Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes compiled when he was living in Bordeaux at the end of his life. Many of the sheets from the series show Goya's interest in representing people on the fringes of society. He often chose disturbing subject matter to point out humanity's injustice and hypocrisy.
In Jan van Goyen's world, the sky goes on forever, the land is broad and flat, and the air is almost palpable. The water, nearly glass-smooth, reflects clouds, castle and boats gliding across it. A coach-and-four with red-coated coachman and passengers skates across on a ferry, lobster fishermen draw up their net, and cows complacently drink in the tranquility. A restrainedpaletteof blue, silvery gray, and pale green envelops the castle of Wijk, making it seem more a fairy-tale place than an actual building near Duurstede, a town southeast of Utrecht where the Rhine forks.Van Goyen consistently showed skill in rendering nearly monochrome landscapes and recording the subtly shifting tonal effects of the moist Dutch air. This painting exemplifies a new phase of Dutch landscape painting established about 1630, which was distinguished by modest, domestic subject matter, a low vantage point, and a palette limited in color but richly varied in tone.
With energetic and varied strokes of black chalk, Jan van Goyen described a crowded village festival. A large tent has been erected in front of the church on the left and hung with a flag. On a raised platform in front of it, three musicians play the fiddle and tambourine while townsfolk sit and listen. A covered carriage draws up to the scene, and a couple greets the new arrivals. In the center of the field, two other stalls provide shelter for those selling their wares.Van Goyen took full advantage of the diverse action to create a lively and entertainingcomposition. Peasant sellers and elegant and ordinary shoppers alike discuss and examine the varied goods for sale. Using fluid strokes, van Goyen suggested people's faces with circles and the outlines of buildings, animals, and foliage with rapid, vivid lines.Van Goyen frequently traveled about the Netherlands as a picture dealer, valuer, and speculator in tulip bulbs, land, and houses. Based on the sights he had seen on his trips, he made many elaborate drawings like this one in his studio.
Creating an interlocking figure eight with their bodies, two dancing peasants fill the page, with the male peasant obscuring his partner's head and pinching her buttock. Urs Graf showed them dancing upon a featureless strip of ground prominently signed and dated with a dynamic insignia of his initials overlaid with the Swiss dagger. Their forms merge at the top and widen to form a pyramid that emphasizes their lower bodies, muscular legs, and wide feet, conveying a powerful sense of energy. Graf's swift, incisive penwork emphasizes the then-commonplace notion that peasants were symbols of the cycles of nature: earthy, fertile, full of vital strength--and often bawdy.Someone extensively pricked the drawing with holes that follow the outline of the figures and the back has been rubbed with black chalk. Scholars once thought that this pricking indicated that such drawings had been made as designs for prints, with the image transferred onto another surface by rubbing chalk dust through the holes. They now believe that another draftsman pricked the work much later in order to copy it.
One of the rounded arches in the tomb of the French King Louis-Philippe forms the dark frame of this scene, drawing the viewer's eye into the lighter interior beyond. The strong perspectival grid of the floor tiles anchors the scene, while the repeating patterns of the arches above and the large tombs of the Orlans family in the side alcove create another design. In contrast to the massive architectural forms, the priests, choir boys, and female parishioners who kneel in prayer seem small and insignificant.Franois-Marius Granet specialized in scenes where the changing patterns of light became the focus of dimly lit interiors. In one of his few works to be completed in pen and ink alone, Granet further emphasized the strong effects of light and dark by using hatching and cross-hatching. He delighted in exploring the visual impact of varied, dense lines, suggesting textures and surfaces with numerous delicate strokes.
The kicking horse twists his head back as if to be sure he is aiming correctly at the attacking lion or boar, now lost, that originally formed part of the sculpture. His tail swirls in the air while he pricks up his ears and furrows his brow. These expressive details of the horse, caught in action, add to the sense of intense struggle. The artist Caspar Gras's  interest in dramatic moments and spontaneous movement is characteristic of the Baroque style.Possibly one of the earliest known Baroque bronze horses shown kicking both rear feet in the air, this sculpture's creation was made possible by new technical advances. Beginning about 1600, thinner, lighter casts allowed sculptors to balance the metal's weight on only two points. Sculptors also perfected the technique of casting bronze figures in parts, allowing for compositions with many projecting, separately cast elements.
 [P]art apparition from the past, part record of the present  aptly describes John Beasly Greene's desolate view of the ruins of the Temple of Amon at Thebes, Egypt, built by King Amenhotep III, who reigned from 1390 to 1353 B.C. At the left a solitary palm tree encroaches into the space, leaning toward the remains of the once majestic colonnade of fourteen fifty-two-foot-high pillars withpapyruscapitals. On the right are the remains of the largeperistylecourt. Greene has photographed the ruins from a great distance, making them appear rather small.
Gentle colors, a dilapidated, long-abandoned artificial-flower arrangement, and weeds overrunning the scene create an appropriately nostalgic tone and underscore the irony of this  forgotten memorial.  Capturing the melancholy of such subjects as a neglected gravesite, William Greiner's series of cemetery photographs called  The Reposed  continued a tradition begun with post-mortem photographs in the 1800s. While all photographs are arguably memorials of people and moments past, this series deals more explicitly with death and photography's peculiar relationship to it.
In Jean-Baptiste Greuze's moralizing narrative paintings, facial expression and gesture were key to telling the story, and his contemporaries greatly admired his skills. In drawn studies such as this one, he departed from the high drama of his paintings and captured his sitter's individual character with sympathy and humility. A consummate draftsman, Greuze made many vivid, expressive, large-scale head studies in chalk, which he did not necessarily intend for specific paintings; sometimes they were later engraved and distributed as prints.This drawing may be a study for the old man seated at the right of the paintingL'Aveugle trompin Moscow's Pushkin Museum.
 This little laundress is charming, but she's a rascal I wouldn't trust an inch,  the criticDenis Diderotdeclared when this painting was first exhibited in 1761. Indeed, Jean-Baptiste Greuze stripped the traditional theme of the washerwoman of its association with the virtue of hard work and instead overlaid it with a titillating sensuality typical ofRococoart. In a room scattered with wet and drying laundry, a disheveled maidservant with an exposed stocking and slipper fixes the viewer with a provocative gaze.Greuze used a heavily loaded brush to apply patches of paint that describe texture and surface: the folds of the young woman's dress, the heaviness of wet cloth, the dull sheen on the pewter jug, and the grainy texture of wood.
When the aged Cimon was forced to starve in prison before his execution, his devoted daughter Pero secretly visited her father to nourish him at her own breast. In hisMemorable Acts and Sayings of the Ancient Romans, the ancient Roman historian Valerius Maximus, Pero's selfless devotion was presented as the highest example of honoring one's parent.In the 1600s, major artists painted dramatic versions of the popular subject, which Jean-Baptiste Greuze and other artists revived a century later. Closely basing the setting and arrangement of figures on Peter Paul Rubens's version, Greuze probably made this oil sketch as the final stage of preparation for an unexecuted, large-scale painting. Contemporaries admired the rapid execution, vibrant colors, and lively paint handling in Greuze's oil sketches. The criticDenis Diderotlavishly praised his combination ofgenreandhistory paintingand his public, moralizing purpose.
A consummate draftsman, Jean-Baptiste Greuze made many vivid, expressive large-scale head studies in red chalk, his favorite medium for drawing. Here he only quickly indicated the woman's cap and hood, concentrating his attention on the emotional and expressive qualities of her haggard face with its furrowed brow, penetrating eyes, and parted lips.Greuze made this drawing as a preparatory study for the figure of a woman kneeling at her husband's bedside in one of his best-known paintings,La Dame de Charit, completed in 1775 at the height of his career. Greuze's narrative paintings were highly theatrical, with facial expression and gesture conveying the story. As seen here, Greuze usually heightened the drama by depicting his figures at the peak of emotion.
A woman encourages a hesitant young girl to present a purse of money to a bedridden couple, who lean forward to express their gratitude. While the mother urges her child to hand the purse to the old man, anunand two young men wait their turn to extend charity. Jean-Baptiste Greuze portrayed the mother and daughter in fine clothing to emphasize the disparity between their lives and that of the impoverished couple, whose only valuable possession, a sword, is prominently displayed behind them. Greuze was famous for moralizing images like this one, which were meant to illustrate the importance of good deeds and childhood instruction in a domestic setting. InThe Charitable Woman,a complex scene that explores a wide range of human expression, he used spontaneous applications of wash to intensify the sense of drama.Greuze producedThe Charitable Womanas a compositional study for a painting of the same name,now in the Muse des Beaux-Arts, Lyon. Prior to making this drawing, he made numerous studies of individual figures, such as theStudy of the Head of an Old Woman,who is one of the principal characters in this scene. These carefully rendered drawings provide evidence of Greuze's working methods and testify to his careful preparation.
In this dramatic story, a son deserts his family, including an aged father, to join the army. Broad gestures, theatrical poses, and striking facial expressions communicate variations of two primary emotions, agony and distress. The cursing father on the left reaches with outstretched hands to his departing son, while the female members of the family plead desperately. Even the baby clings anxiously to his brother's coattails. The son stretches out his arm as he advances toward the door, where his bemused companion observes the scene.Although Jean-Baptiste Greuze often made preparatory drawings of individual figures for majornarrativeworks like this one, he seems to have made this large and highly finished drawing after his own painting of this subject in theMuse du Louvre. Thesquaringlines for transfer indicate that he probably intended to use the drawing for an engraving.
Seemingly unaware of the activity all around him, a youth supine is the focus of gods; some tease and tempt him with pleasurable offerings, while others guide him toward prudence.  Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, grasps his left hand urging him toward virtuous restraint. The god of wine, Bacchus, pours wine onto the young man to arouse his desires. Cupid, the tiny child-god of love, directs the youth's face toward his mother Venus who presses her right breast, emblematic of sybaritic pleasures.The entire surface of the vessel is carved and showcases the technical virtuosity of its maker, Balthasar Griessmann. This ivory specialist skillfully moved between different degrees of relief: from figures fully sculpted in three-dimensions to extremely shallow passages. Floral Bacchic motifs cover the lid, base, and stem of the vessel. Putti bearing fruit-laden garlands cavort around the lid, which is surmounted at the pinnacle with a single putto brandishing a cup in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. At the base lie recumbent drunken putti and satyrs.Griessmann faithfully derived the goblet's composition from a work by Otto van Veen,Allegory of the Temptations of Youth, known to the carver from a print by Antwerp artist Pieter Perret. Griessmann cunningly puts the allegory in the hands of the imbiber, who--like the youth--should consider the balance of indulgence with moderation. The virtuosity of the piece is such that it was most likely displayed at courtly banquets--a showpiece, to be viewed and admired, rather than utilized.
In 1922, Oskar Schlemmer premiered his  Triadic Ballet  in Germany. He named the piece  Triadic  because it was literally composed of multiples of three: three acts, colors, dancers, and shapes. Concentrating on its form and movement, Schlemmer explored the body's spatial relationship to its architectural surroundings. Although an abstract design, the spiral costume derived from the tutus of classical ballet.
Two contemporary Bolognese draftsmen worked at different times on this unique drawing. Sculptor Alessandro Algardi added the figures after painter Francesco Grimaldi had created the landscape. By inserting the Holy Family, which fits so naturally into the composition, the elder Algardi may have meant to improve his junior colleague's composition. The figural group balances the central tree and gives the landscape a recognizable subject matter. To achieve greaterluster, Algardi also may have added the brownwashthroughout.The artists' styles are distinctive. Algardi drew his playful family grouping with a more delicate, graceful, even fragile line than Grimaldi's bold squiggles and hatching, which are especially evident in the dynamic, dominant tree.These two artists often worked together on architectural commissions, yet only one other similar sheet exists, an architectural drawing in which Algardi corrected and added to Grimaldi's work. This drawing could have been made in preparation for Grimaldi's etching of the same subject.
On February 8, 1807,Napoleonfought a bloody, indecisive battle against combined Russian and Prussian forces near Eylau, a town in East Prussia on the Polish border. Five weeks later, the director of the Muse Napoleon announced a competition for the commission to paint the Emperor on the battlefield the day after the actual fighting. The director ordered the artists to show the Emperor surveying the battlefield and directing his troops to assist the wounded. A specific story was to be included, involving a wounded Lithuanian soldier who offered his allegiance to the Emperor if he would heal him.Scholars believe this drawing was made by Antoine-Jean Gros as apreliminary studyfor an oil sketch that eventually won him the commission for the final painting, now in theMuse du Louvre. The artist quickly and loosely sketched his early ideas in pencil first and then drew over the outlines in thick black ink. He placed the Emperor Napoleon in the center of the scene, riding among the wounded and dying. The wounded Lithuanian soldier reaches up to attract Napoleon's attention as he approaches. This compositional sketch concentrates on the figures' positions and gestures rather than details of costume and facial expressions.
Scenes of combat decorate this Athenianblack-figureneck-amphora. On the front of the vase, the Greek heroTheseusbattles the Minotaur. The Minotaur, a monster with a bull's head and a human body, lived in a labyrinth on the island of Crete and devoured human sacrifices sent as tribute from Athens. The hero has just stabbed the beast with his sword, and blood streams from the wound. A youth and a girl--representatives of the fourteen youths and maidens saved from sacrifice by Theseus's victory over the monster-stand at each side watching.The heroic combat on the front is balanced by a scene of mortal warriors on the back of the vase. Two hoplites, or heavily armed soldiers, face off with spears raised, between onlookers. The woman holds a wreath for the victor.The artists of Group E consciously broke with convention. Although the main scenes on this vase are not unusual, the artists of Group E combined them with new ornamental patterns and placed them on a special form of neck-amphora that they invented, with a wide neck opening and a broad shoulder.
Three boys wearing leafy crowns play knucklebones on this Athenianred-figureoinochoeor jug. This special form of oinochoe, called a chous, was used during the Anthesteria, a three-day festival in honor ofDionysos, the god of wine. On the first day of the festival, the new wine was opened; a drinking contest on the second day used these jugs to hold a standard amount of wine.The scenes depicted on the choes often portray the revelry of the festival and the activities of children. The prevalent role of children in the decoration of choes presumably reflects the importance of the festival to children. On the second day of the festival, in addition to the drinking contest, three-year-old boys were formally accepted into their fathers' kinship groups, becoming part of the community.
The owl was the symbol of the city of Athens. On this red-figurekalpis, an owl stands framed by olive branches, each bearing one fruit. This decoration is unusual for a kalpis, yet the image would have been familiar to any Athenian because the owl, shown with one olive branch, had been on the obverse, or front side, of Athenian coins since the late 600s B.C. The owl between olive branches subsequently became a popularmotifonskyphoior cups in Athens in the period around 475 to 425 B.C.Greeks used the kalpis, a variant form ofhydria, for carrying water. The three handles of a hydria were designed to facilitate pouring and lifting. Most vase-painters working in thered-figure techniquepreferred the rounded form of the kalpis.
This unusual object is the only known Italian eighteenth-century tabletop made ofmaiolica. The top is divided into four hunting scenes, with exotic subjects such as Moors hunting elephants and ostriches each framed by an elaborate cartouche. Such typicalRococomotifsas intertwining vegetation, fruit swags, and pastoral scenes fill the intervening spaces. The delicate painting in a predominantly green and yellowish-greenpaletteis typical of objects produced by Francesco Saverio Grue in his family's workshop, long connected with the manufacture of painted maiolica at Castelli, near Naples.The tabletop was originally set into a contemporary base for use as an occasional table or gueridon. Gueridons--circular, tray-like tabletops set on column or tripod supports--first appeared in France around the middle of the 1600s; this table form soon spread to Italy, where it remained popular until the end of the 1700s. The Getty Museum's tabletop shows Grue's skill as a maiolica artist, not only because of the delicate glazed decoration but also because he successfully kiln-fired a large object without warping and cracking it.
Francesco Guardi based this drawing on a picture much like one by Luca Carlevarijs, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, London. It is acapriccio, an imaginary view that was popular in Italy in the 1700s, and Guardi created many similar imaginary scenes of Venetian life. This scene is rendered in light brown tones, with both pen and ink, with wash. The shoreline is accented with white highlights. The combination of hazy brown shading and placid water gives the impression of a summer evening, just before sunset.
A luminous morning haze bathes Venice's Grand Canal. Guided by oarsmen, gondolas and cargo boats glide through the placid water; their hulls traverse the gentle reflections cast by the surrounding buildings. Masts and vertical pilings punctuate the pale, overcast sky. Buildings of varying shapes and scale--but all sharing a muted palette--extend from edge to edge and deep into the distance. On the right, a few early-risers mill about on the banks of the canal.Francesco Guardi often paintedvedute,or views, of Venice's principal waterway. Many of the buildings in this view were palaces of important Venetian families. The most prominent among them is the two-toned Palazzo Bembo on the canal's left bank. Its owners, and Guardi's likelypatrons, even appear on the palace's upper balcony.Guardi appreciated Venice as a city of constant change rather than as a static tourist destination. On the right side, behind the tiny figures on shore, he depicted the Church of San Geremia in the midst of its renovation. The two-toned facade of the Palazzo Bembo draws attention to a recent addition to thisRenaissancepalace. Amid this urban transformation, Guardi reveals the transitory effects of weather and water on his life-long home of Venice.
An elegantly dressed crowd gathers to watch a play in a large salon with a high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The mostly male spectators wear long frock coats, three-cornered hats, and hair tied behind in ponytails. Francesco Guardi quickly sketched the outline of the figures and architecture, and then applied strokes of brown wash to suggest shadows or the texture of fabric. Patches of wash suggest the arches around the windows and create depth on the raised platform of the stage.This sketch commemorates a performance of thecommedia dell'arteon January 21, 1782, in Venice for Grand Duke Paul Petrovitch of Russia and his wife Maria Fedorovna. As part of their tour across Europe, traveling under the pseudonym  Comte et Comtesse du Nord,  the Grand Duke and Duchess stayed in Venice between January 18 and 25. Guardi drew several paintings and drawings to record their visit.
Francesco Guardi set up his easel on the south side of Campo San Polo, in Venice, to capture the north side of the square on a sunny day in the late 1700s. The Campo San Polo was a residential square, unlike the famous tourist spot, Saint Mark's, that he usually sketched.Guardi filled the scene with minute details for an intimate glimpse of urban life in Venice. He paid great attention to delineating the intricate colonnades along the facades of the palaces on the right. The buildings on the left are more varied in type and height, penetrated here and there with windows and arcades, their chimneys rising into the expanse of sky.Across the square, loosely drawn couples stop to chat in the sunshine, bend to examine something on the ground, or walk hand-in-hand. These small details not only give a sense of the square's great scale and height but also humanize the scene. Guardi usedwashthroughout to create a lively play of light and shadow.
This heavily draped figure may beSaint Mary Magdaleneor a monastic saint. An energetic tangle of line represents a crucifix floating above her, surrounded by angels. In the lower left lies one of her attributes, a skull, representing penitence and the transience of life.Antonio Guardi approached this drawing with the same fluid freedom he demonstrated in his paintings. He began with an ample red chalk underdrawing, followed with loosely applied pale reddish-brown washes. He then reinforced these areas with occasional broad accents of pen and added energy with liberal touches of whitegouachehighlights. The fluency of the wash combined with the energy of his handling conveys a sense of luminosity, while the startlingchiaroscuroeffects typify Guardi's approach to light and shadow. He probably made this drawing as a study for a small devotional painting, though it may also have simply been an exercise in drawing.
A crowned magus leans forward in adoration. His eyes are closed and he holds his right hand to his chest. The contours of this half-length figure are not sharply defined; rather, blocks of red-chalk shading create the form. The result is a shimmering and dynamiccompositionimbued with a flickering light. This drawing was presumably a preparatory study for a now unknown painting.
Set against a goldbackground, theMadonna and Childsit enclosed in aGothicframe with pointed arches and decorative twisting columns. In this single image, Guariento di Arpo combined three traditional pictorial representations of the Virgin. She sits on the ground nursing the infantChristas theMadonna of Humility, a representation that emphasizes her role as the compassionate, maternal intercessor for all who pray for Christ's mercy. At the same time, her crown points to her role as theQueen of Heaven. Finally, identified by the golden sun-brooch at her breast and the incised rays that emanate from her, she personifies the apocalyptic woman from the twelfth chapter of the biblical Book of Revelation. Above, a golden aureole of celestial light encloses the blessing figure of God the Father.
The figures on this clock represent Love conquering Time, a theme often repeated on French clocks of the early 1700s. Thecupidbalanced on the top originally held a long-handled scythe, anattributeof Father Time, who reclines below and holds his usual scales. The case's front and side surfaces areveneeredwith tortoiseshell, brass, and ebony. A recessed panel of blue horn, decorated with a brasstrellisenclosing rosettes, is set below the dial. The legs are also set with panels of blue horn, which still retains its vibrant color.While the clock's dial appears to be contemporary with the case, the movement is not. The blank gilt-bronze cartouche beneath the face may once have held an enamel plaque inscribed with the name of the original movement maker. Later in the eighteenth-century, Paul Gudin set the present movement in the case and painted his name on the enamel dial.
In his youth, Guercino made many drawings from nude models, often using charcoal, the traditional medium for such studies. Artists usually made such drawings from the nude, known asacadmies, in an art academy or in an artist's studio. Guercino probably made large-scale drawings like this one as demonstration pieces to inspire the pupils in his own academy. He made other oiled-charcoal nude studies of this model around the same time. For these studies, Guercino typically used rough, light-brown paper and charcoal soaked in oil, which made the line darker and more permanent. For luminosity, he added occasional touches of white chalk highlights. This combination enabled him to create luminous shadows or reflected light within deep shadow and to suggest the texture of flesh. His masterly technique simplified forms and distinctively modeled them with soft lines and broad shading to suggest the play of light.
Slanting light falls across the upper section of the painting, placing the left side of the sitter's face in shadow. He looks out of the picture, his eyes expressing weary concern. Shown in the act of reading a book at a small table, he seems more scholarly and retiring than powerfully vigorous.In 1621 Guercino was called to Rome from Bologna to paint this portrait of Pope Gregory XV. Although Guercino rarely painted portraits, he used a composition that had become a standard for papal portraiture since the Renaissance. But Guercino placed less emphasis on the trappings of power than earlier papal portraits and more on his subject's character. This portrait shows a keen psychological understanding of his patron's state of mind, capturing the pope at the end of his life, worn out by the cares of office and failing health.
The young Christ's fellow Jews surround him in the temple, listening attentively as he preaches. Some consult the Torah at the same time, passing it between them; other men in turbaned headdresses gaze up as Christ gestures towards heaven. In the background, an attentive crowd sits underneath the arches and columns of the classical synagogue.Guercino used brown ink energetically, describing the men's bodies swathed in long robes with quick, swirling pen strokes. The frenzied lines that surround Christ's upraised arm seem to suggest motion and his connection to his father above. Guercino used a top layer of brown wash to form hair, caps, beards, and shadows with broad, dark strokes.One of Guercino's followers used this drawing and two others as the basis of a painting of the same subject for the church of San Francesco in Ferrara.
Like most of Guercino's landscapes, this quiet view was probably imaginary and most likely was made as an independent work of art. To create the effect of calmness, Guercino balanced forms and masses, as in the fort's tower and the docked ship's mast, which are anchored by the curving, arched wall and its smoooth, flat counterpart bounding the glassy sea. He added floating sailboats and sliding gondolas, the fluttering flag, and small figures at the port to enliven his scene.Brown ink was Guercino's favorite medium for drawing. Here his crisp, clean lines and spare, somewhat abstract, architectural shapes give this drawing a feeling of modernity.
Guercino drew caricatures for his own amusement and that of his friends. He filtered his acute observations of the people and events of everyday life through his sharp perception of the comic, a precedent established by his Bolognese predecessors the Carracci, and before them, Leonardo Da Vinci.Working quickly, Guercino caricatured two middle-aged men gazing intently to the left. He depicted their faces in the most detail, yet even here he used only a few, well-placed lines to suggest a jawline or a beard. He then delicately touched essential areas with luminous wash in varied intensities. In particular, the face of the man at far left shows Guercino's subtle accuracy with wash, suggesting the effects of sunlight on his skin. The men's clothing is treated even more subtly: a hasty criss-cross of tangled lines describe the arms of the man at the left, folded in his baggy sleeves.
These fighting knights carry the banners of ancient feuding empires--SPQR, the banner of ancient Rome, at the left and the dragon, that ofGaul, at the right--yet they wear contemporary gold and silver Florentine armor and joust like Florentine knights of the 1400s. The brilliant colors and simplified geometric shapes make the armored steeds look much like rocking-horses, creating a resplendent yet artificial, fairy-tale battle scene. Despite the flatness of the sumptuous painted fabrics and the mere outlines of the horses' bodies--aside from the elegantlyforeshortenedwhite horse at the right--their hooves appear to exist in three-dimensional space.Giovanni di Ser Giovanni Guidi knew about battles, for he was once a mercenary soldier, but he did not intend this scene as a realistic depiction of warfare. It originally decorated the front of acassone,or wedding chest.
For all its magical veracity, thedaguerreotypelacked color. Since customers often preferred their likenesses to have color, handcolorists added blues, greens, yellows, browns, and whites. They often highlighted faces with a touch of rouge, as seen in this portrait of a cherubic infant. The daguerreotypist Jeremiah Gurney vignetted the boy's head and shoulders, which causes him to appear to float in the frame.
The bare chest and flexed biceps of this young American man might be interpreted as a metaphor for the strength, vigor, and optimism of America in the 1850s. Striking a pose of physical prowess yet exuding youthful vulnerability, the would-be pugilist awkwardly curls back his left fist in a gesture that almost suggests a battle with himself. His elongated neck makes his head seem nearly detached, hovering above his pale torso. The distinct, faint tan line across his neck and shoulders may betray his social class by indicating that he labored outdoors.
Having undertaken the task of seeking and explaining beauty in modernity, Monsieur G., enjoys depicting women in all their finery, their beauty enhanced by every kind of artifice...--Charles Baudelaire,The Painter of Modern Life, c.1860A fashionably dressed woman promenades through one of Paris' many parks. Protecting herself from the sun, she holds a small blue parasol and wears a bonnet. Touches of white--her gloves, sleeves, and flowing scarf--offset her blue and purple ensemble. Between her billowy sleeves and her gloves, the woman displays golden jewelry. She demurely reaches down with her left hand to hold up her voluminous dress. This mass of material contrasts sharply with her small head and single foot peaking out from below.The woman's immense dress would have been supported by an elaborate structure of crinolines or stiffened petticoats. Constantin Guys produced this drawing at the height of fashion for crinolines and full skirts. To suggest many layers of thin fabric, Guys built up layer upon layer of wash and repeating triangles drawn in ink. Guys' attention to contemporary fashion and make-up made him Charles Baudelaire's quintessential painter of modern life. But Baudelaire championed  Monsieur G  not merely for conveying appearances and artifice. For Baudelaire, Guys' watercolors and drawings not only captured his subjects in the present moment, but also imbued them with a look of timelessness, elevating them to the status of historical figures.
Observed by his symbol, the eagle, and poised to write God's words, Saint John looks up for divine inspiration, which he receives as brilliant light. Saint John, the Galilean fisherman who became one of Christ's apostles, is traditionally considered the author of theGospelaccording to John and of the Bible's Book of Revelation. Hals used only light and handling of paint to create the lifelike, fleeting quality that made his portraits so prized. He chose a dramatic moment, then captured it with bold, spontaneous brushwork. A contemporary reported that Hals called the final touches he made to his canvases  putting in his handwriting --adding the trademarkhighlightsthat give his pictures much of their sparkle.Treasured by both artists and royalty,Saint Johnwas owned by painter Gerard Hoet and later by Catherine the Great of Russia.
Adelaide Hanscom undertook the project of illustrating Omar Khayym's popularRubiytaround 1903, using many notable Bay Area literary figures and artists as her models. The sittings with Hanscom became highly sought-after, and the project was a major professional success for her.Thephotogravureprocess complements thePictorialistaesthetic with its softened edges andsepiatones. Hanscom's use of the tondo, or circular form, demonstrates the influence ofRenaissanceart in her work. This image came from a later edition of the book and is probably based upon ahand-colored photographby Hanscom or her studio partner Blanche Cumming.
Is Alex Harris mocking television or religious icons  He took this photograph, a still life from a series entitled  Red White Blue and God Bless You,  as an intimate glimpse into the co-existence of secular and sacred culture in the lives of his adopted community in northern New Mexico.
Color emerges very subtly in this nearly all white snowscape, with the green of the scattered hay in the middle ground bringing out the green of the nearly black pion bushes dotting the hillside. Alex Harris had initially feared that his photographs would be too dependent on color, but thiscompositionrelies more on the subtle shadows and contrasts of an engraving. The series to which this print belongs,  Red White Blue and God Bless You,  marked his first use of color, instead of black-and-white photography, to document northern New Mexico.
Amadeo's inscription above the doorway . . . summed up the spirit of the house:  I Love My God, I Love the Red White and Blue and You. Red White Blue and God Bless You. --Alex HarrisIn photographing the interior of Amadeo Sandoval's modest kitchen and bedroom, Alex Harris provided an intimate glimpse into the life of his adopted community in northern New Mexico. Both sensual and sorrowful, this image conveys the innate dignity Harris found not only in the home of Amadeo Sandoval but among all the residents of the region.Harris memorialized the vivid color schemes of his neighbors' homes and the high desert landscapes of northern New Mexico in his seriesRed White Blue and God Bless You, published in 1992, and named after an inscription on the wall of Amadeo's kitchen.
No church or temple or sanctuary had ever captivated me like Amadeo's home. He sanctified his rooms with icons of apostles, saints, and family photographs. Stars, flowers and hearts celebrated the many colored and carved crosses. In a rainbow of hues on walls, furniture, appliances and chairs, Amadeo depicted a loving and merciful God.   --Alex HarrisAlex Harris portrays the carpenter Amadeo Sandoval by photographing his home. Harris's intense color photography reveals the harmonies of a sparsely furnished adobe room with softly washed blue walls and a large chair draped with brightly colored fabric beside a yellow vinyl kitchen seat.Harris memorialized the vivid color schemes of his neighbors' homes and the high desert landscapes of northern New Mexico in his seriesRed White Blue and God Bless You, published in 1992, and named after an inscription on the wall of Amadeo's kitchen.
In presenting Caledonio Gallego's vibrantly decorated bedroom, Alex Harris revealed an individual's daily life as well as his human presence. After several months of living and working in a small Hispanic village in northern New Mexico, Harris realized that the photographs he made of his neighbors' vividly decorated living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens were as descriptive of their inhabitants as any conventional portrait. As a result, he began to focus less on the human subject in his photographs and more on the way a lived-in space betrays a specific presence.
Alfred A. Hart courageously positioned himself atop a steam engine to make thisstereographoverlooking Cape Horn and the American River gorge in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The tracks along this section of the Central Pacific Railroad, which are between twelve and twenty-two hundred feet above the bottom of the gorge, hug the steep mountainside, providing a thrilling experience for train passengers. Breathtaking views of the wilderness landscape added to the tourists' exhilaration.Cape Horn was a popular subject for photographers, who sold their images to the railroad, as well as to tourists who wanted souvenirs. After Hart's negatives became the property of the Central Pacific Railroad, other company photographers, including Carleton E. Watkins, subsequently printed them and  failed to properly credit Hart. Watkins made numerous fine photographs of Cape Horn himself; he printed Hart's image sometime around 1870.
The bold cliffs of Colorado's Ten Mile Canyon form a striking background for a Central Pacific Railroad train passing through on its way from California to Utah. Not visible in the image, however, are the Shoshone Indians who inhabited this region. While the railroad successfully united the states, it routinely disrupted the Native American environment and way of life. Trains brought settlers to the new, western lands and thus played a significant role in displacing native peoples.Though Alfred A. Hart made this stereograph, its mount bears Carleton E. Watkins's name. Watkins was a San Francisco-based photographer who also chose the railroad as a primary subject. Because Hart's negatives belonged to the Central Pacific Railroad, they were subsequently printed by other company photographers who, like Watkins, did not properly credit Hart.
Trains passing above the American River often stopped so that tourists and photographers could get out and gaze at the awe-inspiring gorge. While the tourists simply viewed the scenery, photographers like Alfred A. Hart documented the landscape and usually tried to incorporate part of the train in thecomposition. He then sold these photographs to tourists as souvenirs or to the railroad company for advertising purposes.Though Hart made thisstereograph, itsmountbears Carleton E. Watkins's name.

Between two rocky, imposing, vertical walls, sixty-three feet high and eight hundred feet long, passes a single pair of railroad tracks. Thisstereographdramatically depicts the Bloomer Cut corridor along the Central Pacific Railroad. Workers used five hundred kegs of gunpowder a day to blast through the naturally cemented gravel that formed this part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The gravel was so hard that they sometimes had difficulty drilling far enough in to place the gunpowder. After a successful blast, the gravel was removed one wheelbarrow at a time. It was harrowing work, and not even the overseer was spared from danger: he lost an eye after one faulty blast. The successful construction of this passage, which still exists, serves as a testament to the hard work and determination of the men who built the transcontinental railroad.Gift of Weston J. and Mary M. Naef
Today's high-speed trains travel at almost two hundred miles an hour, so it is hard for twenty-first century passengers to imagine the fear induced by the speed of trains in the 1800s. The locomotive in this photograph would have traveled at the bone-jarring speed of about eighteen miles an hour. When trains were first introduced, many people were reluctant to ride on them. Some even believed that they were the work of the devil. The steam, smoke, and sparks emitted from the belly of these monsters caused a great deal of anxiety for timid souls. Eventually people grew accustomed to the invention and happily traveled for days on trains pulled by steam engines like this Central Pacific Railroad locomotive.Gift of Weston J. and Mary M. Naef

In 1862 an Indiana state representative stated that the transcontinental railway  could never be constructed ontermsapplicable to ordinary roads . . . . It is to be constructed through almost impassible mountains, deep ravines, canyons, gorges, and over arid and sandy plains.  Photographers like Alfred A. Hart documented the staggering constructions that, before the railroad, no one had imagined possible. Blasting through a naturally cemented part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, crews of the Central Pacific Railroad built this immense corridor, sixty-three feet deep and eight hundred feet long.Though Hart made thisstereograph, itsmountbears Carleton E.

The construction of the transcontinental railroad required overcoming political, financial, and geological obstacles; significantly, it also shifted the attention of the American public away from the sorrows of the Civil War to the promise of westward expansion. This photograph displays the crowd of workers and dignitaries gathered in Utah to commemorate and celebrate its completion. To properly mark the occasion, the last spike tying the rails was made of solid gold.Gift of Weston J. and Mary M. Naef
With noble bearing, this man proudly holds his chin high above his powerful chest. Sculptor Francis Harwood chose a black stone to reproduce the sitter's skin tone. Harwood also chose an unusualantiqueformat for thebust, terminating it in a wide arc below the man's pectoral muscles. Harwood was familiar with antique sculptures from time spent in Florence reproducing and copying them. He may have deliberately used this elegant, rounded termination, which includes the entire, unclothed chest and shoulders, to evoke associations with ancient busts of notable men. Although the identity of the sitter is unknown, the scar on his face suggests that this is a portrait of a specific individual. This work may be one of the earliest sculpted portraits of a Black individual by a European.
This enormous photographic collage depicts an octopus-like creature made up of dozens of human body parts, floating in a cosmic atmosphere. To form this fantastical illusion, Tim Hawkinson cut and assembled close-up photographs of his hands and lips with jigsaw-like precision. Thin white outlines created by razor-sharp cuts in the photographs draw attention to a tactile, hand crafted approach. The palm of the artist's hand faces out, with extra fingers added to denote the sea creature's eight limbs. Puckered lips, sometimes with tongue and or gums showing, represent suction-cup like suckers typically associated with an octopus' anatomy. They radiate from a central point on the mollusk's underbelly, growing or shrinking in size to suggest shape and movement. What appear to be leftover cutouts encircling the lips are scattered across a dark  sky,  evoking new moons and planetary eclipses.Octopusis one of four objects commissioned by the Getty Museum in 2006 for inclusion in the exhibition, Zoopsia: New Works by Tim Hawkinson.
Turned ivories, or ivory objects worked on alatheto create varying geometric forms, were popular among European princely collectors in the 1600s. The sense of precarious balance caused by carving the cup so that its components seem to spin around a shifting vertical axis would have been a source of amusement for these aristocrats. The chubby, nude infants that play musical instruments around the body and on the stem of the vessel and the cherub with his bow and arrow on the top were probably added later in the century.This stemmed cup was made as a work of art to amaze and astonish and was never actually used. Only highly skilled craftsmen could produce such fragile, intricate forms, and much ivory, an extremely costly and rare material, must have been wasted before a perfect vessel was produced. So valued were these ivory objects that on at least one occasion in the 1630s, a German collection of them was seized as war booty by the invading Catholic army and carried off to Florence as the victor's reward.
In a shadowy boudoir scene with a theatrically parted canopy,Venuscombs her hair before a mirror held byCupid. Rather than detailing her facial features, Joseph Heintz the Elder focused attention on the goddess's unusual pose, displaying her elongated back in an extended curve, slightly twisted in theManneristfashion.Employing a distinctive use of chalk, Heintz recalled the works of Michelangelo in his refined modeling of nudes in smoothly modulated chalks. During two trips to Italy, the Swiss artist had assimilated a variety of Italian drawing techniques. He probably made this sketch during his second voyage south in 1592. His employer, the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, had sent Heintz there to sketch antiquities and to acquire works of art for the imperial collection.
Dirk Helmbreker may have begun by sketching the partially crossed out figure on the verso, which is closely related to the smoker on the recto. First, he sketched a seated man lighting a pipe from a bowl, then changed the head's position to lean forward. Finally, with moistened red chalk, he overlaid the second head with a rather abstract third one that leans even farther toward the bowl, similar to the smoker's pose on the recto. On the more finished recto, Helmbreker caught the fleeting actions of two youths, a smoker seemingly standing and sucking in his breath to light a pipe and a boy seated behind a table and leaning back to drink from a jug. The drinker's sidelong glance enhances the scene's spontaneous, lifelike feeling. Someone may have trimmed the sheet, reducing these figures from three-quarter-length to the present half-length.
With the determined, confident air of an officer accustomed to giving orders, this young man was typical of the wealthy admirals, military heroes, and members of the regent class who patronized Bartholomeus van der Helst, the most popular portrait painter among Amsterdam's leading citizens. They sought him out for his elegant, almost glamorous manner, inspired by the art of Anthony van Dyck, and for his scrupulous attention to their expensive costume.In characteristic fashion, van der Helst devoted extensive attention to the raised ornament of this somber soldier's costume, brilliantly depicting the gold and silver brocade and scattering reflection throughout the whole picture. In his concern with realistic effects, the artist also attended to the varied details of other surfaces, from the soft doeskin of the soldier's glove to the tassels hanging from his stiff collar.
About nine feet tall, this hollowed-out bronze sculpture is a commanding presence. It is not recognizable as a specific human form, but the narrowing shape suggests the contours of a head and body. Although the piece can be viewed from all sides, the carved surface is richer and more textured from the front than from the back. The sculpture's shrouded or veiled appearance and dark, almost leathery surfaces, create a slightly foreboding quality.Barbara Hepworth often pierced or punctured her forms, creating a play of positive and negative space. Here, the four openings accentuate the sculpture's relation to the surrounding landscape--an interplay reinforced by the work's title.To create this sculpture, Hepworth began with an aluminum armature. Layer upon layer of plaster was piled onto this sturdy structure. When the plaster dried, Hepworth then directly carved into the hard surface, working and reworking it until she reached a final form. The form was then cast in bronze in two parts. Hepworth preferred working in the open air to ensure that when installed out-of-doors, her sculptures would respond to the light in precisely the way she intended.
This is not a static scene, despite the fact that the main subjects in it are simply waiting for the bus. The picture is filled with tension--of a visual kind. A newspaper vending machine and a man in a hat anchor the image's two lower corners, as diagonal lines forming the sidewalk's edges shoot out from them and meet in the distance. Elements that are either moving or at a diagonal angle to the horizon seem especially pronounced in relation to subjects that are visually still--like the man sitting on a bench with his legs andarmscrossed as he eyes the photographer.This photograph is part of Anthony Hernandez's series,Public Transit Areas(1979-80), which focused on people waiting at bus stops in Los Angeles. The invasive, sensory elements of the city vie for attention with vulnerable looking individuals immersed in their own private worlds. Hernandez used relatively large photographic equipment--a five-by-seven-inch camera mounted on a tripod--to achieve sharp focus throughout his images. A consistent, formulaic approach tocompositionalso heightens the visual tension. By centering his human subjects in the frame, the street's one-pointperspectiveas it recedes into the distance is emphasized.Backgrounddetails compete for attention because their specifics change from image to image, even as the placement of basic elements remains fixed.
It is not an accident that vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines converge at a central point in this photograph, because Anthony Hernandez is deliberately playing with a visual clich. In this picture thevanishing pointis located to one side of a woman's head as she stands waiting for the bus, gazing rather impatiently in the direction from which it might arrive. A visual tension is created between the compositional diagonals, a vertical pole in theforeground, and the woman standing next to it. One can't help but notice the crisp details that surround her, like the signage of at least three banks.This photograph is part of Anthony Hernandez's series,Public Transit Areas(1979-80), which focused on people waiting at bus stops in Los Angeles.

Elaborately decorated with multi-colored panels of landscape scenes, this ewer and basin combine influences from a variety of sources. The ewer's helmet shape copies a metalwork form, while the flowers decorating the stem and handle derive from Japanese ceramics.The painted scenes are attributed to Christian Friedrich Herold, who began working at the Meissen Porcelain Manufactory in 1726. He became a prominent painter there, specializing in landscapes. Both the ewer and basin are decorated with landscape and harbor scenes containing figures in contemporary European dress.
A band of stylized birds, generally referred to as herons, decorates the underside of thisEtruscanplate. The greatly elongated, silhouetted bodies of the birds completely fill the space. The small pair of holes just below the rim is a frequent feature of Etruscan plates in this period; they may have been used to hang the vessels when not in use.The plate's shape appears to be an adaptation ofPhoenicianplates, also decorated with concentric circles, that were imported to Italy. The Etruscan potter created a new class of pottery by merging this Phoenician shape with a Greek decorative syntax and an Etruscanmotif. Typical of a style scholars call sub-Geometric, this plate and its mate retained the primarily linear decoration of the earlierGeometricperiod at a time when other artists were producing works in the new Orientalizing style.

On this preserved section of recomposed fragments of a large drinking cup-or skyphos--a man balances himself on his right foot as he lifts his left leg and drinks from a large white cup. Individual figures in amusing poses were often used to decorate red-figured drinking cups destined for use in the symposion. But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it. It features white, red, and orange designs painted atop of a black-gloss ground, and often includes delicately incised silhouette. The technique was invented around the same time as thered-figure technique, in approximately 525 B.C.  Both feature a light-on-dark appearance that contrasts with the dark-on-light effect of the olderblack-figure technique.
In 1821 Sir John Herschel made agrand tourof Europe, recording his observations of geographical and geological formations with the aid of a drawing tool called thecamera lucida. He looked at nature through thisdevice, drawing with his pencil in close-valued shades of graphite gray that anticipated photographs incompositionandtonalscale. Herschel rendered the mountains near Geneva, Switzerland, with the same attention to detail that he concentrated on a tree in theforeground. By so doing, he achieved a uniform field of focus that is closer to photographic vision than it is to the selective focus of the unaided eye.
Two young sisters share a moment of unguarded reflection and warmth. Wearing a serious expression, the older sister protectively holds her younger sister. She, in turn, leans into the older girl's encircling arms. Modeled by sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand, who made his primary reputation producing official portraits, thisterracottais an intimate and sensitive double portrait of his daughters Silvia, age four, and Bertel, age three.Although he gave the faces the most detail, Hildebrand also included much of the torsos in thebustto express physically the sisters' affectionate relationship. Using a format derived from Florentine busts of the 1400s, he terminated their torsos with a strong horizontal line and included a lowplinthon which the older girl rests her arm. Like the earlier Italian busts, this one was painted with coloredpigments. EarlyRenaissanceart was particularly influential for Hildebrand, who divided his time between working in Munich and Florence.
The team of Hill and Adamson initially began making dramatic portrait photographs as studies for one of Hill's composite paintings. They also produced costume studies, including this scene in which Arabic scholar Mr. Lane and Mr. (Peddie) Redding appear in foreign garb.
David Hill and Robert Adamson posed the Reverend Dr. Abraham Capadose in a seated position, grasping a large Bible. Capadose, a physician and a Calvinist writer from The Hague, in the Netherlands, joined the Free Church of Scotland. Its supporters came from all over the world. Hill probably used this print as the basis of the minister's portrait in his painting,The Disruption Picture, where Capadose appears at the extreme right.
David Hill and Robert Adamson frequently exercised artistic license in their photographs. Faint traces of a headrest, an apparatus used to restrict a sitter's movement, indicate that the negative was changed to mask this tool. They also altered the original negative for this image to include a specific reference to the Rev. James Julius Wood's position: the titleScotch Church Malta 1843drawn in ink on the book he holds. Wood was chaplain to the 42nd Gordon Highlanders, a group of soldiers stationed on the Mediterranean island of Malta.Hill used thiscalotypeas the basis for Wood's portrait inThe Disruption Picture, even though the minister may not have been present at the signing ceremony. The adjustments suggest that Hill and Adamson did not view their photographs as mere preparatory sketches but rather as independent works of art.
The fisherman James Linton leans against a boat in a casual position. Unable to show him at sea, David Hill and Robert Adamson skillfully surrounded Linton with the attributes of his job, in much the same way they employed books in their portraits of ministers.Hill and Adamson made a series of acclaimed portraits featuring the men, women, and children of the small fishing village of Newhaven, one mile north of Edinburgh. Arguably the first examples of social documentary photographs ever made, these approximately 130 images dealt with everyday life. The natural appearance of the people suggests that Hill and Adamson earned the trust and cooperation of the fisherfolk.
Having learned to make photographs directly from William Henry Fox Talbot, the inventor of thecalotypeprocess, the eminent scientist Sir David Brewster brought photography to Scotland in the early 1840s, making the country one of the early experimental centers for the new art. In a July 3, 1843, letter to Talbot, Brewster wrote:I got hold of the artist[David Octavius Hill]--showed him the Calotype, & the eminent advantage he might derive from it in getting likenesses of all the principal characters before they were dispersed to their respective homes. He was at first incredulous, but went to Mr.[Robert]Adamson, and arranged with him preliminaries for getting all the necessary portraits.Seeing the opportunity for photography to assist in the process of making preliminary studies for painting, Brewster introduced Hill to Adamson, who had recently opened a photographic studio in Edinburgh. Brewster himself was a member of the newly formed Free Church of Scotland. Using this calotype as a model, Hill included Brewster's portrait inThe Disruption Picture.
David Hill and Robert Adamson often photographed Elizabeth Rigby, later Lady Eastlake, along with her mother and sister while the three women were living in Edinburgh. In 1849 Elizabeth married Sir Charles Eastlake, president of the Royal Academy, Director of the National Gallery, and first President of the Royal Photographic Society. She became an author and critic, and in 1857 she published a groundbreaking article,  Photography,  one of the first histories of the medium that also championed photography as a fine art. Eastlake wrote:  It is now more than fifteen years ago that specimens of a new and mysterious art were first exhibited to our wondering gaze...we examined them with the keenest admiration, and felt that the spirit of Rembrandt had revived. Lady Eastlake is shown here seated in a doorway, which provides a frame for the contrast between the darkness inside and the outdoor light into which the sitter faces. Her eyes are cast downward and appear almost melancholy, but the lyrical gesture may not have a poetic intent. Eastlake probably averted her eyes from the camera because the exposure time for the photograph would have been up to thirty seconds, too long for her eyes to remain focused.
The traces of headrests faintly visible in the background indicate that these fisherwomen--Marion Finlay, Margaret Dryburgh Lyall, and Grace Finlay Ramsay--were carefully posed for this print. The theme of the letter, which is the object of the women's attention, harks back togenrepaintings of the 1600s.The existence of a few variants of this print indicates that David Hill and Robert Adamson experimented with the subject on a number of occasions. Scholars now speculate that the picture was made at their studio at Rock House, on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, and not in the fishing village of Newhaven, as had been believed. The photographers succeeded, however, in presenting a humble scene from everyday life in a seemingly genuine portrayal.
Even though the subjects had to remain completely motionless for the length of time it took to make an exposure, David Hill and Robert Adamson achieved a sense of apparent spontaneity by skillful positioning of the camera. This image is remarkable for capturing as many as sixteen individuals. The group looks away from the camera, since the photograph was intended as a study for Hill's large paintingThe Disruption Picture,in which the ministers focused their gaze on the signing ceremony depicted at the center of the canvas.
Described as  one of the greatest presidents the institution has ever had,  the Reverend Dr. James McCosh became the eleventh president of the College of New Jersey, later named Princeton University. Prior to immigrating to America in 1868, McCosh was a professor of logic and moral philosophy at Queens College, Belfast. He was also a leading Free Church of Scotland minister; David Hill and Robert Adamson photographed him in this role for Hill's painting,The Disruption Picture.
Reverend Dr. John Reid Omond poses with his hand to his temple while leaning upon a book, suggesting the transference of knowledge from page to brain and also implying the significant weight of his intellect. Such attention to the subject's head and hands arguably had its roots in portrait painting of the 1700s. As secretary to the Royal Scottish Academy of Art, David Hill was familiar with Scotland's rich artistic tradition. He made this print in preparation for his paintingThe Disruption Picture,dealing with Scotland's dramatic religious event of 1843.
This full-length portrait of Reverend Dr. Thomas Guthrie was somewhat unusual for David Hill and Robert Adamson, who generally favored seated positions. In this example the minister stands beside a chair, against a dark tarpaulin backdrop that masks the stone wall behind it. Hill and Adamson's studio was located in the backyard of their Calton Hill residence in Edinburgh. The outdoors location was essential, as thecalotypeprocess required direct sunlight to expose the negative.The photographers made this portrait in preparation for Hill's painting,The Disruption Picture,commemorating Scotland's dramatic religious event of 1843.
Coming from the Highlands of Scotland, the Reverend Dr. John Macdonald was known as  The Apostle of the North.  He was very much involved with the Free Church of Scotland during the 1840s; David Hill and Robert Adamson photographed him in preparation for the portrait that appears in the central section of Hill's painting,The Disruption Picture. The strongchiaroscuropresent in many of their photographs, as seen here, caused viewers in the 1800s to compare them to etchings by Rembrandt.
In his paintingThe Disruption Picture,David Hill wanted to reflect the egalitarianism that was at the very core of the Free Church of Scotland. If he adhered to the precepts of historical painting, however, the image would be composed of a hierarchy of elements, with the important figures positioned in the center and the less important individuals towards the outside. He was therefore committed to the idea of conveying each minister the same way. Group photographs such as these mounted together on an album page allowed Hill to study the spatial arrangement of initially separate figures.

Described by a fellow member of the clergy as  the Church's trusted leader--the powerful and unflinching champion of its independence,  the Reverend Dr. Thomas Chalmers became the first moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland after the Disruption. Chalmers was a popular subject for David Hill and Robert Adamson.This photograph showing the minister gesticulating is an early example of Hill's use of photography as a sketching tool to aid him in arranging the various elements of his painting,The Disruption Picture. Hill had originally planned to depict Chalmers, shown here at the central pulpit, as more of a predominant figure in the painting.
In spite of being a fledgling institution, the Free Church of Scotland had a considerable number of missionaries who wanted to bring the democratic church teachings to a world audience. Dhanjiobai Nauroji was a Parsi convert who was ordained a minister in the Free Church of Scotland in 1846. Seated across the table from him is the Reverend John Jaffray, Secretary of the Free Church Board of Missions. David Hill used the figure of Nauroji in his painting,The Disruption Picture.
In the numerous portraits made by David Hill and Robert Adamson, Hill himself was by far the most popular subject. He appeared in more than fortycalotypes, often as part of a group arrangement. Photography provided him with the opportunity to quickly explore new positioning and lighting; placing himself in front of the camera made these experiments even easier. In this image he stands against the doorway of Rock House, perfectly at ease and well-composed. I know not the process though it is done under my nose continually and I believe I never will,  wrote painter David Octavius Hill of the photographic medium. Hill clearly saw his role in the partnership as providing artistic direction. Robert Adamson, concerned more with photography's chemical and technical aspects, occupied a behind-the-scenes role and, as a result, appeared in very few photographs.
In addition to portraits, David Hill and Robert Adamson made a number of architectural studies, such as this large photograph. They focused their attention not on the steeple church of Tollbooth Saint John's but on the structure undergoing construction directly below, the General Assembly Hall for the newly formed Free Church of Scotland. As a metaphor for the religious dispute in Scotland, the building stands for the new church sprouting up from under the towering presence of the existing church.
Photography made but slow way in England; and the first knowledge to many even of her existence came back to us from across the Border. It was in Edinburgh where the first earnest, professional practice of the art began, and thecalotypesof Messrs. Hill and Adamson remain to this day the most picturesque specimens of the new discovery.So wrote Elizabeth Rigby of the photographers in 1857. Rigby became a popular sitter for David Hill and Robert Adamson, appearing in more than twenty of their calotypes. In this image she seems lost in thought. Although leaning forward, she does not engage the viewer. The commonmotifof books alludes to her intellectual abilities.Rigby lived in Edinburgh during the 1840s, where she was welcomed into distinguished literary and social circles. Critical of the disruption within the Church of Scotland, she described how she left one of its assemblies  thoroughly disgusted  over the  horrible display of vulgarities.  Upon marrying Sir Charles Eastlake in 1849, she assumed the title Lady Eastlake but retained her connection to photography since he became the first president of theRoyal Photographic Societyin London in 1853.
In the summer of 1845, David Hill and Robert Adamson went to the fishing village of Newhaven near Edinburgh to photograph the residents, an unprecedented effort in outdoor and group photography. Most photographs of this time, especially portraits, were commissioned.The informal assembly of men not consciously posing for the camera predates the development of the snapshot photograph. Of the eleven men pictured here, it is likely that not one of them had even seen a photograph before. Hill and Adamson carefully delineated each of them; their overlapping postures manage not to obscure a single head. The men stand casually; only a few of them even look in the camera's direction, as if they are completely unaware of what the two men fussing with chemicals and huddled behind the strange box have come to do.
Born near Lake Ontario in Canada, Reverend Peter Jones was of Welsh and Ojibway Indian ancestry. Growing up within the tribe he received the name Kahkewaquonaby, meaning  Sacred Waving Eagle's Plume.  Baptized in the Methodist Church as a teenager, he later became a missionary to the Indians.In July 1845 Jones preached in Edinburgh. Hill and Adamson made severalcalotypesof him on August 4. In some of the pictures he wears Indian garments, as seen here; in others he appears in Western clothes. These images are among the oldest surviving photographs of a North American Indian.
In addition to portraits, David Hill and Robert Adamson also made numerous tableaux vivant. In this photograph, the sculptor John Henning appears as Edie Ochiltree, a fictional character from Sir Walter Scott's novelThe Antiquary. With staff and badge indicating his beggar status, the white-haired Henning closely resembles the figure of Ochiltree as Scott described him.
 I found six Cheyennes who had just left the war path, all strappen big fellows. I took them among the rocks and set them up as food for my camera,  wrote John K. Hillers in a May 1875 letter to his brother. At that time, Hillers was in Oklahoma photographing scenes of life in what was then called the Eastern Indian Territory. He made this portrait of Little Bear, a proud Cheyenne warrior seated holding a long pipe, the day after his arrival in the area.Hillers went to Indian Territory under the direction of John Wesley Powell, an expedition leader with whom he had worked for four years. Powell, who conducted his surveys under the direction of the Department of the Interior, used Hillers's photographs to gain Congressional support for further expeditions. The images brought public recognition to both men when they appeared in the Powell Survey exhibit at Philadelphia's 1876 Centennial Exhibition, a world's fair attended by over ten million visitors.
To signify their unmarried status, these two Moki, or Hopi, women wear tightly wrapped  butterfly  or  ram's horns  hairstyles and cornmeal dust on their faces. As part of an ethnographic survey team headed by John Wesley Powell, John K. Hillers documented such variations in costume and facial adornment among the people of the mesas near the Grand Canyon. He photographed these women amid a variety of Hopi weavings, part of the tribe's material culture that would also have interested the survey team. Various members of the team took notes, collected artifacts, and photographed the Indians of the New Mexico and Arizona territories for the research files of the Smithsonian Institution.
The newsboy's wary expression suggests someone unused to being regarded as worthy subject matter for a photographer's lens. The size of the newspapers, measuring from his underarm to below his knee, gives a graphic indication of the physical inequality between this worker and the requirements of his labor. The shadows of the photographer, his camera, and the lampposts visually isolate the figure of the boy. This framing and the inclusion of a self-portrait suggest Hine's empathetic nature toward his subject matter. Of his emphasis on the human condition in his images, Hine wrote:  ...one [misconception] is that our material assets 'just happen' as the product of a bunch of impersonal machines... the human spirit is the big thing, after all....  Lewis Hine's photographs of children in deplorable working conditions were instrumental in the passage of child labor laws in the United States.
A young girl of no more than twelve or thirteen years of age stands poised between a window and a cotton loom that seems to extend infinitely into the distance behind her. Almost metaphorically, her hair appears to be cropped short on the side that faces the loom, while a long braided ponytail faces the window as if its growth has been nourished by the sunlight. Her own cotton dress is wrinkled and shabby, the soft, faded stripes of her garment contrasting with the tautly pulled threads running through the machine at which she labors.Lewis Hine's photographs of poor children in deplorable working conditions, made while on assignment from the National Child Labor Committee, were instrumental in the passage of child labor laws in the United States.
Tony Casale, an eleven-year-old newsboy in Hartford, Connecticut, faces the camera in the straightforward manner of Lewis Hine's portraits of child laborers. Hine's subjects often appear front and center, surrounded by machinery or the products of their toil. Casale, who often worked until ten at night, appears isolated, his future as bleak as the wall behind him.Hine and other progressive social reformers were concerned about the fate of children who dropped out of school to enter the work force. Working for the National Child Labor Committee, Hine made thousands of pictures of children at work--in Southern mills, glass factories, fish canneries, tenements, and fields. He recorded their names, their heights, the hours they worked, the money they spent, and such descriptive details as  out past midnight  or  smokes cigars.  Hine was one of the first photographers to document the exploitation of child labor, a product of rapid industrialization and urbanization at the beginning of the 1900s.
A young girl wearing a worn dress stands beside a cotton loom in the factory where she works. For this image, photographer Lewis Hine chose a vantage point that emphasizes the enormity of the child's environment. A series of tall windows on the right illuminate the large spinning machine that recedes into the distance and dominates the room, dwarfing the figure. Hine was known to enter factories and warehouses under false pretenses to make photographs of child laborers. He would hide a pad and pencil in his pockets to note the names and heights of his subjects. Sadie Pfeiffer, pictured here, was forty-eight inches tall when Hine captured this image. Introducing middle-class America to the ugly truth about children's working conditions, Hine's photographs, made while on assignment from the National Child Labor Committee, were instrumental in the passage of child labor laws in the United States.
Gracie Clark, the tense looking girl in the white dress, posed for Lewis Hine with her parents and four younger siblings. As a photographer particularly interested in documenting the ills of child labor, Hine perhaps only incidentally created a family portrait. Gracie and her younger sister, far right, worked as spinners in a local mill. Their clean clothes set them apart from the rest of the family, emphasizing their role as industrial workers.Hine was known to sneak into factories and warehouses under false pretenses to make photographs of child laborers in as realistic settings as possible. He would hide pad and pencil in his pockets to note the names and heights of his subjects. As one historian noted,  Hine was a firm believer in the power of knowledge to vanquish evil.  Introducing middle-class America to the ugly truth about children's working conditions, Hine's  photographs were a powerful tool in social reformers' efforts to fight child labor.
In 1907 the United States Congress mandated that the National Child Labor Committee investigate child labor. Hired to gather evidence, Hine, a sociologist, created more than five thousand negatives within a period of ten years. The neutral quality of his images made them reliable documents. They were reproduced in educational campaigns that led to protective legislation for children in the U.S. Hine denounced the use of children in the workforce by focusing on details that show the inequities of their position. This newsboy appears threatened by every element that surrounds him in the scene, such as the shadows--which include one of the photographer himself--and the poster advertisement that is larger than he is.
Oltos was an important vase painter specializing in the decoration of bilingual andred-figurecups. He painted both theblack-figureand the red-figure decoration of his bilinguals. Like most of his late bilingual eye-cups, this black-figure tondo bears the inscription,  Memnon is beautiful. The figure painted in the tondo has no distinguishing attributes to aid identification. He is nude, except for a mantle thrown over his left shoulder and right arm. Touches of added red, an old-fashionedmotifused in black-figure and characteristic of Oltos, embellish alternate folds of the mantle, as well as sections of the man's hair and beard. Like the figure in the tondo, the red-figured youth on the exterior of the cup is anonymous, in his case entirely nude except for a purplish added-red wreath around his head.Bilingual vases were developed as a style of vase decoration in Athens around 525 B.C. They combine the two traditional Athenian vase-decoration techniques: the older technique of black-figure, and red-figure, the technique that would gain popularity and continue to be used through the fourth century B.C. On a black-figure vase, silhouettes in black gloss are contrasted against the red-orange clay of the vessel. On a red-figure vase, the forms come from the red-orange color of the clay, and the space around them is filled in with black gloss. Like most bilingual cups, this is an eye-cup, with large eyes painted on the red-figured exterior and a single black figure on the tondo of the interior. Red-figuredpalmettesappear at the handles, and a single red figure occupies the space between the large eyes on one side.
A close look at this wooded landscape reveals two paths--one bathed in sunlight on the left, and one elevated and overcast in shadow on the right--occupied by a wide assortment of figures. Playful dogs, lumbering farm animals, and travelers on foot and horseback all crowd the meandering roads, lined with rosy brick cottages and gray wood barns. Powerful oak trees dominate the composition, casting the foreground into shadow, while a sun-drenched clearing in the distance draws the viewer into the scene.In addition to the winding roads and animated figures, artist Meindert Hobbema, used thick applications of paint in combination with thin delineating brushstrokes to create a sense of energy and motion throughout the landscape. The lively, inventive view of nature and brooding palette of deep browns and grays in this painting are characteristic of Hobbema's landscapes; however, few of them are as cleverly organized and grandly executed as this wooded view.
In theforeground, a dog laps eagerly at a pool of water while a duck dives for food. To the left, a horseman and three travelers on foot walk up the bank to a road. In themiddle ground, a lone man fishes in a shallow pool that leads back to a brightlyilluminatedvillage. Sketchily painted clouds fill the sky above; sunlight filters through the grove of trees below, lighting areas of the forest and casting reflections in the water. Meindert Hobbema captured both the tranquility and transience of the natural world by masterfully rendering the effects of light and shade, smooth water, billowing clouds, and soaring birds.
Although the Venetians tried to protect their monopoly of colorlesscristalloglass, issuing orders and threatening terrible punishments to workers who emigrated to the north, its manufacture spread to many parts of Europe in the 1500s. In 1534, in Hall, Austria,Emperor Ferdinand Iopened one of the earliestglasshousesto produce Venetian-style glass in Northern Europe. Wolfgang Vitl ran the workshop, employing both Venetian glassblowers and local craftsmen.Vitl and his successor Sebastian Hchstetter produced vessels that areItalianatein shape but larger and sturdier than genuine Venetian products. Venetian vessels from half a century earlier influenced this goblet's form, but its pattern-moldedknopis typical of mid-sixteenth-century glass from Hall.

This goblet's flat foot and hollow stem imitate vessels produced in Murano fifty years earlier. But its body, molded in a pattern of drop-shaped protrusions painted in gold, white, and green, depends more on Germanic influences. Only traces of the paint remain, making it now impossible to guess the original design in gold or even to know how much of the goblet was covered.
Newly arrived guests toasted and drank from thisWilkommglasor welcome glass. The beaker's sides and foot also served as a kind of guest book where distinguished visitors inscribed their names, personaldevices, and dates of their visit. Such important individuals included Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol and his nephew Maximilian I, members of important families from the Austrian Tyrol, and a formidable soldier known as the  terrorizer of the Turks. As most of the inscriptions date from 1559 to 1629, this is one of the earliest welcome glasses to survive. The enameledcoat of armson both sides of the beaker must date before 1555, when it was redesigned to incorporate the inherited arms of another family. As they were used for toasts in drunken celebrations that could last for nearly three weeks, many such glasses ended up broken and ultimately discarded.
The goblet's decorativetrailedglass bands delineate measures for a drinking game. The drinker was supposed to gulp only enough to reach the next horizontal line on the goblet and then pass the glass to the next person, giving the vessel its name:Passglasor  pass glass.  If he drank too much, he was required to reach the next mark, and so on.This goblet combines the elongated proportions of Venetian style glasses with other elements closer to Germanic taste: the vessel's large volume, trailed glass, andraspberry prunts. From the early part of the 1500s, great numbers of Italian glassmakers traveled to Northern Europe and began working there, producing objects that combined Venetian techniques with local innovations. Theglasshouseat Hall, established in the 1530s, where this goblet was made, was one of the first glass manufactories in northern Europe to producefaon de Veniseproducts.
'Pearblossom Highway' shows a crossroads in a very wide open space, which you only get a sense of in the western United States. . . . [The] picture was not just about a crossroads, but about us driving around. I'd had three days of driving and being the passenger. The driver and the passenger see the road in different ways. When you drive you read all the road signs, but when you're the passenger, you don't, you can decide to look where you want. And the picture dealt with that: on the right-hand side of the road it's as if you're the driver, reading traffic signs to tell you what to do and so on, and on the left-hand side it's as if you're a passenger going along the road more slowly, looking all around. So the picture is about driving without the car being in it.Thus David Hockney described the circumstances leading to the creation of this photocollage of the scenic Pearblossom Highway north of Los Angeles. His detailed collage reveals the more mundane observations of a road trip. The littered cans and bottles and the meandering line where the pavement ends and the sand begins point to the interruption of the desert landscape by the roads cutting through it and the imprint of careless travelers.
Most photographers think that the rules of perspective are built into the very nature of photography, that it is not possible to change it at all. For me, it was a long process realizing that this does not have to be the case.When making his two photocollages of Pearblossom Highway, David Hockney positioned himself closer to or more distant from his subjects, choosing which elements in the scene should be large and which should be small. By reassembling views from multiple perspectives, he applied ideas borrowed from Cubist painting to produce a rich, compound image that he considers  a panoramic assault on Renaissance one-point perspective. Hockney made this work as a preparatory study for the final version,Pearblossom Hwy., 11 -  18th April 1986, #2,which measures approximately six-and-a-half by nine feet. Aside from scale, the principal differences between the two versions are the distortion of the stop sign in the foreground and the left and right edges of the composition.
In the 1500s, as printing became the most common method of producing books, intellectuals increasingly valued the inventiveness of scribes and the aesthetic qualities of writing. From 1561 to 1562, Georg Bocskay, the Croatian-born court secretary to the Holy RomanEmperor Ferdinand I, created thisModel Book of Calligraphyin Vienna to demonstrate his technical mastery of the immense range of writing styles known to him.About thirty years later, Emperor Rudolph II, Ferdinand's grandson, commissioned Joris Hoefnagel to illuminate Bocskay's model book.  Hoefnagel added fruit, flowers, and insects to nearly every page, composing them so as to enhance the unity and balance of the page's design. It was one of the most unusual collaborations between scribe and painter in the history ofmanuscriptillumination.Because of Hoefnagel's interest in painting objects of nature, his detailed images complement Rudolph II's celebratedKunstkammer,a cabinet of curiosities that contained bones, shells, fossils, and other natural specimens. Hoefnagel's careful images of nature also influenced the development of Netherlandish still life painting.In addition to his fruit and flower illuminations, Hoefnagel added to theModel Booka section on constructing the letters of the alphabet in upper- and lowercase.
Georg Bocskay, one of the greatest scribes of the 1500s, included a variety of texts in different languages in hisModel Book of Calligraphy.The texts are incidental to the calligraphy, which is conceived for its beauty and originality and as a display of virtuosity. On this page Bocskay presented a Latin prayer, beginningDeus(God), employing an elaborate angular script, gold filler for the last line, and ornate flourishes above and below the text.Thirty years later, when illuminator Joris Hoefnagel painted the blank space left at the bottom of the page, he carefully coordinated his image with the script already on the page. Hoefnagel painted a pear, caterpillar, centipede, and hover fly in colors that harmonize with those of the text. The contrast between the yellow and ochre of the moth, hover fly, and pear and the black of the caterpillar echoes the contrast between the gold used for the initial and the decorative filler and the black ink used for the majority of the text. The hover fly was inspired by Bocskay's lower flourishes, which suggest the trajectory of a fly.
On this page, Hoefnagel echoed the swirling lines of calligraphy with the curved, stocky body of a terrestrial mollusk; likewise, the rounded sections of the orange in the center resemble the twisting loops created by the calligrapher. The graceful petals and delicate lavender color of the larkspur blooms to the right, meanwhile, balance the more robust forms of the marine animal and piece of fruit. One of the illumination's most charming details is the almost mischievous look the mollusk seems to direct outward to the viewer.
On this page, illuminator Joris Hoefnagel composed his image in response to the design of calligrapher Georg Bocskay's words. Hoefnagel echoed the curling lines of Bocskay's script with the petals of the flower known as a Maltese cross. Hoefnagel's most audacious response to Bocskay appears in the center of the page. To preserve Bocskay's calligraphic flourish, Hoefnagel painted the flower so as to suggest that the stem pierced the page. The illuminator, who can create an illusion of three-dimensionality, asserted the virtuosity of his art in contrast to that of the calligrapher, whose lines never disturb the two-dimensionality of the page.Hoefnagel painted his objects with a microscopic detail that invites the viewer to look closely at these rare and exotic items, but his illustrations were not always strictly accurate. The small ladybird insect here, for example, is represented with eight legs rather than six.
On turning the page, the viewer sees the paint and ink of the preceding page through the parchment, creating a subdued image of the script, flower, ladybird, and mussel in reverse. But in the middle of this page, the stem from the flower, called a Maltese cross, which illusionistically pierced the other side of the page, here appears to rest above a narrow strip of the parchment. The shadow of this strip of parchment and the flower stem are the only elements that are painted on this side of the page. Through this defiant gesture, Joris Hoefnagel, the brilliantly inventive illuminator, continued his response to the work of master calligrapher Georg Bocskay from the previous page, dramatizing the ability of artists to create visual illusions.Although sixteenth-century manuscripts frequently included fruit and flower borders and employedtrompe-l'oeildevices, never before had the conceit of the pierced page been carried so far.
By contrasting the geometric symmetry of the dragonfly laid out in the center of the page with the more curvilinear, asymmetrical shapes of the pear and carnation below, Joris Hoefnagel created a sense of balance in this illumination. From the diaphanous quality of its intricately patterned wings to the textures of its hard, glossy body and delicate, feathery legs, he based the dragonfly's form on careful observation of nature. While the dragonfly appears to be laid out like a stiff scientific specimen, Hoefnagel imbued the imaginary insect on the right with life and movement as it gently alights on the carnation. The pear, with its fuzzy skin suggested by the use of tiny brushstrokes, casts a shadow, creating the illusion of a real pear placed on the page.
Beneath a canopied structure, a wiry-haired animal, perhaps a sloth, munches on a twig. A Latin text based on Jesus's Sermon on the Mount appears above. Although the text and image seem to fit perfectly together, the different elements on the page were made thirty years apart.The elegant Roman-style lettering was written by Georg Bocskay to display his mastery of calligraphy. The text originally appeared on a plain black background. The illustration was added later by Joris Hoefnagel, who saw in the diminishing script the suggestion of recession into space, an illusion defied by the two-dimensionality of the text. He thus enclosed the letters within an architectural canopy drawn in perspective. Hoefnagel also responded wittily to the black coloration of the page, interpreting it naturalistically as nighttime: the silvery tones of the animal's fur and the gold shimmer in the darkness.
On two grids, Joris Hoefnagel demonstrated the proper form of a capitalE, with the proportions of the letter determined by the relation of its parts to squares and arcs. About thirty years after Georg Bocskay finished hisModel Book of Calligraphy,Hoefnagel added hisGuide to the Construction of Lettersto the manuscript. Hoefnagel'sGuideuses diagrams to demonstrate how geometric principles might be applied to typographical design. The motifs surrounding these diagrams are charged with allegorical and symbolic meaning. At the top of the page, theXPS(Chi-Rho-Sigma) monogram for  Christus  in the azure medallion suggests the dominion of Christ over the world, represented by the maps of the continents on the sides. Echoing this idea, at the bottom of the page Hoefnagel included a verse from Psalm 56:Exaltare super caelos deus et in omnem terram gloria tua(Be exalted above the heavens, God, and your glory through all the earth). The two columns call to mind the so-called Pillars of Hercules, Habsburg imperial symbols since Emperor Charles V had used them in his emblem. The toucan probably does not have a specific symbolic meaning but interested Hoefnagel because of its rarity.
This guide for making the letterQillustrates both the schematic diagram and the finished form of the letter. The artist gave two tails to eachQ, creating symmetrical characters that dominate the decoration of the page. The biblical verses at the center and at bottom praise God and his wonderful deeds. A cherub and trumpets at the top of the page, and vessels of burning incense at the bottom of the page, emphasize these celebratory phrases.
In this example of a letterRfrom Joris Hoefnagel's constructed alphabet, the artist provides both a geometric template and a completed character on the square grids at the center of the page. The letter also introduces the phrase written in gold at the bottom of the page  Rex omnis terrae Deus psallite  (Sing praises to God, King of all the earth), which inspired the inclusion of a singing cherub at center and a pipe organ at bottom. The earth appears twice, presenting both of its hemispheres, with California visible at far left.
On this page, a guide for constructing the lower-case lettersfandg, Joris Hoefnagel took his inspiration for the decorations from the shapes of the letters themselves. Two vertical vases contain slightly bending plant forms, echoing the shape of the letterfand flanking that letter on the top of the page. Two nude caryatids, whose arched backs and protruding stomachs suggest the curved shape of the letterg,flank that letter on the bottom half of the page.The quizzical owls perched on the tops of the vases provide an element of humor. The owl to the left peers at itself in a mirror, whose rounded shape provides a distorted reflection and recalls the German wordEulenspiegel(owlmirror), which means  roguish trick.  Hoefnagel modeled the fantastic mask in the center, with acorns and oak leaves twining around its horns, on a series of contemporary prints.
This guide to the construction of the lower-case lettershandifaces the page containing the lettersfandg. A fanciful mask, whose drooping cheeks recall the frowning mouth of the similarly placed mask on the facing page, dominates the center of the page. A lush cornucopia arises from the top of the mask, and long-necked birds attack from both sides. A furry lap dog beneath an elaborate canopy occupies the lower border, serenely unaware of the scene above. The dog may have symbolic meaning as an embodiment of pure Christian faithfulness.
Seated under a canopy at the lavish banquet she hosts for Marc Antony, Cleopatra holds a glass of wine in which she is about to place a priceless pearl earring as an ostentatious sign of her indifference to wealth. The pearl dissolves in her wine, which she then drinks to Antony's health. In return, he presents her with Cyprus, Phoenicia, Coele-Syria, and parts of Arabia. When Jacques Amyot translated Plutarch'sLife of Marc Antonyin 1559, Europeans rediscovered the legend of the beautiful, brilliant, and powerful Cleopatra; the story was soon reproduced in media such as drama and paintings.Gerard Hoet set this scene from the first century B.C. in a late Baroque interior that he might have seen when he visited Paris in the mid-1670s. Three versions of theBanquet of Cleopatraby Hoet survive, all of which show his emphasis on rich clothing and accessories. His works typify theclassicizingstyle of Dutch academic art; as its foremost proponent, Gerard de Lairesse, wrote,  Away with fumbling, grubbing, and messing: attack your work with a manly hand. But not like Rembrandt ...so that the sap runs down the piece like dung. 
In the late 1400s, northern European artists began to study and draw plants and animals with a greater interest in accuracy. Although showing the uniqueness of each of these specimens was undoubtedly important to Hans Hoffmann, he equally tried to portray the individual beauty of each flower and insect. He placed the peony, two species of irises, an amaryllis, a may beetle, and a june bug in an attractive arrangement on the page. He drew the delicate forms carefully and added lush color in a palette of green, blue, and red. He used plain black chalk to represent the shadow cast by the beetle's body, illusionistically raising the beetle's legs off the ground with this trompe-l'oeil effect.Hoffmann may have intended this arrangement of nature studies to be hung as a painting, since it was listed as such in the archives of its original owner and it remained in a frame until well into the 1800s. Scholars consider this one of the first examples of still life painting.
Nibbling on a leaf pulled from a stalk of Lady's Mantle, an alert hare sits at the edge of a pine forest. Unlike the darkness one would expect to find in a forest, Hans Hoffmann painted a theatrically illuminated scene. Each plant and insect--snail, cricket, beetle--is seen in vivid detail. The finely wrought leaves of the thistle, the sprawling fronds of a plantain, and the bright blue flowers of the Hare Bell attest to Hoffmann's meticulous treatment of the subject. In fact, none of these plants could have co-existed in the natural world. Hoffmann imaginatively combined numerous individual nature studies in a single painting.Hoffmann's golden-brown hare is based on Albrecht Drer's famous and influential watercolor which, much like hisStag Beetle, shows a hare against a plain ground. Hoffmann had seen Drer's hare while in Nuremburg. Later, when he went to work in the court of Emperor Rudolf II, he helped the Emperor acquire the watercolor for hisKunstkammer. Hoffmann's hare differs from Drer's however, appearing amid a striking arrangement of elegant plants and insects. At the time it was painted, this arrangement of nearly life-size subjects was entirely unique, not only within Hoffmann's body of work, but also within the tradition of German nature study.
Thisnarrativepainting describes the moments before a seduction. A young man in red breeches attempts to pull a young woman onto a bed. Struggling, she tries to push him away, dragging her dressing table down with her. Ironically, an open drawer reveals a book on the rules of courtship. Below, a small dog barks, alarmed by the commotion.In theBiographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth,published in 1785, John Nichols wrote that a  certain vicious nobleman,  the Duke of Montague, supposedly commissioned this painting and its companion,After.According to an old tradition, the protagonist was said to have been Sir John Willes, later Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas.Many artists made engravings, some of them scandalous, after these paintings. Hogarth's engravings after his own paintings are truer to the originals.
In this companion piece to theBefore[the Seduction], a man stands and hurriedly pulls up his breeches after successfully seducing a young woman. Cap and clothing askew, the disheveled woman implores his discretion. The overturned table and broken mirror symbolize the woman's shattered life now that she has lost her virginity. The dog sleeping in theforegroundrefers to post-coital exhaustion.In theBiographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth,published in 1785, John Nichols wrote that a  certain vicious nobleman,  the Duke of Montague, supposedly commissioned this painting and its partner. According to an old tradition, the scene's protagonist was said to have been Sir John Willes, later Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas.Many artists created engravings, some of them scandalous, after these two paintings. Hogarth's own engravings stayed truer to his paintings.
An open book, fancy robe, and heavy fur coat suggest that this man, shown kneeling in an abbey, held an elevated status in society. Although his identity is not known, he was probably a member of the abbey's order. A sash cord hangs near the canon's face, drawing attention to his ornate architectural surroundings. A sea god and goddess--symbols of classical learning--celebrate the importance of ancient mythology during the Renaissance. The canon depicted here may have commissioned this glass panel, perhaps inserted in a clear glass window in the abbey, as a form of immortalization.There are no known surviving stained-glass portraits attributed to Hans Holbein the Younger, who, as a young artist active in Switzerland, often designed stained glass. The subject's intense facial features show intellectual acuity, consistent with Holbein's portraits in oil paint.
The painted roundel in the center of this diamond-shaped wood panel features a rider in classical attire on a galloping white horse. A panel of this format usually depicted a coat of arms, but here it was adopted for a personal emblem. The unbridled horse-symbolic of vigor, ambition, or passion-carries a rider whose individualized features suggest it might be a portrait. Below, a cartouche holds the Italian inscriptionE cosi desio me mena(And so desire carries me along) taken from Petrarch'sCanzoniere, written about 1342. The patron who commissioned the panel was probably a scholar and a humanist familiar with this text.TheAllegory of Passionhas a rich history of ownership. On the back of the panel is the monogramHP, which stands for Henry, Prince of Wales, the older brother of Charles I and one of the first serious art collectors in England. Richard Symonds, a British diarist, next mentioned the painting as being seen in the  Closett of the Lady Anne Mary Howard  at Arundel House in London in 1653.
Hans Holbein the Younger first sketched the sitter, whose identity is unknown, with black chalk. Subsequently, he used a brush and ink to describe the hair and collar. He used a pointed quill pen and ink to make the contour lines of the face and details such as the small dots that suggest the stubble of an incipient beard. In this second stage, Holbein made several changes in the outline of the hat and the cloak just behind the sitter's head. He used a soft red chalk over the pink ground of the paper to model the face subtly.Holbein became painter to the court of King Henry VIII of England in 1536. After the artist's death in 1543, numerous drawings of members of the court were found in his studio. This group of drawings, which may have included this portrait, was gathered into the so-called  great booke  and given to Henry VIII.
Is it a honeymoon reverie that has brought this stalwart young couple precariously close to the edge of the falls, posing gamely for the photographer in their waterproof slickers  Taken from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls and showing the spectacular cliff, Henry Hollister's portrait positions its subjects so that they are framed by the brilliant white foamy spray as the falls stream downward in silvery sheets. The man stands in partial shadow behind his companion, his hand placed firmly on her shoulder as if to steady and comfort her. The balled-up left fist lying in her lap suggests that she was not entirely at ease with their vertiginous positioning, but a tentative smile reveals her to be at least a good sport.
In the mid 1800s, most of New York's principal photography studios, including that of Silas A. Holmes, who made this photograph, were located along Broadway in present-day Soho. Art galleries, pharmacists, and specialty stores could also be found along this street. During this period, residents were rapidly moving northward on the island of Manhattan. The traditional four-story houses with ground-floor retail enterprises were being demolished to make room for commercial spaces, such as the prominent six-story St. Nicholas Hotel, the white building at center left.
There is little in this image to indicate that residential neighborhood along New York's Fifth Avenue would become a well-known center of commercial activity. Rows of single-family brownstones with grand front stoops line the wide corridor. While children play on the broad sidewalk and carriages make deliveries, a group of girls stand on the small balcony of the corner house. In the distance, the 1854 steeple of Marble Collegiate Church at 29th Street punctuates the rows of recently built homes and newly planted trees.
A group of schoolboys gathered around the then-new monument of George Washington in Union Square looks directly at Silas A. Holmes's camera. Though this image depicts children, the monument was more frequently a rendezvous point for unemployed actors in the 1850s and 1860s. In the 1870s the area became the heart of the commercial entertainment district and then was graced with a newly landscaped green park. Monument House in thebackground, a home newly converted into a hotel, demonstrates that the neighboring private houses in this formerly fashionable district were also giving way to commercial establishments.
The Georgian revival church of Saint Paul's Chapel, the oldest surviving public building in Manhattan, provides a statelybackgroundfor the blurred activity caused by passing pedestrian and carriage traffic in theforeground. Beyond the chapel stands the Astor House, which was New York's grandest hotel in the mid-1800s. This bustling section of lower Broadway near Wall Street was a center of commercial activity when Silas A. Holmes made this image.
As was customary for promising Dutch painters in the 1600s, Gerrit van Honthorst traveled to Italy to complete his artistic training. In Rome he fell under the spell of Caravaggio's revolutionary style and adopted his use of realistic figures and dramatic lighting, known aschiaroscuro. In Italy he acquired the nicknameGherardo delle Notti(Gerrit of the Nights) because he painted so many night scenes lit by candles or torches.This recently discovered painting may have been made as analtarpiece. It shows theCrowning with Thorns, one of the last of the series of events comprising the trial ofChrist. His crude featuresilluminatedby a torch, a jeering soldier mocks Christ, who humbly accepts the soldier's derision. In the shadows, another soldier places the crown of thorns on Christ's head, using a cane to protect his own hands. At the left, two dimly lit figures, perhapsPontius Pilateand an advisor, discuss Christ's fate.
Smiling, singing figures gather around a balcony to play musical instruments, inviting the viewers below to join in the fun. The revelers' facial expressions and bright colorful clothes heighten the festive, carefree mood. A parrot and a dog, gazing down from their perches, round out the merry group. Possibly part of anallegoryof Harmony, the painting may have originally been slightly wider and twice as long, containing a completebalustradeand more figures. The head of the man at the top is a modern addition.Gerrit van Honthorst painted thisillusionisticceiling, the earliest of its type made in the Netherlands in 1622, two years after his return from Italy, where he saw similar painted ceilings. Careful calculation ofperspectiveallows the figures to burst plausibly through the flat plane of the painted panel.
A mother butters bread while her son stands beside her, his head bent in prayer over the food. He is about to depart for the school seen through the open front door and identified by the sign readingschole.A small triangular niche above the inner doorway holds several books and a candlestick, perhaps alluding to the enlightenment that education brings. A small top lying on the floor in front of the chamber doorway may refer to a Dutch proverb that states a child and a top will both fall idle unless continually  whipped.  Education and proper attitudes toward child-rearing were important issues in Protestant countries during the seventeenth century, and many paintings made during this period contain moral overtones and pious references.The use of vertical lines and geometric forms conveys the orderly simplicity of this interior scene. Natural light spills through the front door and onto the tiled entryway. In contrast, the foreground interior is dark, emphasizing a solemn and reverent moment in Dutch domestic life.
Rendered in minute detail, the golden border decoration on this page is drawn directly from late medieval churches, which were adorned inside and out with intricately carved sculpture. Statues of saints and prophets were often embedded in tracery, ornamental openwork based on elements of church architecture. Evoking a sacred setting, such tracery surrounds the figure in the right side of the frame, as well as King David as he kneels in prayer in the central scene.
Hand bells used for calling servants were traditionally made of silver or other metals in the 1700s. With the discovery of the recipe forporcelain, the Meissen porcelain manufactory became the first place in Europe to offer such objects to the consumer in porcelain.Decoration of early European porcelain often alluded to porcelain's Oriental origins. Two scenes of Chinese figures in imaginary settings decorate this bell. Scholars believe that these images are similar to the distinctive chinoiserie images designed by Johann Gregorius Hroldt, the chief decorator at the Meissen porcelain manufactory in the 1720s. He signed few pieces, but scholars have attributed many works to him based on his signed album of drawings, which still survives in Germany.
This vessel is really a  trick  pot. When wine is poured in at the base into a long funnel, the liquid does not spill out when the pot is righted, although there is no cover on the bottom. The wine pot copies a Chinese model in the form of a peach, a symbol of longevity in the Far East.The Meissen porcelain manufactory, where this wine pot was produced, was the first European factory to discover the recipe for making truehard-paste porcelain. The form of early vessels copied actual Chinese wares, while the painted decoration was based on fanciful chinoiseriemotifs. This pot depicts various imaginary scenes such as a tea ceremony and a goat herder.
These decorative vases included fifty-four different scenes filled with Chinese figures in various fantastic imaginary settings. Scholars believe that these images are similar to the distinctive chinoiserie images designed by Johann Gregorius Hroldt, the chief decorator in the 1720s at the Meissen porcelain manufactory. He signed few pieces, but scholars have attributed many works to him on the basis of a surviving signed album of drawings.These vases formed part of a garniture, a set of porcelain ornaments of various shapes that decorated the chimneypiece. Each of these vases is marked under the base with the monogramARforAugustusRex. Augustus the Strong was theElectorof Saxony and the king of Poland, who established a porcelain manufactory in the capital city of Dresden in the first decades of the 1700s. The factory later moved to the nearby town of Meissen.
In the turn of her head and her alert eyes, Louise Brongniart engages the viewer. Presented as a sweet, intelligent child, Louise was about five when sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon carved this portrait for her father, an architect and friend of the artist. Avoiding the empty sentimentality common in representations of children in the 1700s, he captured Louise's intelligence and liveliness. The youth of the sitter and the artist'snaturalisticrendering lighten the formality of thebust, a format adopted fromantiquesculpture. One of the greatest portrait sculptors of the late 1700s, Houdon popularized the genre of child portrait busts.Houdon made several copies and versions of this work. He probably made the first generation of this work, aterracottamodel now in theLouvre, as a gesture of friendship to Louise's father, Alexandre-Theodore Brongniart. Brongniart, the French geologist and mineralogist who served as the director of the SvresPorcelainFactory from 1800 until his death in 1847, probably then commissioned the marble version. Two other marble copies, as well as a bronze version, still exist.
Through exactingrealism, Jean-Antoine Houdon convincingly captured the skin's texture, and the underlying bone and musculature of this eminent figure. The sitter's attire and hair--styled with a long ponytail at the back--indicate his status as a high-ranking French government official. But Monsieur de Bir's personality also shows through in the bust's subtle features. The wrinkles around his eyes and the soft jowls that brush his scarf reveal advanced age. Yet his sparkling eyes and the upturned corners of his lips, which hint at a smile, convey a warm disposition.To accurately render Bir's likeness, Houdon measured his head and face with calipers, and probably made a plaster  life mask  for reference. He probably modeled thebustfirst in clay, and then made aplaster cast. From those initial studies, Houdon would have produced this final marble version, which he gave to the sitter. Bir may have commissioned the bust to celebrate his newly appointed position as a treasury official underLouis XVI.
In the late 1770s, Jean-Pierre-Louis-Laurent Hoel spent four years traveling through Sicily with a servant, a guide, and occasionally guards, stopping frequently to paint the barren landscapes. This large drawing shows a view of the valley of Agrigento in Sicily, also known as the Valley of the Temples. On the right, overlooking the basin, the chapel of San Biagio, which was built on the ancient ruins of the Temple of Ceres, overlooks the river below. The low vantage point and width of the paper emphasize the sky's breadth and the dramatic setting.French-born Hoel became fascinated by the landscape, customs, and antiquities of southern Italy during several long trips to the region. He planned a deluxe travel book on Sicily-then a primitive, unknown island on the edge of Europe-hoping to illustrate its beauty with panoramic views of the countryside and to describe its history, with commentary about the sites he visited. This panorama served as the model for a print in Volume IV of Hoel's bookLe voyage pittoresque des Isles des Sicilie, de Malte et de Lipari(A Picturesque Journey through the Islands of Sicily, Malta, and Lipari).
His  great babe  is how engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel referred to his creation, theGreat Eastern.At nearly twenty-two thousand tons, it was the largest ship built in the nineteenth century. Robert Howlett had been commissioned byThe Illustrated Timesto document its building and launching. In this photograph Howlett swung his camera away from the enormous ship to record the human reaction to the anticipated spectacle. The image has the casual structure of an unposedsnapshot. It was an illustration meant to accompany a newspaper account of the events. Looking nervously expectant, the men grouped around an imperious Brunel--the short man at the center front, facing right--on the dock were investors from the syndicate that had spent three million dollars for the ship's construction. Brunel did not want onlookers present, but the owners sold tickets and people came by the thousands. TheGreat Easternstubbornly refused to be moved down the launching ramp, and steam winch handles spun wildly out of control, killing two crewmembers and threatening the spectators. Several more months of pushing and pulling ensued before Brunel's ship was successfully waterborne.
In the early 1700s, English author Daniel Defoe complained that  Queen Mary introduced the custom...of furnishing houses with Chinaware...piling the China upon the Tops of Cabinets, Scritoires, and every Chymney Piece.  The greater availability of Chinese and Japaneseporcelainfrom the mid-1600s onwards increased interest in this exotic material. Nobles throughout Europe collected porcelain and created  China Cabinets.  In such rooms, walls were completely decorated with ceramics, displayed on brackets, mantelpieces, shelves, and sometimes even on the floor.Although some members of the British aristocracy collected mounted porcelain, they did not assemble the same quantities as the French did. In 1678 one English duchess took her collection of porcelain to France, where it fetched much higher prices at a sale. This pair of lidded bowls was assembled in London, perhaps for a sophisticated member of the court of Charles II. Recently returned from France, he had developed a taste for these luxurious objects there.
Hilde Hubbuch attended lectures at theBauhausin the summer of 1932. This abstractcompositionshows an affinity with the teachings there in its appreciation of the integrity of raw materials and its admiration for materials that are mass-produced, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
By juxtaposing Saint Paul's traumatic collapse with a poetic landscape setting, Wolf Huber heightened the inherent tension in one of the Bible's most dramatic stories. The idyllic atmosphere, the main figure's placement on a foreground stage, the large tree with abundant foliage, the delicate rendering of a mountainous background, and the elaborate, billowing drapery are all hallmarks of Huber's drawings. Possibly a preparatory sketch for a print, this drawing displays fine gradations of line that suggest light, texture, and space and show the influence of Albrecht Drer. This sheet probably originally included God the Father and additional angels above the dove of the Holy Spirit but was cut down.One of Christianity's most ruthless oppressors, Saul was traveling to Damascus when a heavenly light struck him blind and Jesus spoke to him. Jesus commanded to take Christianity to non-Jews, and for the next thirty years, he was a pillar of the new Christian church within the Roman Empire. Marking his conversion, Saul became known as Paul, and the story of his conversion became a popular illustration of God's grace towards all people, even the least deserving.
Sunlight breaks through rolling clouds and illuminates a lush valley. The expansive sky fills much of the composition, but the long horizontal bands of rich green and blue pigment that compose the valley draw our eye downward. This open vista is seen from an elevated vantage point--a curving road in the foreground. The modest, down-to-earth scene encourages us to imagine the artist himself, on-the-spot and out in nature, striving to capture this particular view at a particular time of day.Paul Huet traveled often to the French countryside to observe and draw its specific features and weather conditions. He was a frequent visitor to Normandy, in northern France, where he painted and sketched its cliffs and hills, rivers and beaches. This watercolor is one of many works he produced during these visits. Like other French artists of his generation, Huet was inspired to take up the medium after seeing watercolors by his English contemporaries.
A nervous pride is inscribed on the face of this non-commissioned officer, who wears the new uniform adopted for the Scottish Lanarkshire Yeomanry regiment in 1852. Thedaguerreotypistpositioned him at an angle to the camera in a three-quarter seated pose, his torso slightly twisted, so as to reveal as much of his costume as possible. With no visible means of back support, the man held himself perfectly erect for the long exposure in a proud, soldierly manner.
Jacob van Hulsdonck, the master of a prosperous studio specializing in still life painting, meticulously rendered every surface and texture of fruit, porcelain, and wooden tabletop in this painting. He was careful to paint the still life from a high vantage point so that most of the table and the bowl's contents could be seen. Lemons, oranges, and a pomegranate, some split open to expose their succulent insides, rest in a Chinese blue-and-white porcelain bowl, dating from the Wan-Li period of the Ming dynasty.The still life attests to the fragile and fleeting properties of the natural world. The dimpled skin of the lemons and oranges; the juicy, glistening insides of the pomegranate held gently together by the thin white tissue of the pulp; the leaves and blooms still attached to fruit; and the shiny droplets of water in the foreground are all brilliant, short-lived effects captured on canvas.
This scene marks the official beginning of the Los Angeles River, where the Arroyo Calabasas meets Bell Creek in Canoga Park. Humble positioned the dramatic concrete structure that cleaves the two waterways exactly in the center of his composition--not an easy task for the photographer, who had to wade upstream several hundred yards with his equipment to get to this vantage point.
A snarling lion decorates the interior of thisLakonianblack-figurekylixor cup. The placement of the lion's body, with its head turned back and its paw raised, serves to animate the creature and also represents the painter's attempt to find a creative way to fill the cup's circular interior. Simple rays, banding, andpalmettesat the handles decorate the cup's exterior.Vase-painters in Lakonia specialized in the decoration of cups, which were exported around the Mediterranean. The choice of an animal for the main decoration of the cup is somewhat unusual for Lakonian work. Unlike theCorinthianvase-painters, the Lakonians generally shunned the animal style in favor of scenes of people and mythology. The use of the animal style here probably reflects the general decline of Lakonian vase-painting in the mid-500s B.C.
A bird sign appeared to them, flying high and holding to the left and carrying in its talons a gigantic snake, blood-colored, alive still, and breathing, it had not forgotten its warcraft yet, for writhing back it struck the eagle that held it by the chest and neck, so that the eagle let it drop groundward in pain of the bite, and dashed it down in the midst of the battle and itself, screaming high, winged away down the wind's blast. And the Trojans shivered with fear as they looked on the lithe snake lying in their midst, a portent ofZeus. . . .In theIliad,the poetHomerdescribed an omen seen by the Trojans as they were attacking the Greek forces. Signifying the eternal conflict of the forces of the earth and the sky, themotifof the battling eagle and snake was used throughoutantiquity. On thisLakonianblack-figurekylixor cup, the Hunt Painter filled the interior with an eagle flying to the left, gripping the neck of a snake in its beak and clutching the serpent's long, undulating body in its talons. Stylized leaves and rays between bands decorate the exterior of the cup.
Saturn, one of the Titans who once ruled earth in Roman mythology, devours the infant child he holds in his arm. According to a prophecy, Saturn would be overthrown by one of his sons. In response, he ate his sons as soon as they were born. But the mother of his children, Rhea, hid one child, Zeus. Later, Zeus gave his father a potion, forcing him to regurgitate his siblings; he then vanquished his father and ruled over earth, fulfilling the prophecy. Saturn's cannibalism is graphically shown here: in his left hand he holds a bone from one of his already eaten children while he partially ingests the child in his arm.Simon Hurtrelle represented Saturn as a powerful, yet elderly figure with wings. The wings suggest the speed of time and derive from the association of Saturn, also known as Cronos, with the Greek god of time, Chronus. Similarly, Saturn's loss of hair indicates the passing of time. The composition of the bronze was inspired by an antique Roman marble sculpture that Hurtrelle saw in Rome.
In this eerie night scene at a lackluster carnival, the gaping black doorway and the figures in the foreground--blurred as a result of the film's extended exposure time--create an atmosphere appropriate to the terrors promised by a Haunted House. Set against a black Minnesota night sky, the bright floodlights along the building's facade illuminate an almost abandoned attraction. To date, David Husom has created a large collection of such images of deserted county fairgrounds.
When I go to take pictures, it's an escape from crowded scenes. Particularly with these fairgrounds; it's like a whole city that's all yours. The birds and doors flapping in the wind are the only sound. I don't have people in most of my pictures because I want to get down to the basic elements that are at the site.-- David HusomSet against the vivid, clear blue sky, this starkly simple white building appears archetypal in its symmetry. Windows and doors seem to be mere depressions in the facade, sealing the only practical means of exit in a once teeming fair building. Clouds emphasize the building's pyramid-shape, adding a surreal quality to the scene.This work is part of Husom's  Fairgrounds  series (1978-97), photographs of empty Midwestern fair buildings.
Although Dutch statesman Constantijn Huygens the Younger's goal was to record his travels, this expressive drawing transcends the category of topographical rendering. Through judicious use of rough ink, jotted diagonal slashes, and paper's blank whiteness as both sky and ground, the amateur draftsman created a compelling record of a chilly, windblown day.Huygens's drawings often accompanied descriptions in his diary. In typical fashion, Huygens recorded both this scene's location and the date on which he depicted it. Topographical landscapes were popular in seventeenth-century Holland, and drawing was considered an essential component of ahumanisteducation.
The Dutch fascination with nature is described in a riotous display of beautiful and exotic flowers. Arranged in a terracotta vase displaying an antique relief, Jan van Huysum included flowers from all seasons of the year--roses, anemones, hyacinths, tulips, and more--and painted them directly from life. The flowers' nearly overripe quality attests both to nature's bounty and its transience. The bouquet is ordered in a loose pyramidal shape, with flowers and greenery almost bursting to be free of the vase. Butterflies and other insects fly or crawl amongst the arrangement, and drops of water are visible on leafs and shiny petals.Van Huysum painstakingly applied layer upon layer of thin oil glazes to capture the brilliant colors and delicate textures of the blossoms. Because each flower could only be painted while in season, it sometimes took the artist several years to complete a single painting.
In what may be a companion piece to theVase of Flowers, Jan van Huysum combined the lustrous realism of seventeenth-century Dutch paintings with the bright colors characteristic of the eighteenth century in a lavish still life of fruit and flowers. The asymmetrical arrangement of bursting and overripe fruit spills over onto the ledge, some falling prey to insects. Flowers droop under the weight of their extravagant blooms. Van Huysum deftly rendered the translucence of the grapes, the crisp surfaces of the leaves, and the wiry texture of the vines.The highly finished surfaces of Van Huysum's paintings were the result of a laborious application of glazes to the canvas. He jealously guarded the details of this technique, allowing no visitors in his studio.
Still life painting flourished in Holland in the 1600s. A great interest in botany arose toward the end of the 1500s, when collectors of herbs and plants were spending fortunes on their gardens; their desire for portraits of their prized possessions fueled the popularity of flower painting. Later on, Dutch still lifes were eagerly taken up by French painters and collectors and came to decorate the most fashionable Frenchsalons.Like Jan van Huysum himself, this follower of Huysum embraced many different species in his composition, including flowers that do not bloom in the same season. While Van Huysum usually intended his ephemeral blossoms to convey aVanitasmeditation on the fleetingness of life, this artist's purpose was probably largely decorative. As in its companionVase of Flowers,the flowers take up nearly the entire canvas, emphasizing the arrangement's abundance. The composition is straightforward, centrally placed against a blank background that sets off the colorful flowers and their Rococo vase.
Dutch artists invented the flower piece, a type of painting that remained popular throughout the 1700s and 1800s, primarily in France. Artists used flower paintings as vehicles for brilliant color and animated composition, usually displaying an intense realism.Jan van Huysum was one of the most exuberant practioners of the genre. Working in the 1700s, Van Huysum acquired the sophisticated taste and love of embellishment associated with the Rococo period in France. While flower pictures often carried moral messages, this picture and its probable companion,Vase of Flowers,were conceived without didactic lessons for the viewer.
This image is a composite portrait of Thilo von Watzdorf and his parents and includes, in the mirror's reflection, a self-portrait of Gerald Incandela making the photograph. Joined together to create a continuous frame, the illusion of perfect seamlessness is broken by the visible edges of each print. The dual images of the mother and her reflection, seen from behind gesturing toward the camera, adds a cubist dimension of simultaneity, of seeing the scene from multiple angles in a single frame. The father, visible through an open door reading the newspaper in an adjoining room, also suggests an alternate vantage point.
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres made this drawing either as a preparatory sketch or as a presentation drawing for a commission that he accepted in 1815 because he was financially strapped. The fourteenth Duke of Alba ordered a painting to commemorate the third Duke of Alba, also known as the  Butcher of Flanders.  Here the infamous ancestor receives a hat and sword blessed by the pope for suppressingProtestantheresy in the Netherlands. As the governor-general of the Netherlands from 1567 to 1573, the duke had formed the Council of Troubles, nicknamed the  Council of Blood,  which condemned some 12,000 Protestant rebels to death.The drawing took many hours to make, including constructing a complicated cut-out replacement to correct the architecturalbackground. Despite reworking the picture into a red-dominatedcompositionsymbolizing a bloodbath, Ingres, repulsed, abandoned the painting in 1819. He later said that the painting remained a sketch- as God had wished.  Edgar Degas, a great admirer of Ingres, once owned the unfinished canvas. During World War II, Hermann Goering acquired the painting; at war's end it went to the Muse Ingres at Montauban, France.
Thomas Robinson, the third Baron Grantham and later Earl de Grey, was thirty-five when Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres drew this refined portrait. Ingres chose a pose that combined the informality of youth and the self-assurance of his subject's aristocratic origins. Grantham, who commissioned this portrait himself, stands confidently against a distant view ofSaint Peter's Basilica, an important site for Grand Tourists and one that Ingres often included in portraits.Ingres made this drawing when he was a struggling young artist living in Rome, earning his living by drawing portraits of wealthy visitors to the city.
Never did beauty more regal, more magnificent, more stately, and of a more Junoesque type, offer its proud lines to the tremulous pencil of an artist.Thus wrote critic Thophile Gautier after watching Ins Moitessier pose for this portrait. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres painted four oil portraits of her and made multiple drawings at many sittings. He made this drawing and six other preparatory studies for an early portrait.Both a realist and a classicist, Ingres gave his sitter cool, idealized features recalling the smooth, balanced proportions of ancient marble sculpture. In contrast to the detail of her expressionless face, he broadly indicated the hair's abstract shape and lightly sketched in the outlines of the surrounding flowers with reminder notes of appropriate colors.Edgar Degas, a great admirer of Ingres, once owned this drawing.
In the crook of her right arm, Madame Moitessier supports a loose, lacy shawl that twines around her. Her brooch attracts attention while the tiny necklace nearly disappears. In Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's later painting, a smaller brooch seems insignificant, while a long string of pearls echoes the flowing sweep of the woman's shawl and provides a purpose for the hand at her waist. He made two additional studies of her left hand in the upper right corner, exploring how she might hold the shawl.In this preparatory study for an 1851 painting, Ingres concentrated on the woman's dress, her jewels, and the positions of her arms and hands. To determine the figure's proportions, he drew a grid or  squared  the drawing. He freely worked out new ideas from the bodice on down, probably tracing the head and shoulders from another study. Ingres made many such preparatory sketches for his four painted portraits of Ins Moitessier, a banker's wife from a prominent family of government officials.
In depicting this angel, Innocenzo da Imola most importantly intended to analyze the effects of light and shadow on the drapery. Omitting such details as background, hair, and one foot, he focused on a flowing rhythm of drapery folds that is beautiful as an abstract design. The brown-tinted paper plays an active role, serving as the middle tone between the highlights in brushed-on white gouache and the spots of deepest shadow in brown wash and black chalk.Innocenzo first made the full figure, then reconsidered the drapery in the second, smaller study at the lower right. Expanding the fabric more fully gave him a more interesting, more three-dimensional surface with which to display his mastery. He made this drawing in preparation for an angel in one of his altarpieces in Bologna.
The Greek heroOdysseusslits the throat of a Thracian warrior. On the back of the vase, Diomedes grabs the sleeping Rhesos, king of the Thracians, just before plunging his sword into the chest of thisTrojanally. The corpses of Rhesos's men, presumably killed in their sleep, litter the ground. As the story was recounted inHomer'sIliad, Odysseus and Diomedes infiltrated the Thracian camp outside the walls of Troy, hoping to steal their fine horses. This vase is the only depiction of the murder of Rhesos in theArchaicperiod; it is remarkably close to Homer's account, down to the display of armor and the Thracian horses who panic on their tethers under the handles of the vase.When the Greeks began founding colonies in Italy and Sicily in the 600s B.C., they initially imported fine decorated pottery. Soon, however, local pottery workshops arose. Chalkidian pottery, one of these local productions in theblack-figure technique, was probably made in the city of Rhegion, a colony of the Greek city of Chalkis.
Standing alone on the empty beach with her baskets, a despondent fisherwoman gazes out at the approaching storm. Two fishing boats tilt sideways on the sand behind her, marooned on the beach by the receding tide. A windmill sits high on the edge of the sands on the left of the scene. But Eugne Isabey made the dark, threatening sky the drawing's focus, concentrating on the murky black clouds that cover the leaden sea.Isabey conveyed the scene's drama through a subtle interplay of darkness and light. Dark sweeps of watercolor covey the looming storm, while white streaks ofgouachesuggest the faint glimmer of light on the horizon. The fresh, vigorous brushstrokes are visible in the tangled strokes that suggest the mounds of sand. The scene's free watercolor technique and dramatic evocation of foul weather typify theRomanticlandscape. In the 1830s Isabey produced a series of lithographs based on marine subjects; this scene probably formed the basis for one of them.
A mature woman gazes out from this Romano-Egyptian mummy portrait. The name of the woman, Isidora, is written on what remains of the cartonnage, or linen mummy case. She wears an elegant, braided hairstyle that was fashionable in the early 100s A.D., and she is fully accessorized with a gold hairpin, gold-and-pearl earrings, and three necklaces heavy with gold and jewels. At the time of her burial, the wreath in her hair and the diamond pattern around the edge of the portrait were added ingold leaf. Also tiny bits of gold leaf were added to her necklaces and earrings, which were originally rendered only in yellow paint.Although little of the mummy case is preserved, it belonged to a small group of mummies wrapped in characteristic reddish-colored shrouds. In Egyptian religion, red is associated with life and regeneration.
When the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley saw drawings of these ruins of ancient Egypt, he wrote:  Look on my works ye mighty and despair.  This is a view of the Ramasseum, the funerary temple of Ramses II on the west bank of the Nile River at Thebes. The remains of a 57-foot (17 meter) seated statue of Ramses II litter theforeground. Jules Itier photographed the scattered remains twenty-five hundred years after the temple's destruction by earthquake and subsequent quarrying. The shattered colossus was the subject of Shelley's poem  Ozymandias. 
I think all photographers make documentary photography, but, afterwards, it all comes down to how each person interprets what they see, whether it has more or less poetry or imagination.--Graciela IturbideA faceless man exposes a massive tattoo of the Virgin Mary on his back. The dusty landscape seems devoid of any activity or importance, but in fact is the politically fraught Mexican-US border.Graciela Iturbide's photographs capture nuances of cultural identity. Even the tattoo is a highly coded element; it depicts Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe--also calledLa Virgen Morena, or the brown-skinned Virgin. Some speculate that Mexico's indigenous Virgin of Guadalupe has roots in the Aztec mother goddess Tonantzin. The characteristic wavy, pointed tendrils that surround her evoke rays of holy light. However, these are also thought to refer to something organic, namely the spiked agave plant, which Mexicans ferment intopulque, mezcal, and tequila--alcoholic beverages enjoyed on the Virgin of Guadalupe's feast day.Like her mentor, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide is known for photographs that explore the diversity of her native Mexico, especially its indigenous peoples. In this particular image, Virgin of Guadalupe's likeness might function as a symbol of pride, identity, or even as a protective talisman in a difficult world.
A journey into Yellowstone Valley required several days of arduous travel via rail, stagecoach, and mule train when Jackson went there in 1870. His pictures, combined with extensive reports from the government-sponsored expedition, moved the United States Congress to designate the area a national park in 1872. Jackson captured Old Faithful geyser with a mammoth-plate camera, which exposed negatives that are the same size as this print. He included a figure at lower left to convey the enormity and heighten the romanticism of this awesome natural phenomenon.Old Faithful, a geyser that throws about ten thousand gallons of water and steam up to one hundred seventy feet in the air, was so named in 1870 by the Washburn-Langford-Doane geological expedition because it seemed to spout  faithfully  for about five minutes every hour or so. In actuality, the eruptions occur more irregularly, with intervals varying from as much as half an hour to two and a quarter hours.
Spend your vacation in the Santa Cruz Mountains. . . . Beautiful new rustic cottages . . . surrounded by hundreds of acres of beautiful redwood, madrone and oak timber. Splendid walks and drives through the woods. The best of spring water piped to each cottage. . . . Hunting, fishing, croquet, tennis, shooting gallery, swimming pool and other amusements. . . .This 1905 advertisement boasts the pleasures and pastimes that awaited tourists to the Santa Cruz Mountains. The area featured guest accommodations beginning in 1859, when one clever developer built his home, store, and cottages into live redwood trees and stumps. With the expansion of the railroad, wilderness areas became increasingly accessible to the traveling public. Many resorts sprang up along the California coast, but Santa Cruz was one of the most beautiful and most desirable destinations. Big Tree Station, named for Santa Cruz's large redwood trees, was part of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The photograph's size and format suggests that it was intended for commercial purposes, possibly as a souvenir for the tourist industry to entice prospective California settlers.
Singing through the forest, rattling over ridges,Shooting over arches, dashing under bridges,Whizzing through the mountain, buzzing o'er the vale,Bless me this is pleasant riding on a rail.This ballad from the 1840s reflects passengers' excitement about train travel, which made it possible to speed through the landscape at a new pace--three times as fast as stagecoaches. To achieve this efficiency, rails had to be level, so engineers built bridges, trestles, and tunnels to facilitate an even path. William Henry Jackson made this photograph standing in one such engineering achievement--a tunnel for the Colorado Midland Railway. He positioned his camera so that the craggy mouth of the tunnel created a natural frame for a well-dressed group of passengers assembled on and around a train's caboose, with the mountains beyond. This photograph would have been an excellent advertisement, illustrating the ease of passengers, and the beauty of the scenery.
Atop Mount Ouray in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, William Henry Jackson made this panoramic photograph of a train traversing Marshall Pass. The billowing steam engine is barely visible in the centerforeground, about to pass a group of sheds that line the track. Jackson made this photograph in the 1880s, when settlers were moving farther and farther westward. At the time, he was working for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, which would have used the photograph to advertise the handsome scenery surrounding the route.
We traveled at least eighteen miles an hour when at full speed, and made the whole distance averaging as much as twelve miles an hour. This seemed like annihilating space.Ulysses S. Grant's comments on his first experience with rail travel reflect how the locomotive changed people's concept of distance. The railroad opened up geographic areas that were previously inaccessible and in doing so  destroyed  space by reducing the distance between two points. Summarizing the railroad's success, Grant concluded that the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.William Henry Jackson's photograph shows a train on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad passing through a remote wilderness area. The recently deforested hill above the train's path provided lumber for trestles and for the ties beneath the railroad's iron rails.
Telegraph lines and neatly laid wood ties and iron rails contrast with the irregular pattern of a canyon's craggy rock face, signaling that the introduction of the railroad into remote areas forever altered the landscape. The arrival of trains along the Arkansas River, which flows through Colorado and Kansas, also marked a shift in the region's economy. Barges and steamboats had previously controlled the movement of goods and passengers along the river, but the railroad's lower fares soon led to a new monopoly on transportation in the area. This photograph specifically illustrates a narrow section of the river that would have been difficult for large water vessels to navigate. Though laying tracks in this area was challenging, engineers devised structures, such as the short bridge in the distance, that overcame all obstacles.
Both the tracks of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway and a narrow, nearly parallel section of the Rio Grande River snake through the landscape, carving a path through the inhospitable landscape. A solitary figure sits in the leftforeground, looking across the tracks; his presence could urge viewers to contemplate the effect of  progress  on the terrain. Such thoughts open up the subjects of industrialism and the uniquely American history of westward expansion.Embudo, located between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Taos, is home to one of the few railroad stations remaining from the 1800s. Though train travelers no longer stop there, the building now operates as a restaurant.
After years of struggling to capture the grandeur of the Western landscape, William Henry Jackson made this sublime view of the Grand Canyon. Dwarfed by the enormous rocky outcropping below, above, and behind him, a man--probably a surveyor--looks through a telescope to the other side of the canyon. Clearly conveying the awe-inspiring scale of the Western landscape by contrasting human and natural scale, this image belongs to a tradition of landscape and expedition photography meant to elicit a strong emotional response.
At a height of 150 feet, this bridge in Dale Creek, Wyoming, sometimes swayed in strong winds. The longest trestle on the Union Pacific Railroad's line, its soaring height and stilt-like supports still inspire awe. William Henry Jackson hiked partway into the dry, inhospitable creekbed to make this image, pointing his camera upward to maximize the bridge's height and to highlight the Union Pacific's engineering achievement.
A steam engine winds through the steep, rocky terrain of the American West on a tightly curved loop of track above a rushing river--an exciting sight for viewers in the 1800s. Since railroad tracks commonly passed through areas that were previously inaccessible, such landscapes were often unfamiliar. Railroad photographers sought to depict the grand engineering achievements of the trains in ways that would most appeal to their potential customers. As part of an awe-inspiring landscape, bridges, tunnels, and loops like this one appeared even more magnificent.
On an especially sunny day in southwestern Colorado, William Henry Jackson stood beside the Rio de Las Animas Perdidas--River of Lost Souls--and pointed his camera slightly upward. From that position he photographed five individuals posed in front of a train making its way through a remote, rocky pass. This steep, craggy mountain was one of many into which workers carved roadbeds for railroad tracks. Piles of small chips lining the edge of the river below reveal that the workers disposed of the waste by simply throwing it to the side. Railroads both promoted such engineering feats and united distant places, but Jackson referred to neither in titling his image. On a boulder in the bottom left corner, he merely wrote,  1077A, Caon of the Rio Asanimas, W.H. Jackson, Denver, CO. 
Juxtaposing one engineering feat with another, William Henry Jackson made this photograph of a railroad engine passing beneath an arch of an aqueduct, sixty-nine feet high. The aqueduct, which provides water for the city of Quertaro in central Mexico, was built between 1726 and 1738, but the railroad did not arrive there until a hundred and fifty years later, in 1886. A close study of the image reveals a porter standing in the open doorway of the first car and a number of youthful passengers leaning out the windows of the rear car. In any city, the arrival of the railroad was invariably a cause for celebration; Jackson's photograph commemorates the introduction of this new method of transportation in the context of an earlier achievement.
Marie-Antoinette sat in this chair while her servants arranged her hair and applied her makeup in her bedroom at the Petit Trianon a small house built on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. Known as achaise de toilette, its swivel mechanism and low back were specially designed for performing the daily rituals of dressing. It is finely carved with bands of lily of the valley and ivy along the curved supports of the arms, while the legs and edge of the circular seat imitate caning.The Petit Trianon was given to the queen by her husband, Louis XVI, as a private retreat where she could escape from the rigid etiquette of court life. Marie-Antoinette furnished these intimate apartments, which were never seen by most of the courtiers, with exquisite furniture that reflected her own personal taste.This chair was part of a set of furniture delivered to the palace in 1787 that also included two armchairs, two side chairs, a fire screen, and a stool. The bed from the set is missing, but the rest remains at the Petit Trianon. The other pieces retain the original pastel-colored paint in yellow, blue, green, and white that has unfortunately been stripped from this chair.
Furniture became increasing specialized in the 1700s in France, as craftsmen produced objects for use at every occasion. Chairs came in a variety of shapes and sizes and were one of the most important features in a formal reception room. They were designed either aschaises courants(literally, running chairs), to be moved around the room as needed, orchaises meublants(fixed chairs), to be placed against the wall as part of the interior architecture.This pair of armchairs, designed by one of the most famous French chairmakers in the late 1700s, was probably placed in the middle of the room and grouped as required. They are imaginatively carved in theNeoclassicalmanner, with fluting, rosettes, stars, and stylized leaves.
This suite of matching furniture, a set of ten armchairs and a settee, is all upholstered with tapestry covers each portraying a different bird. Artisans made the frames from solid mahogany, a fashionable but expensive hardwood that had to be imported into France. Beginning in 1806, during the Napoleonic wars, a Continental blockade prevented France from buying mahogany from the English colonies. Although this impediment further increased the price of the wood, it remained extremely popular among the upper classes.Furniture built in the first decades of the 1800s was heavier and more majestic than earlier styles. In this suite, gilt bronzemountsin the form of rosettes, strands of bellflowers, and leaves decorate the legs, arms, and backs of the chairs and settee.
Hands are a prominent element in many of Lotte Jacobi's portraits, which she used to express a freshness of gesture and the individuality of the handprint. The unidentified engineer's hands clutching a pipe, his tweed coat sleeves faint in thebackground, connote an erudite, cultured man of a certain age without showing so much as a hint of his face.
An ovalroundelimitating a framed painting fills the center of this tapestry. In a scene fromVirgil'sAeneid,the goddessVenusapproaches her husbandVulcan, trying to coax him to make weapons for her mortal sonAeneas. She has just descended from her chariot in the clouds on the left, accompanied by six white doves and acupid. Vulcan sits with his hammer and sword, while two cyclopes work in his forge on the right.The designers expanded the size of the wide border, known as thealentours,to fill the required space on a particularly long wall. The floral garlands, metal vases, and exotic birds are elements common to several of the other tapestries in this set, but two new trophies hanging from blue ribbons were added. To the left hangs an ornament symbolizing pastoral music by incorporating a horn, a book of music, and two tambourines. To the right, a straw basket, shepherd's horn, a drum, and floral headbands symbolize pastoral activities.This tapestry is also based on designs by Louis Tessier and Jacques Neilson.
Based on Book VII ofOvid'sMetamorphoses,theroundelin this tapestry shows Aurora, goddess of the dawn, gazing upon the sleeping form of her lover, the hunter Cephalus. She sits among clouds with the morning star shining on her forehead. Cephalus, a mortal who is bound to the earth, reclines on the forest floor, but his dog awakens as the goddess approaches.This roundel imitates a painting set in an oval frame, complete with Franois Boucher's signature under Cephalus. Exotic birds and a hunting trophy in the center ornament thealentoursor decorative setting, which was narrower than others in the set in order to fit the shorter wall of a room.This tapestry is also based on designs by Louis Tessier and Jacques Neilson.
In this tapestry, one of a set of four,Venusrises from turbulent waters in the centerroundel. Artists in the 1700s based this popular subject on various writings from ancient Greece and Rome. The roundel imitates a painting set in an oval frame, complete with Franois Boucher's signature on a rock. The scene is also inscribed with1766,the date the design orcartoonwas produced, rather than the year the tapestry was woven. Exotic birds, floral garlands, and a musical ornament in the center decorate thealentoursor border, which was narrower than others in the set in order to fit the shorter wall of a room.This tapestry also is based on designs by Louis Tessier.
Prosperous eighteenth-century Dutch citizens were so proud of their gardens that they hired artists like Johannes Janson to record them for posterity. The estate shown here may have been located in the province of Noordholland, north of Amsterdam. The picture shows the wealth and the sophisticated leisure afforded by the estate: the promenade at left leads to farmland, while the path at right leads to a shipping scene, two primary sources of Holland's prosperity.The flower gardens in theforegroundform abroderie parterre,literally  embroidery flower bed ; these gardens were often designed by the same artists who made drawings for bedspreads, bed hangings, and other items. They were not filled with flowers but with a contrasting soil or gravel, neatly framed with small box plants.
Using broadly applied black chalk, Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen suggested deep shadows at the waist, where this young woman folds her soft hands. Subtle highlights pick up the gleam of the pearl strands looped around her wrists and the shimmering highlights on her skin and sleeves. With few strokes, only two colors, and much use of blank paper, Janssens effectively rendered both texture and volume.Janssens probably learned the technique of drawing hand studies in chalks on blue paper from Anthony van Dyck while both artists were in London. The pinholes along the drawing's outer edge suggest that he attached the sheet of paper to a board or easel as he drew the sitter's hands from life. He made this study in preparation for a half-length portrait painting.Scholars know little about the subject, referred to as  Jefrow Raphune  in the inscription at the bottom of the drawing. She must have been a married woman from the northern Netherlands; it was the custom in that area to wear one's wedding ring on the right index finger, as she does. The two elaborate rings and expensive pearls suggest that she was a relatively wealthy member of the landed gentry.
The Discovery and Translation of the Body of Saint Anthonyrelates the remarkable life story ofSaint Anthony Abbot, followed by an account of the miracles associated with hisrelicsafter his death, both in French(Invention et translation du corps de Saint Antoine).A full-pageminiaturedivided into four scenes is devoted to each half of thenarrativenear the beginning of themanuscript, and a series ofhistoriated initialsdecorates the rest of the text. Theilluminationsare executed in agrisailletechnique, where the predominant purple-gray is sometimes heightened with gold or embellished with other touches of color.The most imposing and accomplishedilluminationin the book is a half-page miniature placed at the end that shows thepatronof the manuscript kneeling in prayer before Saint Anthony Abbot. This image, likely by theFlemishartist Dreux Jean, is surrounded by a full border that incorporates the still unidentifiedcoat of armsof the patron.
Margam Hall was the newly constructed TudorGothichome of Christopher  Kit  Talbot, a close friend of Calvert Richard Jones and cousin of William Henry Fox Talbot, one of the inventors of photography who had taught photography to Jones. Jones could not capture the breadth of this opulently sprawling structure within the field of vision of a regular lens, so he used what he called a  double picture,  or panorama. Jones made overlapping exposures by  mov[ing] the camera in a small arc 'till the left-hand side of the second view coincides with the right hand side of the first.  These exposures could then be joined to form a visual whole. The figures carefully grouped on the grounds are the Talbot and Jones families. The blurring of several of the figures is a reminder that the exposure time, even in sunlight, was long and the people had to stand as still as possible to achieve the appearance of casualness.
Seen from behind, a man's arm curves possessively around the waist of his female companion. A refined woman dressed in fashionable seventeenth-century Dutch clothing walks down the aisle of the church with her greyhound in tow. In this interior scene, Anthonie de Lorme depicted the pulpit section of the middle nave of theLaurenskerk(Church ofSaint Lawrence) in Rotterdam. Warm sunlight floods the church and illuminates the soaring beauty of theGothicarchitecture. The clear, precise lines of thecompositionand the relative austerity of the setting were typical of DutchProtestantchurch interiors after the Council of Trent. In effect from 1545 to 1563, the Council aimed to reform the excesses of art in the Roman Catholic Church.The visitors seen here, dressed both in elegant clothes as well as peasant costumes, were probably painted by the Dutch artist Ludolf de Jongh, who was also active in Rotterdam at this time.
A male figure kneels down on a step or platform, with his left hand raised in a pointing gesture and the right lowered to give support. The drawing's bold lines and strong angles suggest a feeling of tremendous power and strength. Although the man's identity is unknown, scholars believe that the drawing might have been made as a study for anapostlewho kneels in front of theVirgin Maryin anAssumption of the Virginpainting. In this large-scale drawing, Jacob Jordaens concentrated on the flowing drapery that covers the man's body from his neck to ankles, showing the way the light reflected off the folds in the fabric. Jordaens applied the black chalk energetically, describing the outline of the drapery with a thick, strong line. Various layers of coloredpigmentsthen added shadows to the fabric. He finished the work with an application of a thick coat of massicot bodycolor tohighlightthe cloak and violet wash to articulate the strip of lining visible behind the figure's left hand. A rough outline of another kneeling man stands out among the lightly outlined figures on the verso.
To create a dynamiccompositionout of a single head, Jacob Jordaens used two colors of chalk plus bodycolor and a wash. The young woman's broad face fills the sheet squarely, with her eyes demurely cast down and lips pursed. Bold red chalk hatching suggests the ruddy color of her cheeks, while curving strokes of black chalk layered with lines of wash form her wispy hair. Dark areas of wash around her eyes give them depth. Throughout his career, Jordaens made many such studies of heads drawn from life, of his wife and of other women.
While enjoying the pleasant weather outside a tavern, this rowdy group of merrymakers finds added delight in wine, song, and women. Seated at the center of the table, a woman clutching her glass shrinks from the brazen advances of a drunken man. On the left, a man throws his arms in the air, abandoning himself to song and capturing the attention of a dog whose paws rest in his lap. Other singing men surround the table, accompanied by a bagpipe player in the rear. On the far left, an intoxicated fellow has knocked over the crockery and is vomiting.Jacob Jordaens heavily worked this drawing with gouache and watercolor to create a rich finish that reflects the earthy humor of the subject. Using broken, angular lines and a delicate balance of light and shadow, Jordaens imbued his figures with movement and depth.Jordaens's raucous scene may have served to illustrate a popular proverb of the 1600s:  Ill gained, ill spent.  Like many Dutch artists of his time, Jordaens depicted moral sayings in many of his drawings and in a set of tapestry designs that was purchased by the governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647.
A crowd of Israelites gathers to observe a dramaticOld Testamentmiracle. After they wandered in the wilderness of the Sinai desert without water, God saved them by instructingMosesto strike a rock with his staff, whereupon fresh water gushed out.Jacob Jordaens conveyed the scene's drama through energetic motion and repetition. Using a characteristicallyBaroquesweeping horizontalcomposition, he effortlessly interwove human figures and animals into afriezethat follows from left to right, from anticipation--with jars and drinking vessels at the ready--to Moses' theatrical gesture. The figures' proportions and subtleforeshorteningindicate that Jordaens intended the picture to be viewed from below.Here Jordaens repeated a subject he had first attempted nearly three decades earlier, following his usual practice of reworking ideas and finding new solutions. As here, the devoted Calvinist Jordaens often made instructive, rather than devotional, religious pictures.
Gilles Joubert was eighty years old when he delivered this chest of drawers to the French royal family. It is one of a pair that was made for theVersaillesbedroom of Madame Louise, a daughter ofLouis XV. TheJournalof the royal household's furnishings records its delivery on August 28th, 1769, along with the name of its maker, its dimensions, a detailed description of the piece, and its assigned inventory number, 2556.2, which is boldly inscribed on the back.Thetrellismarquetrymounted with gilt-bronze rosettes at the cross-sections is a decorativemotiffrequently found on Joubert's furniture. The thickgilding, large size, carefully detailedmounts, and heavy marble top all contribute to an overall impression of luxury suitable for a royal owner.
Juan de Juanes actively worked out his ideas in this drawing, first in black chalk lines, which are faintly visible under the bolder pen-and-ink forms. In the earlier chalk rendition, he drew the figure ofChristfarther to the left, carrying the cross with his right arm. The soldier to the right, leading him by the rope about his neck, was also father to the left, while two additional soldiers, faintly drawn in the top right, were not developed in pen. The Holy Women kneeling before him also changed when Juanes finished the drawing in pen after making the chalk underdrawing. He used the brown ink to model the forms in three dimensions with extensive, insistent hatching and cross-hatching. The artist's technique and the spatial clarity of the individual figures reflect the influence of Raphael, whose paintings he studied on a visit to Italy around 1560.
Surrounded by the deep blue, lapis lazulibackgroundof the gold frame, the silverVirgin Mary, crowned asQueen of Heaven, projects from the background in an elegant swirl of drapery. She stands on a globe, symbol of her dominion withChrist. Around her head glow the twelve stars of Saint John the Evangelist's apocalyptic vision. Under her feet she tramples a snake, understood as a sign of the Immaculate Conception. Cherub heads rise in lowrelieffrom the arabesques of clouds.An exuberant array of silver figurative, floral, and patterned elements enlivens the gilt bronze frame's complex shape, giving it a jewel-like splendor. In the centralmedallion, the contrast of the matte background with the highly polished surfaces of the Virgin and the globe ensure that the relief scene equals the decorative impact of the ornate frame. The proliferation of a variety of small-scale decorativemotifs; the contrasts in texture, surface, and shape; and the flowing lines in this work are characteristics of the florid lateRococoin Italy.Francesco Natale Juvara, one of the finest makers of liturgical metalwork in Sicily, probably designed this wall plaque to decorate a chapel.
This study for an elaborateBaroquestage set appears as if set in a courtyard surrounded by a covered walkway.Corinthiancolumns support the structure, while sculptures set on pedestals decorate the sides. Two angels with their trumpets perch atop the columns at the entrance to the illusionistically receding structure. At the rear, a gently flowing fountain tops a domed niche.Filippo Juvarra sketched the architecture with quick, fluid strokes that easily captured the lavish setting. His freely moving pen suggested a delicate pattern in the arching dome underneath the fountain and the fringed edge of the stage curtain overhead. Broad strokes ofwashcreate the hanging swags of fabric and give a sense of dappled sunshine where dark patches of shadow contrast with areas of brilliant light.Juvarra produced this drawing and seven others in the process of designing the stage sets for an opera that was first performed at a Roman theater in 1714. Though he did not use this design in that production, he may have transformed this sketch into another scheme during the development of the project.
Paul Juvenal the Elder based this architectural vista on the Augustinian Church in Nuremberg, which was torn down in 1819. Large portions of the paper are left blank, which gives the architecture a sense of spaciousness suffused with light. Use of a thin-nibbed, sparsely inked pen, briefly sketched ornament, lack of figures, and fine, ruled lines further emphasize the building's verticality and space. Blue wash--more luminous and airy than the common brown wash--increases the soaring effect of the vaults and the interior's sunlit feeling. The color's decorative quality also complements the delicacy of the  fish bubble  vaulting.Juvenal made this drawing as apreparatory studyfor a 1611 painting on copper. Unlike most Northern European architectural painters, who drew directly on the panels they planned to paint, Juvenal often made perspectival  construction drawings  like this one.
Explaining the abundance of photographic activity in this state, Los Angeles resident Arthur Kales wrote,  Nature has climatically and scenically endowed California beyond her needs. Conditions are ideal for the enjoyment of photography the year round.  Kales frequently used dancers as models for his dramatic, staged pictures, posing them in wooded settings or on movie sets.
After seeing a poster advertising Egyptian Deities brand cigarettes, Ruth St. Denis became fascinated with eastern forms of dance and costume. St. Denis, one of the early innovators of modern dance in America, co-founded the influential Los Angeles dance school Denishawn. Dissatisfied with traditional ballet and the notion of dance as mere entertainment, she explored dance as a medium of spiritual and philosophical expression.
Luxury objects, such as the ornateManneristewer, steeple cup, and elegant glass vessels, are carefully arranged on a table in this Dutch still life. An open pomegranate and a bowl of fruit rest on white drapery. To the right, a lemon and three olives are reflected in a silver plate that rests precariously on the table's edge. Behind this, a platter holds a tankard whose elaborate polished surface reflects the adjacent wineglass. Light falls from the left, playing across these precious objects and causing them to glitter and shine.Willem Kalf delighted in the play and contrast of transparent and reflective surfaces: the finely wrought metal of the ewer, the representation of smooth glass, the weave of the linen drapery, the dry crumbly texture of the bread, and the wet, shiny insides of the open pomegranate. At first glance, this still life implies an absence of human presence. But a closer look reveals just the opposite. The torn bread, half empty glass of wine, sliced fruit, and overturned glass allude to human intervention, as if these lavish delicacies were abruptly left on the table.
Like this one, the typicalCycladickandilahas a bulbous body, a high neck, a pedestal foot, and four pierced lugs on the body. The kandila form was very common, produced in both marble and clay and in a wide range of sizes. Kandiles take their name from their resemblance to modern Greek church lamps. Cords strung through the pierced lugs would have fastened a lid on the vessel, which would have held liquids such as oil or wine.
Measuring almost two feet in height, this life-size turkey was made as part of an extraordinary commission from Augustus the Strong, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, who envisioned a life-size porcelain menagerie for his Japanese Palace in Dresden. Though he had already amassed an unrivaled collection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain, Augustus wanted these new figures to be produced by his own factory at Meissen. When Augustus placed the order for these porcelain animals, the Meissen factory was still of very limited experience, having only discovered the formula forhard-paste porcelainabout twenty years prior. The figure was modeled by Johan Joachim Kndler, a sculptor who was hired by the manufactory in 1731 to assist with the commission for the animalsProducing such large figures presented a number of challenges for Kndler and the Meissen craftsmen. The clay's thickness and weight and uneven shrinking frequently caused the animals to crack and collapse in the kiln. This turkey, along with all other sculptures for Augustus, was originally meant to be painted in the animal's natural colors; however, doing so proved technically impossible. Despite these difficulties, the figures stand as important examples of an early and experimental aspect of ceramic art.
An entry dated20th November 1745in the workbook of Johann Kndler, the Meissen porcelain manufactory's chief modeler, describes the model for this piece:  A large Japanese group, with a pagod [man] seated on a green bank, next to him a Japanese woman who holds a sunshade over his head, close to him a parrot, which he feeds.  One of only two known examples, this brightly colored porcelain group is characteristic of the whimsical European view of Asia in the 1700s. The exoticism of the Far East fired the imaginations of European craftsmen, who mixed elements of Japanese and Chinese style to create a new type of decoration known aschinoiserie.Here  Japanese  figures wear robes decorated with fancifully drawnIndianische Blumen(East Indies flowers) and carry an ornate parasol decorated with a dragon.
On the vanguard of American Pictorialism, a movement that sought to elevate photography's status by emulating painting, Ksebier believed the medium to be a means of self-expression. Her shadowy portrait of a mother and child set against the simple geometry of a stable stall demonstrates her sense of design as well as her reverence for maternity. With a transparent veil and classical draperies, she transformed an ordinary woman into the archetypal Madonna of religious painting. The atmospheric contrast of light and shadow, soft focus, and the velvety surface of the platinum print heighten the painterly effect.
Gertrude Ksebier may have intended this photograph of her daughter and namesake as a bridal portrait. Shown in a silhouetted profile and kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, the younger Gertrude is framed by the balcony door, with the railing behind her simulating an ornate altar rail. The sunlight that flows in through the open door and gently bathes the room also glimmers through the veil covering her face and trailing down her back. The print's vertical cropping emphasizes the figure, more clearly defining her posture of prayer.
This thin, slightly curving bronze rises to a height of more than twelve feet. At its tip and bottom, the piece is flat. A matte-black patina provides a smooth and neutral surface that emphasizes the form's sharp silhouette. In sunlight, the sculpture casts its own double--a dramatic and attenuated shadow.In the early 1970s, Ellsworth Kelly began creating totem-like sculptures in a variety of materials including wood, aluminum, and weathering steel. This work is one of a handful of  totems  Kelly executed in bronze. The artist used a source from antiquity--the rigid, upright statues of young men known askouroi.
This Roman herm depicts the Greek comic playwrightMenander, who lived from about 342 to 291 B.C. The herm reproduces the head of a lost Greek bronze portrait statue by Kephisodotos the Younger and Timarchos, the sons of the artist Praxiteles. The Roman writerPausaniasmentions the original Greek bronze statue, which was set up in theTheater of Dionysosin Athens shortly after Menander's death.The middle-aged man shown in this portrait is known from several other versions of the statue, and the occasional example inscribed with his name confirms the identification of all of these versions as Menander. His plays enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in the Roman period, creating a demand for portraits of him.Beginning in the 500s B.C., Greeks placedherms, pillars surmounted by a head of the godHermes, at physical boundaries, such as crossroads or even doorways. Such places were sites of ritual and worship where the herms served a magical, protective function. The Romans later adapted the Greek concept of the herm, using it for non-religious, decorative purposes. The heads on Roman herms are often portraits of famous people.
Jagged reflections strike the water in electric bolts of light as a swimmer glides through the pool, his curious form looking like a disembodied crab claw. His striped trunks help identify his human form as his head disappears in the movement of the water. The swimmer casts a deep shadow on the shallow bottom, while other shadows melt into the fluid scene, circling his body like swarming black fish. In Andre Kertsz's split-second exposure, the swimmer's extended body seems to hover suspended in the water.
We were  sportive,  we three brothers.... We went swimming, running, mountain climbing--everything.... [Eugenio] had the body of the good athlete that he was and a fine head for a faun.-- Andr KertszSixty years after this photograph was made, Andr Kertsz recalled his life in Hungary with his two brothers, Imre and Eugenio, the latter the model in this photograph. Kertsz transformed the silhouetted form of his brother leaping dramatically between leaves of foliage into a mythical creature of fairy tales. The oval trimming of the print creates a precious miniature, contributing to the photograph's whimsical quality.
Balancing his rigid body upside down on the top rung of a ladder, the unidentified circus performer in this photograph has captured the attention of the man leaning over the railing at lower right. Framed by the arched roof overhead and wearing street clothes, he appears to be practicing his routine for his audience of two: the leaning man and Andre Kertsz. The camera captured the static quality of his gravity-defying pose.
Like other photographers who took dance as a subject, Andr Kertsz appreciated the ability of the camera to capture  people in motion . . . the moment when something changes into something else.  He made this image in the Paris studio of a fellow Hungarian emigr, the sculptor Istvn Bethy. The subject is the Hungarian dancer and cabaret performer Magda Frstner. In a playful response to Bethy's sculpture on the left, she strikes a pose on the couch.
 People in motion are wonderful to photograph. It means catching the right moment...when one thing changes into something else,  recalled Andre Kertsz of his portrait sessions with Magda Frstner, an aspiring actress, dancer, and cabaret singer. In this portrait Kertsz captured her expressive, playful persona in a moment of ecstatic abandon, with her head thrown back, chest pushed forward, and mouth open. Her satiny sleeves climb the walls like vines as she thrusts her arms heavenward in her reverie.
I went to [Piet Mondrian's] studio and instinctively tried to capture in my photographs the spirit of his paintings. He simplified, simplified, simplified. The studio with its symmetry dictated the composition. He has a vase with a flower, but the flower was artificial. It was colored by him to match the studio.-- Andr KertszDecades after this photograph was made, Andr Kertsz recalled the circumstances surrounding its creation. The composition is neatly divided in half: on the left is the intimate interior of the room in which Kertsz stood, showing Mondrian's straw boater on a peg and a table with the flower mentioned above. The vase perches precariously near the edge of the table, as if Kertsz moved it to include it in the photographic frame. On the right, seen through a doorway, the curving banister and stairs soften the profusion of right angles and straight lines in the foyer.
The photographer created a self-portrait out of his own shadow and that of his camera mounted on a tripod. The entire shadow is black except for the outline of his profile, which in its grayness becomes a mask, creating another layer of distance from his actual appearance. The faint curved line at the center is Andre Kertsz's cable release, the device that allowed him to trip the shutter while holding his right hand out of camera range. With his left hand he gracefully steadies the tripod. The door's hardware, in crisp focus in the upper left corner, balances the composition as a rectangular abstraction.
The rigid order of the identical volumes leaning on the shelf is interrupted by an intruding pair of hands, firmly gripping one of the spines as though removing it from the pack. The verticality of the ordinary, softbound volumes found in a bookshop on Paris's Left Bank is emphasized by the narrow vertical print, with the lower quarter of the sheet left blank and bearing the photographer's signature. Andr Kertsz was a lifelong lover of books and other printed matter and frequently incorporated themes of literary consumption in his work.The white highlights of shirt cuffs and book jackets glow softly, and the little finger on the left hand bends crookedly on the shelf, curiously suggesting some necessary pressure in the exertion of the task.
A man walks toward the camera carrying a newspaper-wrapped parcel. Overhead a locomotive train smokes through the sky on a viaduct. Men and women come and go on the narrow street, which terminates in a construction scene at the base of the elevated tracks.Is the village road open or being opened to through traffic, as the curving white path through the arch on the right might suggest  The train and construction represent progress and modernization and as such are encroachments upon the quaint neighborhood that Andre Kertsz photographed with his new 35mm camera. He froze the train in motion at exactly the moment when it was framed between the buildings.
While living in Paris as a young photographer during the 1920s, Kertsz became intrigued by still life, a motif that he continually returned to throughout his long career.Bowl with Sugar Cubesdemonstrates his interest in the compositional possibilities of layering basic geometric forms on top of one another--three rectangles in a circle (sugar cubes and a bowl) and a circle in a square (the bowl and the cropped printing paper). Visual sophistication is achieved through his adroit use of simple objects and dramatic lighting.
Made from the stairwell of Andre Kertsz's apartment at 5 rue de Vanves, Paris, this bird's-eye view of people and pets casting long shadows on the sidewalk is a spontaneous still-life composition. The arrangement of figures is haphazard, yet the bright ground and clean outlines in the upper right balance the weight of shadows and dark figures in the left corner. Each human figure wears a hat: some blend in with the clothing, others appear like dots on the ground. The shadow of the dog's body in profile and its curled tail presents a more animated view of the animal than does its actual body, which is seen on the right.
One day in 1932, I was standing in front of the Acadmie Franaise and decided to take a look at what was behind those massive gates. I noticed that, for the average French citizen, even the sight of this national institution was awe-inspiring. I simply became very curious and wanted to know what was behind that imposing facade. As I wandered farther and higher up in the building, I ended up in the huge attic...the clock was under the cupola. Its glass face with Roman numerals gave me this fantastic view onto the Pont des Arts with the Louvre behind it.--Andr KertszLooking at this photograph simulates a feeling of standing beside the photographer, looking out on a wintry Parisian cityscape. Through Andr Kertsz's careful juxtaposition, the clock's silhouetted Roman numerals and hands appear to align with various elements of the scene below. The V points to the statue's shadow, the IIII traps two pedestrians, the III rests atop magazine stands flanking the Seine, and the star shape on the clock's hand blocks the far end of a bridge crossing the river. Darker than anything else, the clock's numerals and hand appear to be cut out and collaged onto the print's surface, rather than a natural part of the scene.This photograph demonstrates Kertsz's strategic use of flat, foreground elements against a deep background to suggest a sense of space. But he became most well known for his bird's-eye perspective, which reflects his desire to photograph behind the scenes from unconventional viewpoints.
Kertsz was invited to create nude studies for the Parisian men's magazineLe Sourire(The Smile). He purchased three curved mirrors at a junk shop and worked with two models provided by the editor. Kertsz photographed the mirrors, which contorted the human form into fantastic, elongated shapes. These humorous photographic grotesques, made at the same time Pablo Picasso was painting oddly proportioned female bodies, also anticipate the work of modern sculptors such as Henry Moore.
The impenetrable faade of Rockefeller Center in New York dominates the frame of this photograph, filling the lower and right sides of the image with its cold, hard, modern lines. The other third of the composition belongs to the sky, in which a lone puff of white cloud hangs isolated like a cotton ball, holding sway against the force of the skyscraper. The brilliant white form is  lost  in this scene that is otherwise devoid of natural, spirited shapes. The cloud possesses an innate impermanence; it will be gone with the next gust of wind, blown along on its path to some other expanse of sky. Andre Kertsz's juxtaposition of the whimsical cloud and unforgiving architecture seems to emphasize his own sense of isolation; the photograph was made soon after he had emigrated from Europe.
At a drugstore on Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street in Greenwich Village, New York, Andr Kertsz encountered a workman's arm replacing a part on a ventilator. The disembodied arm, with its owner only very faintly visible between the upper blades, is dangerously caught in a circular guillotine, wedged between two of the menacing steel blades. The five ventilator petals dominate the frame like a strange metal flower, in contrast with the wavy grain of the surrounding unfinished wood. By focusing so closely on the detail of man and machine and enigmatically removing from the frame any information that would explain the circumstances, Kertsz created a mysterious image that raises many questions about its origin and meaning.
The passage of time is represented in this image by the prominent clock in the watchmaker's window in Greenwich Village. The clock face shows the precise time of two minutes past two o'clock, but the deep shadows that the watch hands cast upon its face create a double set of hands, conspiring to confuse the matter. Time seems to stand still on the quiet street with the abandoned wagon parked on the sidewalk, half out of the picture's frame. Breaking the frame, a figure begins to stroll into view; a blurred shoe visible at the lower left follows the long shadow that has fully entered the picture.
Photographing from the high vantage point of his apartment window on New York's Fifth Avenue, Kertsz silhouetted leafless trees against the snow in Washington Square Park. He released the camera shutter to perfectly capture two pedestrians in midstride through the wintry landscape, introducing an element of dynamism to the carefully constructed composition.
Luminous red and white currants provide perches for various species of insects, while others crawl and hover over the page. Moths, beetles, wasps, flies, a ladybird, and a caterpillar are set in rows. Jan van Kessel I was one of the first artists to create horizontally arranged drawings of fruits and flowers, giving structure to essentially scientific analyses of insects. Instead of a specific setting, he preferred to use a blank ground, which allowed him to arrange the insects and fruits according to shifting yet interconnected vantage points.Van Kessel probably made this tight drawing in the studio, based on close sketches from nature. He used bodycolor to show volume, as in the luminous, patterned wings of the moths. Transparent washes represent the light effects, cast from a light source that creates dark shadows along the right sides of wings and underneath the insect's bodies, lifting them from the ground. Van Kessel assembled these insects to emphasize each specimen's crisp shapes and markings.
Fernand Khnopff depicted the daughter of a composer friend on a porch before a closed door, with her tiny thumb catching the edge of her bow as she reaches into her coat. With this small gesture, Khnopff captured the child's vulnerability and uncertainty in facing the outside world. To further evoke a child's perception of a world scaled for grown-ups, he framed Jeanne Kfer's tiny body against the adult-sized door and tilted the floor ever so slightly.Jeanne is further isolated by the free, abstract brushwork in the reflective door window behind her. Typical for Khnopff, Jeanne is not warm and inviting but cut off in the shallow background, a fixed haunting gaze on her face.Khnopff became a popular society portrait painter in the 1880s, using elements that served him well as an avant-garde Symbolist painter: visual realism and a mood of silence, isolation, and reverie. He frequently posed his models leaning against a closed door, flattening the space and resulting in a meditative, hermetically sealed image.
This is one of twelve works that make up the series Midnight Reykjavik. It is made up of two photographic prints that were hand cut and then layered, one upon the other, and mounted between sheets of Plexiglas. By slicing into the prints' surfaces, Soo Kim added a surreal quality to the skeletal outlines of this urban environment, in which traces of nature such as trees and water improbably poke through interior spaces.Intrigued by reports of Reykjavk's compact scale and rich folklore, Soo Kim traveled to Iceland's capital city in 2005. After exploring the pedestrian friendly city, she selected a rooftop vantage point that provided access to condensed views of the brightly painted homes lining narrow streets and sweeping vistas of the surrounding mountains and sea. Adjusting the focus of her handheld 2 1 4-inch format camera, she rotated 360 degrees in a counterclockwise direction to create a loosely structured panorama. Taken at midnight during the summer solstice, the photographs introduce elements of uncertainty into a city that appears brightly lit but eerily still.

Draftsman, painter, and watercolorist Seth Eastman appears seated atop the inscribed rock, a proper gentleman in high collar and vest contrasted with the natural setting and primitive, cryptic carvings. Eastman had been commissioned to illustrate Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's monumental book,Historical and Statistical Information Respecting the History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States.Here Eastman collaborated with Horatio King, a local Taunton, Massachusetts,daguerreotypist, who made the photograph. Based on the information provided in this photograph, Schoolcraft concluded that the Native American inscriptions, which had been highlighted with white chalk so that they would show up more clearly in the photograph, dated from American prehistory.
This clock was one of the most popular models produced by the German workshop run by David Roentgen and Peter Kinzing. The case is covered with a simple maple veneer, while gilt bronzemountssymbolizing Time add decoration around the clock face: Chronos (Father Time) supports the clock dial, and the passage of the year is marked by the garland over the dial, with its flowers for spring, wheat for summer, grapes for autumn, and holly leaves for winter. The faces of day and night are shown around thefrieze, and the whole is crowned with a lyre, symbol of the sun godApollowho oversees the passage of Time. Although the clock once played a tune when it chimed, this movement no longer works.Several other existing clocks include a large gilt bronze statue of Apollo playing his lyre on the top; as there are holes on the top of the case, such a figure probably once adorned this clock too.Johann Wilhelm Weyl created the musical mechanism for this clock.
A medieval castle stands on a hilltop overlooking small buildings, ruins, and olive and cypress trees. This work depicts Massa, a town near Genoa on the northwest coast of Italy. The painting is particularly rich in details: the leaves of the trees shimmer, the buildings' edges are precisely delineated, and the plain clothing worn by peasants in theforegroundis carefully described. Leo von Klenze, who is primarily known as the chief architect and head of public works in Munich, was also an accomplished painter. Combining his talent for keen observation with an ability to improve upon nature, Klenze amended this vista of the Italian town by altering the castle's architecture, inserting a Roman aqueduct, and changing the location of the olive trees.
A youth sits despondently wrapped in his cloak, his head in his hand, on the interior of this fragment of an Athenianred-figurekylixor cup. An older, bearded man stands before him. The scene probably illustrates an episode from the mythicalTrojan War, the mission ofOdysseusto Achilles' tent after Briseis, his concubine, was taken from him. Upset by this offense to his honor, Achilles withdrew from the battlefield and sulked in his tent. During his absence, the Greeks lost badly in battle, so the Greek leaders sent a delegation to convince him to return. Even the wily Odysseus, however, proved unable to make Achilles return to battle; only the death of his companion Patrokles motivated Achilles to rejoin the battle.The outside of the cup shows a mythological scene--Herakles competing with the sons of Eurytos in an archery contest--and an everyday scene of athletes training.
ThePanathenaia, a state religious festival, honoredAthena, the patron goddess of Athens. Held every four years, the festival included athletic and musical competitions. Amphorae filled with olive oil from the sacred trees of Athena were given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. These amphorae had a special form with narrow necks and feet, and they received standard decoration, always in theblack-figure technique. The front showed Athena, the goddess of war, striding forth between columns and included the inscription  from the games at Athens.  The back depicted the event for which the vase was a prize.On this example, Athena is shown in the usual fashion, wearing a helmet and her snaky-edged aegis and carrying a spear and shield. Leading vase-painters decorated these prize amphorae, which were commissioned in large quantities by the state, and their work can often be differentiated by themotifthey used to decorate the shield of Athena. For example, the Kleophrades Painter always used the winged horsePegasos, as seen here. The back of the vase depicts the four-horse-chariot race, one of the most prestigious events in the games.
Scenes from several Greek myths run around the neck of this enormousred-figurevolute-krater, which was broken and reassembled from many fragments. On the front of the vase, the top row of decoration depicts a mythological battle against theAmazons. Much of this scene is missing, butHerakles, identifiable by his lionskin, grasps the hair of a fallen Amazon and prepares to deliver the fatal blow with his sword. The lower row shows excerpts of three Labors of Herakles: theLernean Hydra, Geryon, and the Apples of the Hesperides. The better preserved back of the vase shows the Amazons preparing for battle and a scene with Peleus and Thetis, the parents of Achilles.The complexity of the decoration and the scale of this vase are unusual. In fact, this is the only surviving volute-krater with two rows of decoration on the neck. At this time, Athenian potters worked in close proximity and painters were very aware of each other's work. A showpiece like this vase may have been a response to the Kleophrades Painter's main competitor at this time, the Berlin Painter, who had been producing large volute-kraters with onefriezeon the neck.
In the early 400s B.C., Greek vase-painters took a new interest in scenes drawn from daily life. Vases from this period often depicted groups of boys or youths engaged in their usual activities: school, athletic training, and courting. The panel on the shoulder of this Athenianred-figurekalpis, however, shows a group of youths in a moment of relaxation. Accompanied by their dogs, the youths are conversing, either leaning on walking sticks or sitting, while one leans forward to tie his sandal.The kalpis was a new vase shape in the early 400s B.C. The rounded profile replaced the older, more angular form ofhydria, or water jar. Early in his career, the Kleophrades Painter decorated the angular form of hydria, but he later switched to the kalpis. Other features, such as the depiction of a scene from everyday life and the type of ornament framing the panel, also suggest that this vase comes from the later phase of the Kleophrades Painter's career.
Scenes from the labors of the Greek heroHeraklesencircle the neck of this Athenianred-figurevolute-krater. On the front of the vase, Herakles' companionIolaosprepares to drive off the cattle of Geryon, while Herakles and the goddessAthenaprepare to attack the sleeping giant Alkyoneus. On the back of the vase, Herakles first subdues the Keryneian hind, then beheads theLernean Hydra, and finally wrestles theNemean lion. These excerpts are portrayed with humorous overtones; such a light-hearted approach corresponds well with the krater's role as a mixing vessel for wine and water at asymposiumor aristocratic drinking party.An intense red glaze covers the body of this volute-krater. Coral-red technique, an intentional red surface on a vase, was an unusual process used almost exclusively on cups and small vessels. Its use on a large vessel like this krater was extremely rare. The difficult technique used to achieve this red surface required precisely controlled firing conditions. Few potters appear to have been interested in this time-consuming and presumably expensive process.
In this sensitive portrait, a young woman, her face haloed by a cloud of hair, reclines on a chaise lounge and gazes languidly at the viewer. In contrast to the high degree of finish in his rendering of the head, Klimt treated the sitter's clothing and the back of the chair in a looser, more summary manner, highlighting the palpable emotional connection between sitter and artist.The young woman bears a noticeable resemblance to Sonja Knips, a Viennese socialite whose portrait Klimt painted during the same period. Both the painting and this drawing mark a major turning point in the evolution of Klimt's style. In their soft-focus handling, dreamlike atmosphere and pervasive eroticism, they reveal the influence of Symbolism, a key element in the art of the Vienna Secession, the avant-garde movement in which Klimt played a central role.The drawing is housed in a contemporary frame designed by the Wiener Werksttte, a collective of artists and designers with close links to the Secession. It is a fine example of Klimt's commitment to the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art).
Gustav Klimt's favored working practice was somewhat unorthodox: he employed a number of nude models who lounged around his studio striking spontaneous poses, which he captured with a few exquisitely economical strokes of chalk or pencil. Many such life studies remained independent works of art, but others inspired paintings.These sketches of a kneeling woman, her generous buttocks thrust toward the viewer and her luxuriant hair cascading around her head as if caught by a current of air or water, ultimately served as preparatory drawings for the foreground figure in Klimt's paintingGoldfish(now in the Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Switzerland). In the finished painting, the nude retains this pose but turns her head to gaze impudently over her shoulder; Klimt initially titled it  To my critics  in reference to the controversy over three highly erotic murals he painted for the University of Vienna which had been attacked by the conservative press. The fluid, stylized treatment of the model's body and hair, which verges on abstraction, suggests his enduring identification of women with water--unbounded, immaterial and elusive--a common motif in his work.Although this drawing served as a study for another work, Klimt seems to have considered it a work of art in its own right. Not only did he sign it, he also published a reproduction of the right-hand figure in the Vienna Secession periodicalVer Sacrumin 1902; faint red pencil marks--cropping indications for the photographer--frame the figure.The drawing is housed in a facsimile of a frame designed by Klimt himself, exemplifying his commitment to the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art).
In this imaginaryclassicallandscape, Christoph Heinrich Kniep conveyed nature's superhuman might as a huge waterfall dwarfing the antique figures relaxing below. Kniep enhanced the waterfall's visual impact by framing it with a shaded arch of massive boulders; his paper's immense size also emphasizes the cascade's force.Kniep spent most of his life in Italy, where he was influenced by the sun-drenched, idealized classical landscapes of his French predecessor Claude Lorrain. Yet Kniep overlaid Claude's legacy with the late 1700s concept of the Sublime, whose purpose was to inspire a noble and lofty awe by depicting powerful natural phenomena.Despite the drawing's large scale, Kniep rendered each element with a precision achieved, no doubt, by the  sharpening and resharpening of the best English pencils  that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had noted during their trip to Italy together in 1787 and 1788. Many of the detailed sketches Kniep made during the trip were the basis for his later, more finished, imaginary landscapes such as this one. Kniep's intense fascination with the vegetation is indicative of German Neoclassicists' burgeoning scientific interests.
An angry crowd of onlookers gathers to observe Pontius Pilate's sentencing of Jesus. Having questioned Christ and found him innocent, Pilate wanted to release him, but he gave in to the bloodthirsty mob clamoring for crucifixion. To emphasize his lack of responsibility for the decision, Pilate washed his hands in public. This scene occurs on the raised platform outside the courthouse, while soldiers hold back the crowds at the foot of the steps.Nikolaus Knpfer created a stage-like setting for the drama of the trial. The darkened foreground figures lead the eye upward to the platform where the dramatic forms of Christ and his tormentors stand silhouetted against the sky. The brilliant illumination of Christ's face and torso points to his focal role. While suggesting the teeming mob of onlookers with some sketchily drawn faces at the right, Knpfer mainly concentrated on a few foreground figures. Other characters, such as the carefree boy on the left playing with his top and the weeping woman outside the prison gates, add interest to the scene.
The sageSolonstands to the right against an unadorned section of the room. His humble dress, long beard, and admonishing gesture contrasts with the extravagantly dressed figure of the king who points dramatically at the riches before him. In this moralizing scene from Greek legend, the wealthy KingCroesuscalls an audience with Solon, an Athenian lawmaker and philosopher. After proudly displaying his immense wealth, the king asks Solon to name the happiest man he has ever met. Solon does not name Croesus, instead responding that he could call no man happy until his life was so judged at its end and that humble people were often more content than the wealthiest kings. This moralistic tale, extremely popular in 1600s Holland, reflected the culture's ambivalent attitudes toward wealth and consumption.Nikolaus Knpfer used light to draw attention to the confrontation between the two figures. King Croesus and his queen are bathed in a bright light that illuminates their exquisite finery, the white satin and gold tablecloth, and the succulent delicacies and gold wares on the table. Light also falls upon the solitary figure of Solon, accentuating his isolated position below in the stage-like setting. This composition's carefully planned design and lighting reveal Knpfer's interest in contemporary Dutch theater.
Under a brilliant, clear blue sky, a sense of stillness and abandonment prevails in this scene, reinforced by creeping vegetation, grazing goats, and lizards scurrying across a dirt path. Behind the ancient city of Pompeii, Vesuvius silently looms, its presence serving as a terrifying reminder of the havoc it wrought in A.D. 79, when the city and its residents were buried beneath its molten lava. Christen Schjellerup Kbke drew the architectural remains of the forum with sharp precision, giving the painting a sense of order and clarity. He added a sense of drama by intensifying the contrast between light and dark, painting the foreground fragments almost completely in shadow.Excavations of the buried city began in 1748 and continue to this day. Scholars and curiosity seekers came in droves to see the ancient ruins. Kbke was one of many artists to visit the site, where he made detailed studies. After returning to his native Copenhagen, he set to work on this painting.
Seen from a high vantage point, this panoramic view of a Dutch landscape seems to extend into a limitless distance. Sweeping clouds dominate the dramatic sky, emphasizing the low flat expanse of the land below. Patches of sunlight illuminate the water, trees, and buildings of a broad plain traversed by a winding river.Philips Koninck specialized in painting panoramic views of his native countryside. Although the view seems convincing, he composed this imaginary landscape from various raw elements of nature, playing with expressive lighting andperspectiveupon a natural stage. The view assumes a point of view high above the earth, which did not exist in the flat land of Holland.
With color and line, Philips Koninck integrated hiscompositionand encouraged spectators to journey into it. He began with the wedge of land in theforeground: rivers, road, and fields converge on both sides, then gradually lead the viewer into the distance. Koninck also created depth through aerialperspective: color and tone fade as space recedes. In contrast to many Dutch artists of the 1600s who exploited watercolor's brilliant, jewel-like hues, Koninck chose a softpaletteof buffs and browns, deep green, gray, and light blue. He also made extensive use of bodycolor, applying this opaque mixture thickly and loosely, particularly in the foreground. His gentlebackgroundblue and smokychiaroscuroeffects evoke the atmosphere of a bright but hazy day.In this extremely rare colored landscape drawing, Koninck achieved the expansive space and rich atmosphere of his panoramic landscape paintings. The flatness of the Netherlands inspired this landscape drawing, but the view is imaginary rather than topographic.
Vase-painters working in the Greek colonies in South Italy frequently showed scenes of theatrical performances. Phlyax plays, popular in the 300s and 200s B.C., were farces parodying the heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life. The term phlyax, which is used for both the play and the costumed actors, probably derives from the Greek verb  to swell  and finds its meaning in the actors' costumes. They wore a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus; any other garments necessary for the role were worn over this.This Gnathian waresituladepicts a phlyax moving to the right along a dotted ground line while looking back over his shoulder. The economical scene makes it impossible to know what play is shown, but the figure is meant to be an African.As well as decorating vases in thered-figure technique,Apulianvase-painters created a type of pottery that scholars call Gnathian ware. In this technique, artisans glazed the entire surface of the vase black, then painted on the figures in added colors. This type of pottery began around 360 B.C. and was very popular in the period from about 350 to 325 B.C.
The woman depicted on this small fragment of a vase probably represents one of theMuses, the goddesses of learning and the arts. She holds a lyre, a harp-like stringed instrument, and her posture suggests that she is seated. Richly dressed, this muse wears a mantle decorated with groups of three white dots over her dress, and her cloth headband is equally lavish. She also wears several pieces of jewelry: adiadem, earrings, a necklace, and bracelet. The care the artist took with the rich details of this scene was typical of vases created in the 300s in the Greek colonies in South Italy.The fragment comes from a large calyx-krater decorated in a technique that scholars call Gnathian. The painter covered the entire surface of the vase with a black glaze and then added his decoration over the glaze. The bright, wide-ranging colorpaletteseen on this fragment is typical of Gnathian pottery. Unusual, however, is the use of shading, as in the golden color on the upper side of the forearm, to suggest roundness.
The ancient Roman hero Mucius Scaevola thrusts his hand into the open flames and holds it there as the man he tried to assassinate stands over him, observing along with two guards. The artist showed the dramatic climax of an ancient tale: the Etruscan ruler Lars Porsenna condemned Scaevola to be burned at the stake for attempting to murder him while he besieged the city of Rome. The Roman's bravery so impressed Porsenna, however, that he set Scaevola free.The design is crammed with fanciful details, all intended as a model for a stained-glass window, one of a series on Roman heroes and heroines. The background shows the towers of Rome, which resembles a walled Renaissance town more than an ancient, classical city, surrounded by medieval siege engines. A heavily ornamented arch supported by a pair of robust columns frames the scene. Profiles of a king and an emperor decorate the coffered arch, while other vaguely classical motifs fill the arch, the sides of the columns, and the frieze along the base. The shield at the bottom remains empty except for the Roman numeralxxiii,perhaps signifying the twenty-third window in the series. The rest of the space could have been filled with further inscriptions.
By around 2700 B.C.,Cycladicsculptors had developed a form of carved figure that would become canonical: a reclining female with folded arms. The Kapsala type, named after a cemetery on the island of Amorgos, was the earliest of these canonical types.Kapsala figures tend to have slender and elongated proportions. In an effort to avoid breakage, the legs of the figure are only partially separated; the feet of this figure have broken off. Anatomical features such as arms are modeled three-dimensionally, whereas in later types, sculptors rendered this feature with incised lines. The Getty Museum's piece is unusually large for a Kapsala figure.
As three women made their way across a sun-dappled meadow, Heinrich Khn made this image from above and behind, combining a modernist's bird's-eye viewpoint with aPictorialistvisual sense. The bromoil transfer process transformed the print into a grainy, atmospheric image reminiscent of a drawing. The anonymous, faceless figures are reduced to masses of light and dark that seem to float across thecomposition. The greatest achievement of the photographer is to aim at great pictorial effect without adulteration. The photographer may not paint,  Khn wrote to Alfred Stieglitz. In this image he adhered to his own admonition, successfully combiningperspectiveand printing technique to render this pastoral scene.
A nude woman stands in aclassicalcontrappostopose facing the viewer, with one hand pointing down and the other holding a mirror. This pose suggests that Hans Kulmbach meant to depict theallegoricalfigure of Vanity.Relying only on line, Kulmbach created subtle gradations of light and shadow. His fine hatching emphasizes the play of light over the woman's body. Curving strokes convey the muscular strength of her legs, the swell of her belly and rounded breasts, and the shadows on her long arms. He also used a tight pattern of cross-hatching that seems to radiate from her figure to create the appearance of a darkerbackground. This tactic also has a three-dimensional effect, bringing her body further forward and thereby making her seem to step toward the viewer.
An executioner holds his sword aloft, ready to slice the baby, while one woman frantically grabs his arm, begging him to stop. Hans von Kulmbach showed the dramatic climax of the story in which the wise KingSolomonwas asked to judge between the claims of two women who had each given birth to a child at the same time. When one of the babies died, both women demanded the remaining infant. To determine the truth, Solomon ordered his guards to cut the living child in half and give a portion to each. The real mother then rushed forward to prevent the act, so that her child might be spared. Onlookers with beards and exotic headgear, looking much likeRenaissanceEuropean Jews, observe the scene, while the other mother points to her dead child lying at the foot of the stairs.In this design for a stained-glass window, Kulmbach sketched the scene with a brush and wash before reinforcing it with ink lines. After the artist had produced such a design, known as acartoon, a glass specialist then cut and painted colored glass in shapes and colors according to the design or painted the scene on colorless glass panels.
To secure the release of the prisoners on the left, a generous man hands a coin to an official holding a long rod. A guard unlocks the shackles from a man crouched on the ground, while two more wait to be liberated from the stocks. In the darkness above their heads a candle gleams brightly, contrasting with the desolatevignetteof the gallows in the upper right. The drawing shows one of the Seven Acts of Mercy described byChristin theBible, through which the righteous would be saved at the Last Judgment.Pieter Cornelisz. Kunst decided to eliminate the figure of Christ from the scene and to fill it instead with contemporary figures. Both the official and the kind stranger wear garments possessed by most middle-class merchants in the Netherlands in the 1500s: long overcoats shaped like a clergyman's cassock over a short tunic and hose. The artist also used clear gestures and facial expressions to silently convey thenarrativecontent. Hepreparedthis design for a stained-glass window.
The sea god Glaucus pulls aside his beard, revealingCupid'sarrow protruding from his chest. Looking up, he sees the maiden Scylla on a rocky cliff and pronounces his love for her.Laurent de La Hyre represented a romantic scene fromOvid'sMetamorphoses. Glaucus rises from the sea with an elegant, curling white beard, a muscular torso, and a scaly tail that unwinds among the reeds. Clad only in crumpled white and red drapery gathered around her waist, Scylla leans forward, gesturing with her hand. Behind her, Cupid looks ready to let loose another arrow. La Hyre used soft pinks in the sky and delicate hues of blue in the water, in contrast to the vivid green used for the reeds and foliage.The painting was intended as a design for a tapestry series woven by the Gobelins factories and representing the loves of the gods.
Diana and hernymphsrest and bathe after the hunt, their catch guarded by a loyal hound in an idealized landscape furnished withclassicalruins. As in his many other landscapes, Laurent de La Hyre rendered aromanticview of a river valley, a poetic setting for a nostalgic theme. Drawing from the work of Nicolas Poussin, La Hyre employed a peaceful classicalcomposition, an orderly recession into space framed by trees. To Poussin's antiquarian interests, La Hyre added Claude Lorrain's limpid light effects.Philippe de La Hyre, Laurent's eldest son, summed up his father'sacademicapproach:  His subjects were placed in a landscape or architectural setting, which he treated with perfection according to all the rules ofperspective, of which he had made a special study. Thus his works were in demand, and he himself was held in high esteem. In the late 1600s, the Gobelins manufactory wove the design of this painting, along withGlaucus and Scyllaand four other mythological designs by La Hyre, into a tapestry series on the loves of the gods.
In this simple yet dramaticcomposition, an angel leadsSaint Peterpast the sleeping guards, releasing him from King Herod's imprisonment on the night before his trial. Early Christians traditionally regarded the episode as symbolic of the coming deliverance of the Church from persecution.With its elegantly posed figures, carefully drawn drapery, and delicate combination of black chalk and brownwash, this scene epitomizes Laurent de la Hyre's refined, distinctive draftsmanship. Powerful lines representing supernatural light emanate from the angel and focus the viewer's eye on the two protagonists. Silhouetted against this brilliant light, Saint Peter's strong form resembles a three-dimensional statue. The bodies of the sleeping soldiers anchor the scene at the bottom, echoing the heavy, intersecting beams in the upper right.
Two street musicians fight, perhaps over a place to play their instruments. The man on the left, wearing a hurdy-gurdy slung around his shoulders, defends himself with a knife and the crank of his instrument. The man in the center hits him with a shawm, a precursor to the oboe, and squeezes a lemon into his eyes to determine the legitimacy of the old man's blindness. To the right, two more itinerant musicians laugh and grin, enjoying the fight. An anguished old woman grasps the top of her broom and watches from the left. She wears a pleading expression, as if begging them to stop their quarreling.The figures are compressed in a shallow space, pushed up close to the viewer to create a sense of claustrophobia and add to the immediacy of the scene. Georges de La Tour describes each character and his or her expression in great detail: rotting teeth, leathery skin, and wild, unfocused eyes. Different textures--fabrics, wood, hair and flesh--are minutely observed and realistically painted.
Gabriel Bernard de Rieux, the youngest son of an immensely successful financier, wears the robes of his office as president of the second Court of Inquiry in the Parliament of Paris. From a large tome held on his lap, he lifts a sheet of paper. Intending to declare the sitter's erudition, wealth, and status, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour placed de Rieux in his study, surrounded by fashionable and expensive objects. Behind him is a richly ornamental screen; on a table covered with blue velvet cloth are books, papers, and an inkstand with a quill pen. A globe stands next to the table and a Turkish carpet covers the floor. These objects identify the sitter as a connoisseur of fine and precious thing--like his father, whose considerable fortune de Rieux inherited the year this portrait was painted.This large, full-length portrait, still in its original, massive gilt frame, was assembled from separate sheets of paper laid on canvas and drawn entirely in pastel. The most sought-after portraitist of his day, La Tour worked exclusively in pastel, producing likenesses of the nobility and the wealthy middle class that were applauded for both their technical mastery and their astonishing verisimilitude.  In fact, one contemporary critic marveled that such a work as this portrait could be created using crayons.
. . . the clarity of the cold carnation of the old skin, the creases of the smile, the folds made by the passage of time; the powerful pleating of the forehead . . .The Goncourt brothers, influential art critics and collectors, were truly moved by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour's portrait of the director of the Acadmie Royale, Louis de Silvestre. Other painters and draftsmen had produced formal portraits of this important figure, but none captured de Silvestre as frankly and naturally as in this preparation for a more elaborate pastel, now in the collection of the Musee Antoine-Lcuyer, St. Quentin, France.De Silvestre appears in an unguarded moment without his wig. The scarf tied around his head suggests he is working in his studio. La Tour candidly recorded his 73-year-old subject's blood vessels, wrinkles, and moles, giving De Silvestre realistic human qualities that formal portraiture of the period did not often capture. He and La Tour were friends, which also contributes to the intimacy of the portrait. Made seven years before de Silvestre's death, this drawing strikingly conveys the physical effects of age.
A young woman, reclining on a pillow, turns toward a presumed visitor; her wide-eyed gaze, one of delight and anticipation. As she turns, her white gown falls away, revealing her upper torso. A soft light bathes her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes and also highlights the glossy sheen of her hair cascading down her left shoulder.Adlade Labille-Guiard used the delicacy of the pastel medium to capture the sitter's eroticism. Rather than depicting a specific individual, Labille-Guiard created this imaginary portrait to convey a moment of sensual awakening. This type of fanciful portrait became popular in France in the mid-1700s.
In this gentleallegoryof peace by Louis Jean Franois Lagrene, Mars, the Roman god of War, throws back the rich green bed curtains that frame the scene. As the drapery parts, the morning light spills in to reveal the form of the sleepingVenus, the Roman goddess of love. Mars gazes at her, utterly captivated by her beauty. Her love has tempered his fierce character, and his shield and sword lie abandoned on the floor. Echoing the lovers' bliss, a pair of white doves, symbolizing Peace, build a nest inMars'shelmet.Lagrene created his finest works, including this small, jewel-like painting, around 1770. The lavish folds of drapery, the delicate play of light over fabric and skin, and the rich, restrainedpalettecombine to create a captivatingly beautiful image.
Departing from his usual practice--making politically charged drawings of the slums of Paris--Maxime Lalanne made this quiet drawing as a sensitive study of the provincial French landscape. Imbuing the scene with subtlety by applying rubbed crayon to the slightly irregular surface of laid paper, he presented aRomanticview of the countryside, with attractive, mature trees, a gently meandering river, and a picturesque castle tower.A superb draftsman, Lalanne used his sketches to work out issues for his technical manual on sketching and as the basis for illustrations in journals and books.
Lallemant left his native Lorraine for Paris around 1601. Throughout the first quarter of the 1600s he was one of the city's most prominent painters. In addition to providing designs for prints and tapestries, he painted numerousaltarpiecesand other religious works. This drawing, which may represent one of the four Evangelists, demonstrates the artist's ability to fuse an expressive, earthy realism with elegance and monumentality. The bold use of black pen and whiteheighteningsuggests that the drawing served as a model for achiaroscurowoodcut, an early type of color printing.
From the 1660s, cylindrical casters with decoratively pierced covers became popular for sugar and aromatic spices. These casters would have held powdered sugar to be sprinkled over the food at table. Sugar was a relatively rare and therefore expensive commodity until the beginning of the 1700s, when trade with the West Indies, with its large sugar cane plantations, increased its availability.Notches on the sides of these casters indicate that they fitted into a surtout, an assemblage for condiments that formed part of an elaborate silver-gilt table service outfitted with numerous matching plates, serving dishes, and tureens. The casters are engraved with the crest of the prominent Howard family and thearmsof theOrder of the Garter.
Overcome with emotion, a young painter throws his brush and palette to the ground and falls on his knees before his model. The subject of this watercolor, an amorous couple, recalls the carefree and pleasure-filled themes of the earlierRococoperiod. The costumes and interior details make further reference to this period.After spending many years painting military scenes with panoramic views and dramatic skies, Eugne Lami turned his attention to bourgeois society. He began painting ceremonial scenes from court life, which provided festive and colorful material for his canvas. Lami spent the later years of his life making watercolors of historical events.
In a luxuriant park adorned with a monumental fountain, two couples perform a country dance, accompanied by the music of a rustic bagpipe. On either side, other couples play out the game of love in its various stages of anticipation, entreaty, and reward.Lancret's subject was an invention of the 1700s. Called afte galante, these paintings depicted a pastoral landscape peopled by elegant figures strolling, making music, or attempting to woo their partners. Participants of thefte galanteseemed uninhibited by the stiff conventions of formal society.Lancret's fluid brushstroke is evident in the shimmering highlights of the costumes and in the play of their opulent colors against the harmony of the landscape background. The painting's relatively large size suggests that it was commissioned by a prominent collector, possibly an aristocratic patron or member of the French royalty.
Using a delicate pattern of red chalk lines to illustrate the play of light on the folds of the two men's clothing, Nicolas Lancret portrayed an elegant courtier on the left and a flutist on the right. Black chalk strokes define the elements of emphasis: the rippling folds on their breeches and cloak and each man's little nose and mouth. White lines add touches of silvery highlights to the costumes. Like his idol and rival Jean-Antoine Watteau, Lancret particularly favored the effects of combining three colors of chalk in the technique known astrois crayons. Among the many artists who imitated the brilliant flickering style of Watteau's chalk work, Lancret mastered it best and developed it into a personal idiom, evolving strokes that were looser and more ethereal than those of Watteau.Lancret probably sketched the figures as a life study, not in preparation for a particular painting. Later, when he required a particular gesture or movement for one of his paintings, he would have referred back to his drawings.
This angel seems to hang suspended against the background, with outstretched wings, tilted head, downcast eyes, and the right arm pointing over its shoulder. The absence of other figures besides the lone angel makes it difficult for scholars to interpret its pointing gesture. They guess that the artist intended to use the design as part of a larger composition such as a painting or print.Mair Von Landshut used only black ink and whiteheighteningto create the stiff, flat folds of the angel's robe and the flying drapery beneath. Much of the heightening that probably once covered the angel's wings and clothing has suffered some surface damage and is now gone. Only traces remain to lift the fabric up out of the dark gray color of the background. With little light contrast left, the dark ink hatching therefore appears stronger than it would have originally.
In Giovanni Lanfranco's highly original design, a few large figures stand on a bit of ground in a wide open, receding space. Using a low viewpoint and dramatic foreshortening, Lanfranco depicted the figures as if seen from below, imbuing them with monumentality. The powerful composition communicated both to spectators standing far away and to viewers standing far beneath the painting.In the Old Testament story (Numbers 13:1-27), Moses sent spies into Canaan to determine whether the land bore fruit. Lanfranco depicted these spies as they returned, laden with grapes, pomegranates, and figs as signs of the plenty of the Promised Land. Laying the ample harvest at Moses' feet, they reported,  surely it floweth with milk and honey. In Catholic theology, the plentiful grapes of the Promised Land prefigured the wine served at the Last Supper. Appropriately, this picture andElijah Receiving Bread from the Widow of Zarephathflanked a painting of the Last Supper in the large Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the church of San Paolo fuori le Mura (Saint Paul's-without-the-Walls) in Rome. Six additional paintings by Lanfranco, all related to the Eucharist, also hung high on the walls of the chapel.
In Giovanni Lanfranco's highly original design, a few large figures stand in a shallow foreground space. Using a low viewpoint and dramatic foreshortening, Lanfranco depicted the figures as if seen from below, imbuing them with monumentality. The powerful composition communicated both to spectators standing far away and to viewers standing beneath the painting.In this Old Testament story (1 Kings 17:8-24), the poor widow of Zarephath nourished Elijah in the desert with bread baked from a supply of grain that Elijah had assured her would be miraculously renewed by God. In Catholic theology, the widow's bread prefigured both the bread served at the Last Supper and God's sustenance of each Christian's spirit through the sacrament of the Eucharist.Appropriately, this picture andMoses and the Messengers from Canaanflanked a painting of the Last Supper in the large Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the church of San Paolo fuori le Mura (Saint Paul's-without-the-Walls) in Rome. Six additional paintings by Lanfranco, all related to the Eucharist, also hung high on the walls of the chapel.
While the Madonna tenderly caresses her son Jesus and her nephew the infant Saint John the Baptist, the two children extend their arms toward each other, expressing both familial and divine love. Yet, because each of the boys tucks his nearer arm in toward his body, the composition remains open. The goldfinch held carelessly in the Christ Child's left hand symbolizes his future Crucifixion.This painting's small scale and sensitive, poetic intimacy contrast with Giovanni Lanfranco's more usual grand, illusionistic decorations. The painting's frame, a type that was often used in the Barberini Palace in Rome, hints at the picture's previous location. Lanfranco may have painted it for a private chapel owned by the Barberini, Pope Urban VIII's family and leading patrons of Baroque art in Rome in the 1600s.
This design for a circular stained-glass window commemorates the marriage between Bitzius Haller and Barbara Fluomann, members of prominent Swiss families from Bern. An inscription around the base of the roundel details the commission, while an empty scroll at the top provides room for other lettering. On the left side, above one coat of arms, a beehive supports the figure of a man covered with the family emblems and carrying a flail. The female figure on the right rests on another beehive above her coat of arms; she carries a distaff, a tool used for spinning. To produce a stained-glass window, patrons commissioned an artist to make a cartoon for the design. Once the patrons had approved this image, another specialist craftsman cut the glass in shapes and colors according to the design or painted the scene directly onto a colorless glass panel.
Dorothea Lange made this portrait study not as a social document but rather as a Pictorialist experiment in light and shadow, transforming a character-filled face into an art-for-art's-sake abstraction. This image bridges the two distinct phases of Lange's work: her early, soft-focus portraiture and her better-known documentary work of the 1930s.
Although he is standing in the midst of unrest, this San Francisco police officer appears fully composed. Dorothea Lange made this photograph of a labor strike while working with the economist Paul Taylor, who would become her second husband. Taylor was covering the General Strike of 1934 for the social welfare journalSurvey Graphic. At the time, most political discussions centered on labor issues, and artists like Lange felt compelled to get involved. Lange's interest in the plight of laborers began as she assessed the evidence of the Great Depression from her studio window. Late in life, Lange recalled that she could see the unemployed drifting about and pause as they wondered where to go next. She began making photographs outside her studio-of breadlines, labor demonstrations, and strikes like the one seen here. Though Lange said she initially  did not have the slightest idea  what she would do with images like this, she continued making them as a direct response to what she saw, eventually focusing entirely on what would become known as documentary photography.Gift of David and Marcia Raymond in honor of their father Paul Raymond
Though farm work is strenuous and exhausting, this photograph suggests that jovial camaraderie could sometimes relieve the strain of being in the fields. Work was hard to come by in the 1930s, and these laborers probably counted themselves lucky to have found a paying job picking cantaloupes in the Imperial Valley's hot, dusty melon fields. Strong shadows and dirt caked onto the flatbed truck's tires makes clear that it was both hot and dry the day Dorothea Lange made this photograph.
I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother . . . She told me her age, that she was thirty-two. . . . that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed.Dorothea Lange's poignant image of a mother and her children on the brink of starvation is as moving today as when it first appeared in 1936. Lange made six exposures of this striking woman, who lived in a makeshift shelter with her husband and seven children in a Nipomo, California, pea-picker's camp. Within twenty-four hours of making the photographs, Lange presented them to an editor at theSan Francisco News, who alerted the federal government to the migrants' plight. The newspaper then printed two of Lange's images with a report that the government was rushing in 20,000 pounds of food, to rescue the workers.Lange made this photograph while working for the Resettlement Administration, a government agency dedicated to documenting the devastating effects of the Depression during the 1930s. Her image depicts the hardship endured by migratory farm workers and provides evidence of the compelling power of photographs to move people to action.
When Dorothea Lange originally photographed J.R. Butler, she created a waist-length portrait; however, she cropped the image years later to create a direct human confrontation in which Butler's wide-eyed, earnest expression demands attention. As the President of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, Butler played an instrumental role in bringing the economic plight of tenant farmers and sharecroppers to the attention of landlords and the Roosevelt Administration. Farm owners responded with threats and evictions for the union leaders. Butler, whose every wrinkle reveals the hardships faced by tenant farmers, embodied the determination of workers who sought to effect change.
After picking produce from an expansive field farmed by machinery, this couple carries their harvest to a scale. Despite the weight of their baskets, these seasonal workers were paid miserable wages. Dorothea Lange made this photograph in 1938 near Tracy, California, a stopping place for migrant laborers looking for work. At the time, hundreds of migrants were arriving in California every day. Many of the new arrivals had been working as tenant farmers in the Midwest until they were replaced by machinery. Others were victims of the Dust Bowl-a period of severe drought that struck the Great Plains of the United States in the early 1930s. Donning a cowboy hat and a large bonnet to keep the sun out of their eyes, Lange's anonymous subjects are shown making their way to the scale in identical strides. Her sharply focused image was meant to record the conditions of migrant laborers, and to compel the government to institute reform measures.
Dedicated to using the camera toward social ends, Lange spent several years documenting Depression-era conditions. In her efforts to record the effects of the economic decline on migrant labor, Lange here focused on a western expanse dominated by Highway 54. Stretching deep into the distance through a seemingly desolate landscape, the road was one that many families took west on their exodus from rural dust bowl conditions in Oklahoma.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Clutching her lunchbag, this schoolgirl places her right hand on her heart to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Dorothea Lange made this photograph at the Raphael Weill School in San Francisco's Japantown. A few weeks after Lange captured this image, the U.S. government relocated this innocent girl, and thousands of other Japanese Americans, to desolate areas east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.The attack on Pearl Harbor, which marked the beginning of direct American involvement in World War II, triggered the rise of assaults on the Japanese in America. Lange's photograph speaks to a shameful part of America's history, when all persons of Japanese descent were forced into internment camps because of their supposed risk to national security. President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized these detentions as protection against espionage and sabotage.
Dorothea Lange made this photograph while working for the War Relocation Authority during World War II. The image is a poignant commentary on the internment of Japanese Americans shortly after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Authorized by President Roosevelt, internement was deemed necessary because of the claim that anyone of Japanese descent posed a threat to national security. Over 100,000 Japanese Americans were uprooted and moved to desolate areas east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.Lange probably made this picture at the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Mateo, California. At the  assembly center --a  racetrack where horse stalls had been converted into barracks--families spent weeks waiting to be sent further east. Evacuees were permitted to bring only those items they could carry. That one chose to include an American flag testifies to a genuine sense of patriotism.
A quality that the artist responds to is the only way to make a documentary photograph. A documentary photograph is not factual, per se. It carries the full meaning and significance of the episode or the circumstance or the situation that can only be revealed--because you can't really capture it--by this other quality.--Dorothea LangeDorothea Lange often sought out subjects whose lives were affected by government policies--including those whose occupations depended on America's efforts during World War II. She documented factory workers in Richmond, California, a booming harbor town near her home, where ships were being built twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.These two factory workers appear to be taking a break between shifts. The scarcity of their personal time is suggested by a parking meter, which reads  violation  and dominates the picture'sforeground. Although Lange captured a private moment between the lovers, her view of them is not sentimental. The image's relatively darktonalrange underscores an ominous quality--in part suggested by the man's tight grip around the woman's neck--and the stark backdrop of factory buildings in the distance. Lange's low camera angle also isolates her subjects from their surroundings.
With a fur jacket draped over her shoulders, this woman appears strangely overdressed for broad daylight-and for the casual Richmond Caf behind her. During World War II, Richmond, California was home to the largest and most productive enterprise of the war, the Kaiser shipyards. Shipyard employees could work any one of three 8-hour shifts per day. Night shift workers sought typical evening activities during the day, which may explain this young woman's somewhat flamboyant attire. This is one of many photographs of Richmond that Dorothea Lange, along with photographer Ansel Adams, made forFortunemagazine, which wanted to document life in the wartime boomtown.
If you run out of money here in Gunlock, you can go and pick yourself something out of the garden.The security of this woman's environment is reflected in this statement, made to Dorothea Lange while she was producing a photo-essay forLIFEmagazine. Gunlock, an isolated Mormon community of twenty-two families, was one of three villages in Southern Utah that Lange photographed in collaboration with Ansel Adams. Lange, who posed this young woman with and without her son and canning fruit in her kitchen, described the small town as  full of friends and horses and children. Although none of the images of this Utah mother appeared in LIFE, Lange did include her inThe American Country Woman, a portfolio she prepared in the 1960s, and in a book on the theme published posthumously. Thirty-four images by Lange and Adams, with text written by Lange's son, Daniel Dixon, were published in the September 6, 1954 issue ofLIFEmagazine.
Lange believed that photographs should be made  not to show how great we are, but to show what it's like.  In 1954 she undertook an assignment for a photographic essay forLifemagazine and spent two months in the Irish countryside documenting the bleak life of the inhabitants of what the magazine dubbed the  land of the devout.  Facing her subject head-on, Lange centered her Rolleiflex camera on the schoolgirl under natural lighting conditions. The neutral background enhances the sustained intimacy of the portrait. The girl's intense gaze seems to confront both the photographer and the viewer.
The piercing gazes of two Middle Eastern women must surely have struck Dorothea Lange when she made this photograph, just as they strike the viewer now. The powerful expressions of both women are evident, though one covers her face with a veil. Lange understood that blankets, veils, and scarves could modify one's appearance, punctuate one's actions, and emphasize emotional moments. She exploited this device throughout her career, particularly in her photographs of women. She photographed Native American women wrapped in blankets, elderly Irish women wearing black shawls, and veiled Middle Eastern women like those seen here.
This daguerreotype portrait of Frederick Langenheim by his brother and studio partner, William, displays a masterful control of light. The fine detail reveals even the minute check pattern of Frederick's vest and the subtle striping of his topcoat. He sits quietly, looking directly into the camera and holding what appears to be a closed daguerreotype case in his hands.Daguerreotypes were very delicate and the image could be scratched rather easily, so they were frequently mounted behind a glass and mat in a velvet-lined case. The Langenheims may have used this accomplished portrait in their studio window display to entice potential customers. The embossed word  Exchange  on the case lining indicates the street where their Philadelphia studios were located.
The success of this extraordinary bridge is now to be considered an established fact. The trains of the New York Central, and of the Great Western Railroad in Canada, have been crossing regularly since the 18th of March [1855], averaging over thirty trips per day. . . . The great rivers of this continent will no longer offer an insurmountable obstruction to the formation of uninterrupted lines of railways.John August Roebling's comments make clear that he was proud of having designed and engineered the Niagara Railway suspension bridge, the first bridge of its type in the world. After its completion, photographers like the Langenheim Brothers flocked to Niagara to document the achievement in compelling ways. This stereograph shows a locomotive passing over the bridge while the still, scenic river barely ripples below.Roebling's prophecy about future railways proved true. More daring and innovative constructions soon facilitated trains crossing the great rivers of the United States. Photographers followed, documenting the achievements in lavish detail.
Although entitledCathedral, Baltimore,this stereograph focuses on the isolated individual in theforeground, not on the barely visible towers of the cathedral. In highlighting the figure of an anonymous African American man, the artist may have been alluding to Baltimore's role as a haven for freed slaves in the pre-Civil War era.
In a famous, perhaps apocryphal story meant to illustrate the great ruler's generosity, the court painter Apelles fell in love with Alexander the Great's favorite concubine Campaspe while sketching her. As a mark of appreciation for the painter's work, Alexander gave her to him as a present. In this scene Apelles responds to his master with enthusiasm and gratitude, while Campaspe modestly clutches her drapery and gazes at the floor.Jrme-Martin Langlois made this highly polished drawing in preparation for a painting that achieved great success at the ParisSalonof 1819. Using nearly invisible strokes, he expressed the varied textures of leopard skin and marble walls under a clear, cool light. As with manyNeoclassicalFrench painters, Langlois chose aclassicalsubject and an austere setting as a moral lesson for his own time.
Set against a darkenedbackgroundbeneath an archway, two soldiers flagellate the figure ofJesusChristtied to a column. Christ looks down sorrowfully as the two men prepare to strike him with bundles of sticks.To create the startling effects ofgrisaille, Bernardino Lanino produced this dramatic monochromatic scene using black chalk and whitebodycoloronpreparedpaper. Deftly handling the point of a fine brush to apply a system of whitehighlights, he indicated both the lighting and the volume of the forms with a delicate network of hatching and cross-hatching. Numerous fine lines suggest the wiry ringlets in Christ's hair, the delicate fabric of the loincloth, and the muscular texture of the bodies. The figures seem to stand out in glowing three-dimensionalreliefagainst the darkness of the inky background.
Ornament in the earlyNeoclassicalstyle, such as ram's heads, triglyphs, and guttae, overlay this clock case and its supporting bracket. The flaming urns, swags, and Greek key fretwork were allmotifscommonly used in thegot grec(Greek taste).The use of horn veneer painted red, green, and cream seems to be unique among French clocks and furniture; it may have been an attempt to imitatecloisonnenamel on Chinese bronzes.
Dressed in a fanciful Roman costume, a young boy with blond hair and blue eyes poses before an enigmatic landscape. Facing frontally, he twists his torso in order to hold and stroke his dog. Both the boy and the animal watch a goldfinch with outspread wings perched on a thornbush. Although the young sitter's identity is unknown, he is presumed to be a member of the French royal family.Nicolas de Largillire positioned his figure before an atmospheric landscape and used fluent brushwork, rich autumnal colors, and exquisite treatment of draperies. All these characteristics betray his training in aFlemishlateBaroquestyle heavily indebted to Anthony van Dyck.The inclusion of elaborate symbolism also reflects a Baroque sensibility. The child's costume refers to nobility, his pet dog to fidelity, and the thornbush to the Crown of Thorns. Through an extended series of connections, the goldfinch functions as a symbol of the Passion: goldfinches eat seeds from the thorny thistle, another reminder of the Crown of Thorns, and the red spot on their breast is a further reminder of Christ's bloody death.
French craftsmen at Svres designed these vases to hold flowering plants and soil in the upper trumpet-shaped section. Water, added through openings in the lower base, fed the plants through small holes pierced near the base of the soil container. The two separate sections permitted easy removal of plants or excess water.The Svresporcelainmanufactory produced this design in five different sizes. Immensely popular, these vases sold in large quantities up until theFrench Revolution.
The Svres porcelain manufactory produced numerous plates with a wide variety of decoration, either as matching sets or as part of dinner or dessert services. This example, however, is one of a small number of individually decorated plates intended for display rather than use. The gilding is more finely detailed and the floral reserves more delicately painted than normal. The reddish-brown ground flecked with gold was also experimental and was apparently not used for any other service.Svres may have sold sample plates like this one as collector's items or for presentation to favored clients.
...light that turns the otherwise familiar sceneto the hand-tinted postcards of a dreamLike this excerpt from a poem by Eleanor Wilner, this photograph captures the harshness of the Arizona sun at noon and the peculiar clarity of the desert light. While a visiting professor at the University of Arizona, William Gary Larson took a series of such photographs of human habitation in the surrounding desert. Wilner wrote her poem in response to the photographs, and Larson in turn named the photographs the  Tucson Gardens  pictures after her poem.
And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow. And for fear of him the guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men.The use of light and shade, saturated colors, and bold gestures dramatically capture the drama of theResurrection, so vividly recorded in theBible. Famous as the teacher of Rembrandt, Pieter Lastman brought a direct, emotional conviction to religious themes in his native Amsterdam in the early 1600s.InThe Resurrection,Lastman emphasized the expressive power of the miracle taking place, contrasting divine light with the doom of the unredeemed. An angel gently lifts the heavy lid from the tomb asChristascends to heaven surrounded byputti. Bright light from Christ'shaloilluminates the standing angel and throws into shadow the standing soldier with upraised arms, outlining his bright red costume. A terror-stricken soldier sprawls on the ground with his head thrown back and his arm raised as if to ward off a blow. To the right, a turbaned man shields his eyes while a soldier in a plumed hat sleeps. In thebackground, rays from the rising sun light the approach of the three Marys.
Pieter Lastman used the red chalk medium to create a highly detailed rendering of a kneeling man in a tiny space. Known for his ability to model in depth, Lastman also manipulated his lines to animate the varying textures, from the man's curly hair to the sinuous line of his large hands to the soft modeling of his heavy robe. The carefully worked drapery with elaborate folds and deeply shadowed long grooves is characteristic of his style. He gave the man eloquent hands and expressive eyes that look upward, encouraging the viewer to construct anarrativelike those in the artist's manyhistory paintings.
This miniature originally appeared in a manuscript expressly created for Philip the Good, the duke of Burgundy that consists of a compilation of accounts of the miracles of the Virgin Mary. Philip was a highly successful political leader of his day as well as an important and influential patron of manuscript illumination. The witty scene illustrates a noblewoman's endeavor to deal with her husband's Christian mistress. In the chapel at right, the wife of the adulterous knight prays for the Virgin Mary to avenge her by punishing the mistress. However, Mary refuses the request on account of the adulteress's deep devotion to her. Subsequently when wife and mistress encounter one another in the street the mistress is so embarrassed--she falls to her knees--she promises to give up the husband. Meanwhile the wayward husband cowers behind the chapel. Given the duke's own serial philandering--he fathered several dozen children outside his marriage and relatively few within it--one cannot help but wonder how he responded to this moralizing tale.The miniature is painted entirely in grey tones, a technique called grisaille, popular in the later Middle Ages. Despite the lack of color, the illuminator, Lieven van Lathem, vividly evokes the buildings and cobblestone streets of a prosperous Netherlands town such as Ghent where van Lathem, the court painter of Philip the Good, resided.
This diminutiveprayer book, measuring about five by three and one-half inches, engages the viewer in intimate contemplation of both its text and its images. The book contains Latin prayers devoted toChrist, the Virgin, and the saints and is remarkably embellished with thirty-seven largeminiatures, several smaller miniatures, and decorations on every page. The largest miniatures measure only about three inches on the longest side, but they are incredibly detailed, often with deep panoramic landscapes framed by lush borders.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and son of bibliophilePhilip the Good, saw many of his father's unfinished book commissions through to completion; this prayer book is one of the rare commissions Charles initiated himself. The accounts of the Burgundian dukes record payments in 1469 to the scribe Nicholas Spierinc of Ghent, to theilluminatorLieven van Lathem of Antwerp, and to the goldsmith who made the original clasps for the binding of this costly book. Along with Lathem, several anonymous illuminators collaborated on this project, including the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy. In the 1480s, a series of additional prayers with miniatures by a French illuminator was added to the volume.
Before a deep landscape of a vast river valley stretching off into the distance, Saint Michael strides into battle against a monstrous army. With his cape blowing behind him and a foot on the back of one demon, Saint Michael waves his sword overhead while fending off another demon with his shield. In the sky above, more demons fly in to attack amid storm clouds. According to the Apocalypse, Saint Michael is the archangel who will banish the devil at the end of time. At the top of the miniature, in a heavenly realm glowing with light, angels hold aloft an empty throne destined for the Messiah at the end of time.The illuminator Lieven van Lathem used the border to amplify the theme of the main scene. Here fantastic beasts frolic; similar to those in the miniature, their confrontations mimic the miniature's battle theme.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and a military leader, expressed his devotion to Saint Michael by including a suffrage prayer to him, prefaced by this miniature, in his personal prayer book.
With closed eyes indicating that he is in the midst of a vision,Saint James the Greatersits in a boat whileJesustells him to go to Spain to preach. The boat not only refers to his imminent journey but also presages one further in his future. After preaching in Spain, James is said to have returned to Judea, where he was decapitated; his head, set adrift in a boat, miraculously washed ashore in northwestern Spain, where it was then buried and forgotten. Its later rediscovery heightened interest in the saint, and hisrelicsattracted many Christian pilgrims. In theminiatureJames holds a staff, a symbol of pilgrimage to the site of his relics at Santiago de Compostela, Spain. This image prefaces asuffrage, or prayer, to Saint James the Greater. The scene is set in a deep landscape, in which a meandering river connectsbackgroundandforeground. In the distance, fortified castles dot a hill while boats sail near a harbor. TheilluminatorLieven van Lathem harmonized this landscape with the green and blue border that encloses the whole page. In contrast to the cool colors, James stands out in his bright red garment.
Saint Anthony looks up from his prayer book and rosary to see a beautiful woman offering a chalice. Anthony Abbot withdrew to the Egyptian desert in the 300s to live a hermit's life. According to his biographer, Anthony endured many assaults from the devil in the form of seductive and horrible visions. Here theilluminator, Lieven van Lathem, presented the saint's desert retreat as if it were situated outside a prosperous Flemish town of the 1400s, while the alluring woman is shown in fashionable attire of the time. Anthony wears the black robe of the order ofHospitallers, which took Saint Anthony as its patron saint. Given a papal dispensation that allowed their pigs to roam freely in medieval towns, the order took on the animal as itsemblem. In thisminiaturevan Lathem has depicted a pig at Anthony's side.
Within a deep landscape, saints approach from every direction. Ecclesiastical saints and kings stand on the left: Saint Jerome wears a cardinal's outfit and his lion crouches at his feet. The elderly hermit saints Anthony Abbot and Paul sit against rocky boulders on the right. In the middle ground, military saints in full armor ride gracefully along the center path, while behind them, female saints make their way down a hill at the right just as monastic saints do on the left. In the middle distance stands a draped cross surmounted by the lamb of God. In the semicircle at the top of the miniature, God the Father, crowned, enthroned, flanked by angels, and surrounded by saints, holds Jesus' dead body upon his lap.In traditional representations of All Saints, the figures stand virtually undifferentiated in a row. The illuminator Lieven van Lathem broke with this tradition by dividing them into groups and setting them within a landscape. His creation of this deep panoramic landscape in an area of only three-by-two inches testifies to his exceptional skill. The miniature prefaces a prayer dedicated to All Saints.
The Virgin Mary offers her breast to the infant Jesus as her mother, Saint Anne, reaches toward the child. Episodes from the story of the conception of the Virgin appear in the background. In the distance, the Virgin's father Joachim tends his sheep in the countryside. An angel, rendered by just a few strokes of red paint, appears to him and tells him that his elderly wife will conceive a child. Upon hearing the news, he returns to Jerusalem. Joachim and Anne embrace before the gate to the city in the middle ground at right. The artist, Lieven van Lathem, tied the elements of the narrative together by showing the figures in the same clothes at each appearance and by carefully modulating the recession of the landscape into the distance.
According to medieval legend, Saint Margaret was an early Christian convert who was tortured and put in jail when she refused to renounce her Christian beliefs. While in jail, she prayed to God to show her the enemy who was fighting her, and a great dragon appeared and swallowed her whole. While inside the beast, Margaret made the sign of the cross, at which point the dragon's belly burst open and she emerged unscathed. This image of Margaret rising unharmed from the belly of a dragon accompanies the suffrage of Saint Margaret. A golden cross appears above Margaret's clasped hands, a symbol of her faith and a physical representation of the sign she made while inside the dragon.Saint Margaret was a popular saint in the Middle Ages, often invoked by women in childbirth. According to her legend, just before her death by beheading, she prayed that any woman faced with a difficult labor who invoked her aid would give birth to a healthy child, just as she herself was safely delivered from the belly of the dragon.
In this intimate book of hours, the miniature of the Entombment introduces the service of Compline in the Hours of the Passion. Before a deep, receding landscape background, Jesus' followers, including two richly clad gentlemen, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, place his limp body in a sarcophagus. Kneeling, Mary Magdalen reverently leans over to kiss Jesus' hand. On the other side of the sarcophagus, the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist also mourn. Expanding the meaning of the central scene, the artist included in the border on the lower left the Old Testament episode of Jonah swallowed by the great fish. This episode which was understood as a prefiguration of Jesus' Entombment; just as Christ rose after three days in the tomb, Jonah emerged unharmed after three days in the belly of the fish.
This elaborate timepiece demonstrates the level of astronomical knowledge of eighteenth-century French scientists. The large main dial is composed of overlapping circular plates and three hands that indicate the time with a twenty-four hour chapter ring, the months of the year and their zodiacal signs, the days of the lunar month, and the local time in various cities and parts of the world, includingLa Californie.The four smaller dials grouped above show the phases of the moon, a tidal calendar for the ports of Northern France, the days of the week, and the times of the eclipses ofJupiter'sfirst moon, Io. On the top of the case, a gilt-wood orrery shows the relative positions and motions of bodies in the solar system.Very few such elaborate clocks have survived to the present. Unfortunately this clock is no longer in working condition as the movement is entirely missing.
The  wave pattern  of the woodveneerechoes the curving lines of the gilt-bronzemountson this commode. In this extremely difficult process, veneers were cut at an angle through a piece of wood to produce ovals and then carefully placed so that the wood grain formed waving lines.Although the commode is not stamped with a cabinetmaker's name, scholars are certain that it was made by Jean-Pierre Latz because his stamp was found on a commode of the same design in the Palazzo del Quirinale, Rome. That commode was part of a group of furniture that the French princess Louise-Elisabeth, elder daughter ofLouis XV, brought with her when she and her husband, Don Philippe de Bourbon, came to Italy to rule Parma and Piacenza.
Anbnisteused various brilliantly colored exotic woods and stained native woods to create the floralmarquetryon the doors of these corner cupboards.bnistesspecializing in this type of work, such as Jean-Franois Oeben, sometimes sold such panels already made and ready to be glued onto a piece of furniture.Oeben used the grain of the wood to create the effect of movement in a leaf or a petal. Tulips, carnations, roses, lilies, and daffodils are recognizable in hisnaturalisticbouquets. Elaborategiltbronzemountsof interlaced flowers and branches, designed by a specialized sculptor and made by a bronze caster, set off the marquetry panels.
Amidst swirling draperies, Saint Joseph holds the infant Jesus upon a tasseled cushion. Joseph is modeled with subtle twists in his body, amplified by his buoyant and billowing tunic and cloak. Even his curly hair flutters with a life of its own. Fashioned from white-bodied earthenware, known as creamware, the figures are painted with lustrous jewel-like colors. Their theatricality is characteristic of Baroque sculpture.Athough most depictions present Saint Joseph as elderly, he is portrayed here as a youthful and handsome father. Inspired by the new focus on Jesus' human and family life and encouraged by the philosophies of the Counter-Reformation, the cult of Saint Joseph became more popular in the second half of the 1700s, when this sculpture was made.The subject and composition of this work are identical to those of a life-size marble of 1790 to 1791 by the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino in the Taranto Cathedral. Sanmartino produced a number of terracotta sketches for his large-scale sculpture; this small-scale ceramic group by Gennaro Laudato probably copied one of these and was intended as a collector's object or devotional piece.
In great sadness yet trusting in imminent salvation, a young child raises his eyes to heaven. The half-length figure rises from an ovalplinthand grasps a palm and a laurel branch in one hand. Conventional signs of martyrdom and victory over death, the branches help identify the figure as the infant Saint Cyricus. In 304 this Roman toddler was martyred at the age of two and a half years, along with his mother Saint Julitta, a Christian who refused to pray to  false idols.  According to legend, Saint Cyricus endured brutal tortures: sawing in half, flaying, and boiling in a cauldron. These episodes may have inspired both the unusual half-length form of this representation and the oval plinth, which recalls the shape of a cauldron. Francesco Laurana combined traditional symbols of sainthood such as the palm and laurel branches, specific references to the saint's life story, and a remarkablenaturalism, making the work all the more moving by suggesting the horror of tortures perpetrated upon a helpless infant.
In Hanns Lautensack's imaginary city, the upward sweep of the pointed architecture echoes the towering mountains' vertical lines. The artist applied the white highlights economically, creating a sparkling effect on the dark red prepared paper. The brilliant whites also suggest nocturnal illumination, heightening the drama of this otherwise static scene.Either in the background of a composition or as the subject itself, landscape played a important role in the works of a group of draftsmen known as the Danube School. These artists from the southern part of Germany then known as Bavaria focused on prominent elements in their native landscape, such as mountains and trees, as embodiments of nature's superhuman power.
The French kingLouis XVpresented Germain-Louis Chauvelin, his Keeper of Seals, with this tapestry, originally one of a set of ten. Known as aportire, it would have hung across the door of a formal room to keep out drafts. Its prominent heraldic symbols would have clearly announced to visitors the importance of its owner and royal donor. Displayed under a gilded and tasseled canopy, the royalcoat of armsappears against an ermine-lined mantle. The arms rest upon a gilt metal box decorated with fleur-de-lis and L's, the king's initial, representing the casket for the royal seals. The tapestry's wide border contains crossed maces, attributes of the keeper of seals; Chauvelin's monogram of interlaced C's; and his coat of arms in the four corners.Around 1680,Louis XIVbegan a tradition of presenting his chancellor or his keeper of seals with a set of tapestries from the Gobelins tapestry manufactory. A powerful figure in the 1600s and 1700s, the keeper of seals acted as minister of justice and was second in command to the chancellor of France. The chancellor represented the person of the king, interpreted the royal will, and headed the judicial system. Chauvelin accepted the tapestry set around 1730, at the height of his career.
The arms ofLouis XV, who came to the throne as a five-year-old in 1715, announce this tapestry's royal origin and purpose. Under the head ofApollo, from whom the sun's rays emanate, a large crown tops a simulated bronze cartouche. Within the cartouche, the three fleurs-de-lis symbolize the arms of France, hanging in the center of an ermine cloak flanked by two military trophies. Suspended medals hang below, in front of the crossed scepter and the  hand of justice,  symbolizing the king's legal power. A royal ceremonial helmet at the bottom seems to rest upon another military trophy. The tapestry's color and design were new, but its celebratory purpose and the specific imagery harked back to the symbols ofLouis XIVfrom the previous reign.The Gobelins tapestry manufactory wove twenty-eight examples of this tapestry over a period of about fifteen years. One of theseportiresdecorated the door of a salon atVersailles, others hung in several of the royal chteaux, and French ambassadors used several to decorate their embassies.
Arms thrown wide, Saint Andrew implores the heavens above while soldiers tie him to a cross in the shape of an X. His executioner, the Roman governor Egeas, watches from aclassicalporch above, and confusion reigns as soldiers try to push back the surging crowd. Charles Le Brun heightened the emotion of the figures by contrasting the stern, silent figure of the emperor with the chaos below. He used gesture, facial expressions, and strong colors to create a dynamiccompositionin the theatrical Roman setting.This painting is directly related to a largealtarpieceby Le Brun commissioned in 1646 by the Goldsmith'sGuildfor thecathedralof Notre-Dame in Paris. The altarpiece was one of the annual commissions known asLes grands Mays,which were installed in the cathedral on the first day of May in honor of theVirgin Mary.
These panels, along with others now lost, were probably once incorporated into the walls of a distinguished private residence. They correspond closely in style to similar panels in the Chteau ofVaux-le-Vicomtenear Paris; one is painted with precisely the samemotifsas those on a panel that still remains in one of the king's state rooms (now the library).Charles Le Brun was responsible for the decoration of Vaux-le-Vicomte, the grand chteau built forNicolas Fouquet, minister of finance in the early years of the reign ofLouis XIV. The panels were designed in the elaborate lateBaroquestyle developed by Le Brun for interiors in the mid-1600s. The four largest panels contain oval paintings ingrisailleof seated women inclassicaldress representing the fourCardinalVirtues: Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice.
Although scholars know nothing about the sitter Monsieur Quatrehomme, they believe that his relaxed pose and casual dress indicate that he may have been a friend of the artist. Charles Le Brun built up the drawing slowly, first sketching the figure in red chalk, withpentimentivisible along the outside of the right arm. He worked the body mainly in black and white chalk, applying pastel more freely in the hand holding the book and in the loose folds of drapery spilling over the left arm. The artist drew the face and hair more tightly, carefully showing the sitter's furrowed brow and the dark shadows under his eyes.Lebrun's choice of pose infused vitality into a rather static portrait. Quatrehomme gazes intently to the left, while his hands holding the book sweep to the right, creating a sense of movement. Theilluminationcoming from behind the sitter's head also reinforces the outlines and brings a sculptural clarity to the form.
This is one of a series of twelve tapestries, which each showed an astrological sign for a month with a French royal palace in thebackground. The month of December shows the Chteau of Monceaux (demolished in 1799, during theFrench Revolution) through the bare trees. On the left,Louis XIVleads a hunting party with horsemen and hounds after a wild boar. In the center of the top border, the astrological sign of Capricorn hangs between garlands of winter fruit and vegetables. In theforeground, two liveried pages drape a rareNear Easterncarpet over thebalustrade, while a moorhen, crane, and bustard, birds from the royal menagerie, strut along the front.
Look closely at the brilliantly illuminated white trees on the left of the image. High upon the right side of the tree trunk is a marker for tourists, who would have been following a carefully prescribed guidebook path through the Forest of Fontainebleau. In the mid-nineteenth century, the forest was an extremely popular destination for artists, especially theBarbizon Schoolof landscape painters, as well as vacationing Parisians. The image's only direct light seems to seek out this human intrusion, somehow vindicating the notion that the experience of nature requires instructions. This view may, in fact, be the other side of Gustave Le Gray's photographThe Road to Chailly, Fontainebleau; the clearing here in the distance suggests that Le Gray was not far from such a road.When Le Gray made this photograph in the 1840s, the chemistry of the photographic negative was not sensitive to the color green, so the foliage appears darker in the photograph than it would have in real life.
The relatively large number of existing prints of this oddly shaped oak tree suggest that this was one of Gustave Le Gray's most popular forest views. The tree was a well-known curiosity amongBarbizonpainters, who lived at the edge of the forest at Fontainebleau--outside Paris--and who painted pure,naturalisticlandscapes. Le Gray captured the fine details of the tree's bark and the soft moss covering a boulder at the foot of the tree, contrasting the tree's rough texture with that of velvety moss.
Looking out from Le Gray's photograph, Victor Cousin appears intent on being seen as serious, though perhaps he was simply suspicious of the process that fixed his image for posterity. A popular, influential professor and lecturer and later a reforming government minister, the distinguished philosopher must be considered one of Le Gray's most eminent sitters.Cousin was well into his sixties when this photograph was made, and his somewhat disheveled appearance advertises his status as an elderly bachelor. His clothing is wrinkled, and patterned fabric untidily extrudes between his vest and trousers. The hand tucked dramatically into his vest hides the lens of his monocle, with the cord barely visible underneath. Through retouching the negative, Le Gray tried to simplify Cousin's silhouette by eliminating the back of the chair on which he sat; its traces remain, however, interrupting the otherwise smooth line of the right shoulder.
Gustave Le Gray recognized that this bleak factory was a highly unusual subject. Heavy industry was rarely amotiffor photography in the mid-1800s. Rather than shying away from it, however, he masterfully recorded the blackened foreground and spreading clouds of smoke that veil the deforested hillsides. Le Gray made this picture at Terre-Noire (Black Earth) in central France, an area rich in coal and iron ore, raw materials that are essential for the production of iron and steel.
A beech tree in the Forest of Fontainebleau rears back as if to begin a bow to the photographer who would so majestically immortalize it. Of the many studies Gustave Le Gray made in Fontainebleau, a popular destination for artists and vacationing Parisians in the mid-nineteenth century, this photograph is the nearest to a portrait. With its gnarly roots exposed, the tree assumes center stage, a majestic and commanding force of nature whose trunk glows in the direct sunlight as if lit from within. Its leaves shimmer in the sun's glow, making the dense foliage appear weightless.
With aesthetic guidebooks and discreetly painted arrows and numbers on the trees and rocks to direct the visitor along its paths, the Forest of Fontainebleau attracted many artists, particularly those of theBarbizonlandscape school, as well as vacationing Parisians, in the mid-nineteenth century. Gustave Le Gray, evidently influenced by the Barbizon painters, made many studies of Fontainebleau's foliage; here he focused on a road, representing the human intrusion in the natural landscape. The road cuts a broad swath through the forest, where the lushly dense foliage was abruptly interrupted to accommodate the needs of travelers.
The contre-jour[backlighted]effect and the passing gleam of light on the water produced by a momentary opening in the clouds aroused the wonder and envy of all photographers who saw this picture at the many exhibitions in which it was subsequently shown. The  moonlight  effect...was due to the necessary exposure.So wrote a reviewer after the photograph was first exhibited in 1856. Though no seam can be found between sea and sky, viewers speculated that this image, like other seascapes by Le Gray, was acombination print. In the 1850s, it was virtually impossible to render both sea and sky in the same negative. If the photographer exposed the film so that the sea or land was fully rendered, the sky would be overexposed and appear white; if exposed for the sky, the sea or land would appear dark as a silhouette. As it happened, the luminosity of the cloud-laden sky was equal to that of the water, making it possible for Le Gray to render each area exquisitely in a single negative. Here the sun breaks through the clouds at the upper right and reflects on the sea's shimmering surface directly below. The brig appears to sail just into or out of the watery clearing.
Positioning his camera so that the Le Havre lighthouse was precisely in the middle of his field of vision, Gustave Le Grey made this dramatic photograph along France's northwest coast. This composition is far more geometric than many of Le Gray's seascapes. The lighthouse and jetty divides the picture vertically into two nearly equal halves, just as the line of the sea and sky splits it horizontally. The waves lapping onto the pebble beach and the billowing clouds, both of which advance to the right, infuse this brooding image with a dynamic sense of movement.
Active scenes in nature, such as a moving boat and waves breaking on the rocks, had never been photographed before, but Gustave Le Gray was an indomitable innovator whose technical improvements to the medium shortened his exposure times. What he could not improve upon, however, was the simultaneous exposure of sea and sky. Given photography's chemical limitations at that time, if he exposed the negative so that the sea was rendered clearly, the sky would be so overexposed as to appear empty. If he exposed for the sky, the sea and shore would appear only as silhouettes. In this composition, he opted to let the sea and land dominate. In reality, the blowing sails and choppy waters indicate a more tumultuous sky than the one seen here.Around 1855 Le Gray began to make a series of seascapes and maritime studies. This view was made at Ste, a Mediterranean port in southern France; it was taken from roughly the same position on the bank asLe Grande Vague, Ste(The Great Wave, Ste). This print's vertical format, the only one among Le Gray's many seascapes, emphasizes the boats' blowing sails.
Formed in 1855 as  an army of the Orient  for the war in the Crimea, the Imperial Guard included a regiment of black Algerian Zouave soldiers. In 1857Napoleon IIIestablished a military camp east of Paris at Chlon-sur-Marne for twenty-five thousand men of the Imperial Guard and commissioned Le Gray to document life in the camp. Le Gray's lodgings in the Imperial quarter faced the Zouave camp, where he made eight photographs of the regiment. He filled his compositions with figures as though he were attempting to register each varied aspect of dress, ethnicity, and gesture in one frame. Only two or three men appear at all aware of or interested in Le Gray's presence; they go about their daily routine without affectation or self-consciousness.
In 1857Napoleon IIIcommissioned Gustave Le Gray to  record the principal scenestaken from each of the camps of the Guard, and portraits of the officers, generals and superiors, French and foreign, who had traveled to the camp, be they commanders or guests of the emperor  at the Camp de Chlons, a military encampment east of Paris at Chlon-sur-Marne. It was established for the staff and twenty-five thousand troops of the Imperial Guard, which had been formed in 1855 as  an army of the Orient  for the war in the Crimea. The photographs were put into albums that the emperor presented to each general.The Imperial Guard's presence for six weeks was conceived of as a military showplace during which the Guard executed eleven defense maneuvers of increasing complexity. The maneuvers were highly theatrical, almost choreographed. Here troops execute a maneuver behind a field bulwark. The spare tranquility and the enveloping cloud of dust indicate a moment either just before or after  a rapid, violent, and tumultuous engagement.  Seen at a distance, the troops seem almost incidental to the wide expanses of dark ground and empty sky.
The FrenchEmperor Napoleon IIIcommissioned Gustave Le Gray to  record the principal scenestaken from each of the camps of the Guard, and portraits of the officers, generals and superiors, French and foreign, who had traveled to the camp.  The camps were established near Paris at Chlon-sur-Marne for the twenty-five thousand men of the Imperial Guard and their staff. The photographs commemorating the Guard's six-week presence at the camp were subsequently assembled into presentation albums given by the Emperor to each general.Napoleon and the Empress Eugnie stayed in a tent of plain blue and white striped ticking,  recalling nothing of the luxury that always accompanies a sovereign.  They clearly did not eschew all luxury; here Le Gray records the preparations for a banquet outside of the Imperial tent. Though the seating consists of camp stools, two soldiers have draped the tables with heavy white damask cloths and set them with crystal.
Around 1855 Gustave Le Gray began a series of seascapes and maritime studies that were unprecedented for their dynamic compositions. This is one of the first photographs giving the appearance of stopping motion. The view was made at Ste, a Mediterranean port in southern France, and was taken from roughly the same position on the bank asThe Broken Wave, Ste (La Vague Brise, Ste).Given the limitations of photographic chemistry at that time, if Le Gray made his exposure so that the sea would be clearly rendered, the sky would be so overexposed as to appear empty, but if he exposed for the sky, the sea and shore would appear as silhouettes. His solution was to make acombination print: the stormy clouds are one negative, while the sea with its crashing waves and the blackened jetty moored on the horizon are another. The seamless result is a coherent evocation of nature's dramatic activity.
Outside their striped tent, a group of Algerian soldiers in Emperor Napolon III's army listen attentively as a well-decorated member of their regiment spins a tale. Seated on one-legged stools, the outer circle of men listen with their hands on their knees while the points of their swords rest on the parched earth. Known as Zouaves, these soldiers were famous for their bravery and for their spirited theatrical antics. Gustave Le Gray photographed this group as part of a commission to document a military training camp outside Paris. Aware that the Zouaves were highly entertaining to their fellow soldiers, as well as to the Emperor, Le Gray photographed this regiment more often than any other.
Alternately titledLe Vapeur(The Steamship), this photograph of a tugboat leaving a black cloud of steam in its wake is a study in atmospheric textures. Presumably pulling the sailing ship back to port, the tugboat, which is dwarfed by the luxury boat, exerts itself fully, judging from the vaporous emission that it spouts in the effort. The activity stands in dramatic relief to the serenity of the sea that it crosses; a few other boats are barely visible dots on the horizon. Gustave Le Gray favored such fleeting moments, scenes that existed only long enough to be photographed. He positioned his camera to eliminate all reference to the shoreline, which gives the illusion that the photographer was on the water with the vessels.
Gustave Le Gray made this six-part panorama of the French army's newly founded summer training camp, located on a flat plain east of Paris, at the request of Napolon III. Standing within the elevated boundary of the Emperor's quarters, Le Gray rotated his camera on an axis to capture Napolon's striped tent on the left, the vast plain with hundreds of tiny white tents in the distance, and, on the far right, an elevated altar for mass. The concentration on the middle ground emphasizes the expanse of space, and the scale of the military enterprise. Though the character of the light changes from one part of the landscape to another, Le Gray achieved a seamless continuity between the segmented images.
Towering over the buildings around it, this Parisian landmark was recently restored and surrounded by newly planted trees just before Gustave Le Gray photographed it. The tower is all that remains of a church built in the 1500s and demolished in 1797. During the reign of Napolon III, many Paris buildings were torn down to make way for wider streets or new structures. TheGothicTour Saint-Jacques was spared this fate thanks to massive public protests.
An ornate railroad car belonging to Pope Pius IX, the head of the Roman Catholic Church from 1846 to 1887, sits on an unfinished piece of track. For the fortunate few who could afford it, such luxurious custom cars were available, though their passengers were still subject to violent jolts when the train started. But for the majority of passenger, railroad travel was incredibly uncomfortable in the 1800s. Most passenger cars had little more to offer than wooden seats or benches and a pot-bellied stove.Gustave Le Gray's interest in railroads appears to have been minimal; few prints of the subject by him exist. In 1859, the first year photographs were included at theSalon, Le Gray exhibited this image in a gallery adjoining that for the official Salon painting.
Standing opposite a newly built pavilion of the Louvre, Gustave Le Gray made this photograph when the sun's position allowed him to best capture the details of the heavily ornamented facade, from the fluted columns on the ground level to the figurative group on the nearest gable.  Paving stones lead the viewer's eye directly to the corner of the pavilion, where the sunlit facade is further highlighted beside an area blanketed in shadow.Though the extensive art collections of the Louvre had first been opened to the public in 1793, after the French Revolution, it was not until 1848 that the museum became the property of the state. Le Gray's image shows the exuberance of the architecture undertaken shortly thereafter, during the reign of Napolon III, when large sections of the building housed government offices.
Gustave Le Gray documented the architectural ruins of two periods and cultures in this photograph taken in Baalbek, Lebanon: the slender columns from a second century Roman temple of Bacchus, and the heavy stonework from an Arab fortification built about one thousand years later. Centuries of decay are evident in the pile of crumbled building material in the foreground.Le Gray arrived in Lebanon shortly after his temperamental friend, the great writer Alexandre Dumas, on whose luxury yacht he had been traveling, abandoned him on the island of Malta. Le Gray then traveled to Beirut, where he made photographs for a French newspaper interested in the effects of civic unrest there.
Giuseppe Garibaldi stared into Gustave Le Gray's lens with the kind of piercing look that called men to arms-a fitting gaze for a revolutionary commander who demanded that the Italian people  Give me the ready hand rather than the ready tongue.  A master of guerilla warfare, Garibaldi was a champion of the rights of labor and of women's emancipation. He believed in racial equality and the abolition of capital punishment, and led numerous revolutionary campaigns against the repressive French monarchy in the kingdom that included Naples and Sicily. This portrait was made in the midst of his 1860 conquest of Sicily, a decisive event that furthered Garibaldi's efforts to unify Italy under the leadership of King Victor Emmanuel.An engraving made after Le Gray's contemplative portrait helped publicize Garibaldi's efforts.
Gustave Le Gray was not the first photographer to make images of Egypt's Hypostyle Hall in Karnak--his former student John Beasly Greene was there over a decade before him--but his images are by far the most dramatic. When arranging this photograph, Le Gray waited until a diagonal pattern of light and shadow cut across the center of thecomposition, receding to the fallen column at the rear. The clarity with which he recorded the hieroglyphics on the temple's forty-five-foot tall columns is a testament to his technical expertise.
Travelers to the Far East and the New World brought back three new hot drinks to Europe during the 1600s: tea, coffee, and chocolate. By the middle of the 1700s, these drinks had become part of the daily life of the aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie, requiring new serving vessels from which to pour them. Chocolate was considered a breakfast drink, tea was drunk in the afternoon, and coffee was taken after dinner.Porcelain was the favorite material for tea, coffee, and chocolate services, as it did not crack with heat and remained fairly cool to the touch, unlike silver vessels. This tea service, consisting of two cups and saucers, a covered sugar bowl, teapot, and tray, displaysRococoshapes and Neoclassical-style painted decoration. The pierced and lobed tray, with ribbons entwined around the handles and latticework panels, is typically Rococo; in contrast, the use of neat, symmetrical arrangements of floral garlands and arabesques is aNeoclassicaltrait.
Such an elaborately ornamented cup and saucer was intended for display rather than use. Its heavily decorated surface combined various complicated techniques: jeweling, painted cameos, and painted scenes. The expensive technique known asjeweling,using stamped gold foils set with colored enamels to imitate pearls and precious jewels in red, yellow, orange, and green, was used at the Svres Porcelain Manufactory for only five years, between 1780 and 1785.On the sides of the cup and saucer, slightly domed oval plaques of porcelain have been attached, imitating stone cameos with profiles of classical busts. The painted reserves show scenes from the sacrifice of Cupid. All these decorative elements are set in a deep brown ground color--a novelty at Svres at this date--evocatively namedmerde d'oie,literally  goose droppings. These objects were gilded by tienne-Henri Le Guay and jeweled by Philippe Parpette.
Leaning back, Venus, goddess of love and beauty, gently twists her head to look at the small wreath she holds aloft in her left hand. Nude, her drapery falling down upon her legs, she rests on a rock amidst seashells. According to myth, Venus was born from the foam of the sea, an aspect of her legend suggested by the sculpture's title, Venus Marina. Although cupid or a dolphin usually accompanies Venus Marina, neither are present here.This tabletop bronze was made after a model attributed to the French sculptor Robert Le Lorrain. As was characteristic of the Rococo period, the sculpture is a subtle work with no large movements or heroic story. A restrained sensuality of delicate curves and flowing drapery dominates as the sculptor focused on small variations of texture and line. He contrasted, for example, the complex shape and rough texture of the striated rock with Venus's smooth skin and simple open forms. Other similar Venus figures attest to the popularity of this genre of sculpture in France in the early 1700s.
When Franois Le Moyne produced this pastel drawing of him, the French KingLouis XVwas only nineteen years old. Viewed from below, Louis poses informally without a wig, his hair left long and unpowdered. He gazes off into the distance, wearing a calm yet regal expression.Using fine strokes of black chalk, Le Moyne created the young king's gently curling hair. Delicate lines of pastel give softhighlightsto his hair, eyes, nose, and slightly pursed lips. Darker shadows around the jaw line form Louis's round and fleshy chin.Le Moyne made this drawing as apreparatory studyfor the head of the king in anallegoricalportrait,Louis XV Bestows Peace upon Europe.The work was commissioned in 1729 when the king was trying to build a central role for France as a peacemaker. The painting, which originally hung at the entrance to the Hall of Mirrors atVersailles, was as much a tool for propaganda as it was a portrait of the young ruler.
This piece of mid-eighteenth-century furniture was meant to be used like a modern filing cabinet: papers were placed in leather-fronted cardboard boxes (now missing) that were fitted into the open shelves. A large table decorated in the same manner would have been placed in front for working with those papers. Access to thecartonnier's lower half can only be gained by the doors at the sides, because the table would have blocked the front.The painted black-and-gold decoration is commonly known asvernis Martin,named after the Martin brothers, Parisians who excelled at the craft of imitating Japaneselacquer. Their workshop probably also supplied the bronze Chinese figures flanking and surmounting above the clock.
In a rural setting, a peasant family sits admiring a baby in a cradle suspended from the branches of a tree. Thecompositiontakes its name from the distinctive hanging cradle made of boughs lashed together. Surrounded by goats and sheep, an old woman in a red dress and decorative headscarf holds a distaff and points towards the infant as if telling its fortune. The blue sky with pink-tinged clouds recalls the influence of Franois Boucher, Jean-Baptiste Le Prince's former teacher.Jean-Baptiste Le Prince served in Saint Petersburg at the court of Catherine the Great between 1760 and 1762. Upon his return to Paris in 1765, he made this painting and thirteen others that he exhibited in theSalon. To an eighteenth-century French audience, this improbable scene would have seemed exotic and picturesque. In reality, Russian peasants were still serfs tied to the land and its owner; it is unlikely that they would have enjoyed the leisure time depicted here.Based on drawings and recollections from the artist's extensive travels throughout Russia,The Russian Cradleproved immensely popular and was replicated in drawings, prints, and even as decoration on Svresporcelain.
An eighteenth-century clock such as this one was a collaborative effort of numerous craftsmen. The clockmaker, in this case the king's own clockmaker Julien Le Roy, produced only the movement. Le Roy would have commissioned a sculptor to design the elaborate model, a bronze caster to produce the bronze case, and a gilder to chase and gild it. The enamel clock dial was then painted and fired separately by a specialized enameler, Antoine-Nicolas Martinire.
At least three specialized craftsmen collaborated to produce this elaborate gilt bronze wall clock. The clockmaker Julien Le Roy, who signed the clock face and the movement, made the interior movement mechanisms. The bronze caster Jacques Caffieri cast and gilded the ornate case, which would have been the most costly part to produce. In this rare example, he engraved his signature on a cartouche below the dial. Antoine-Nicolas Martinire, the enameler, painted the numbers on the clock face and fired the whole dial. He inscribed the back of it with his name and the date1747.A detailed inventory of Jacques Caffieri's workshop made in 1747 describes a clock similar to this one, decorated with the figures of Minerva andCupidholding a scythe. Minerva, thepatronof learning and the arts, wears a helmet and armor and perches on a cloud on the top of the dial. The winged figure of Cupid, probably once holding a scythe in his hand, symbolizes Love conquering Time.
To the left sits a female figure with a celestial globe represents Astronomy, while on the right, Geography holds a loosely rolled map. Both figures are well modeled and must have been made by an accomplished sculptor. As is often the case with objects made entirely of bronze, the clock is not signed. A drawing of this work still survives, signed by the bronze caster tienne Martincourt. At the time of theFrench Revolution, this clock stood on the mantel ofLouis XVI'sSalonde Conseil(Council Room) at the Tuileries Palace.Charles Le Roy, whose name appears on the dial and the movement of the clock, died in 1771. As two springs are dated 1772, however, the clock was obviously completed after his death. The movement must have been finished by Le Roy's son tienne-Augustin, who signed his father's name, following the accepted practice of the time.
Henri Le Secq's close-up view turns this church tower into a work of elaborate sculpture rather than architecture. Commissioned by the French government as part of the 1851Mission Hliographique(Heliographic Mission), Le Secq photographed the Tower of Kings, the south tower of Notre-DameCathedralat Rheims, northeast of Paris, from high up in another tower. Details that would ordinarily be missed from the ground are here revealed with breathtaking clarity.From 1845 to 1864, the architect Eugne Viollet-le-Duc worked on the restoration of the Cathedral. Construction scaffolding, which almost disappears in the elaborate decoration of the exterior, is visible encasing the tower at left.
Classically proportioned sea gods and goddesses partially clad in intensely colored drapery form a dramatic procession against a light blue sky. This painting illustrates an episode in Francesco Colonna'sHypnerotomachia Poliphili(Strife of Love in a Dream of Polyphilus), an extravagantRenaissancetale of a dream-journey throughantiquity. To the left, the lovers Polyphilus and Polia are ferried to Cythera, the island of love. The sea goddessAmphitrite, reclining in a shell at the lower right, andNeptune, seated high on a shell and holding histriton, watch the boat depart from amidst a crowd of figures.Although first published in 1499, Colonna's book enjoyed immense popularity in seventeenth-century France.Marine Gods Paying Homage to Loveis one of Eustache Le Sueur's eight canvases illustrating theHypnerotomachia Poliphili;it was painted as a model for a Gobelins tapestry that was never executed.
From this low point of view, the massive figure of the Roman general Astasius appears large and strong. During his occupation of Milan, Astasius ordered his soldiers to arrest any Christians they could find. His soldiers dragged two brothers, Gervais and Protase, before the general, who ordered them to be killed when they refused to make sacrifices to the godJupiter.Eustache Le Sueur captured Astasius at the moment when he turns to watch the presentation of Gervais and Protase. Le Sueur drew this monumental figure with a combination of vigorous sketching and precise definition. While the chalk lines on the left side of the figure are free and loose, on the right, the artist painstakingly depicted the drapery folds, using hatching and smudging to create the dark creases.In March 1652 the churchwardens of the church of Saints Gervais and Protase in Paris commissioned six tapestries from Le Sueur about the lives of the saints. This drawing was one of several studies made for an enormous multi-figured tapestrycartoon. The artist delivered the final design to the tapestry manufactory in May 1653.
As the last of his twelve labors, the Greek heroHerakleshad to capture Kerberos, the monstrous three-headed dog ofHades. On thisblack-figureneck-amphora, Herakles holds his club and strides forward, driving the beast before him. With him are two divine helpers,AthenaandHermes. Athena, the goddess of war and patron of heroes, raises her arm in a gesture of greeting, while Hermes aids the hero in his role as guide to the Underworld. In some versions of the myth, Hermes distracted Kerberos with food while Herakles put him on a leash. Perhaps that critical role of Hermes is implied on this vase, because the two visible heads of Kerberos look intently at him.On the back of the vase,Dionysos, the god of wine, and his wifeAriadnestand flanked bysatyrs, half-human companions of the god. Dionysos holds his usual attributes of a drinking horn and an ivy branch. Dionysiac scenes were popular and fitting decoration for vases like thisamphorathat were used in a symposion or drinking party.
Scenes from the mythologicalTrojan Wardecorate this Athenianblack-figureneck-amphora. On the front, Achilles and Ajax, two great heroes of the Greeks, sit playing a board game. The goddess Athena stands in front of the board and gestures. The warriors have their armor and weapons ready, as if just pausing during a break in the conflict. This scene of Ajax and Achilles gaming was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Many scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase. These hoplites may be Greeks on the march to counter a Trojan attack, while Ajax and Achilles are notified by Athena. Such an interpretation would explainAthena'sunusually prominent position on this rendition of the scene.
For the Greeks, the mythicalTrojan Warwas the central event in their early history. Episodes from that conflict fill Greek art and literature. A scene from the culmination of that war, the sack of Troy, decorates the front of this Athenianblack-figureneck-amphora. The Trojan hero Aeneas has lifted his aged father Anchises onto his back and carries him to safety, escaping the fallen city. They are preceded byAeneas'syoung son. Behind them, the goddessAphrodite, who had once been Anchises' lover and is Aeneas's mother, gestures in grief and sympathy. The painter of the Leagros group who decorated this vase labeled Aphrodite, Aeneas, and Anchises, adding a popular formulaic comment on their beauty, but he also added a variety of nonsense inscriptions--just meaningless combinations of letters--to the vase. The back of the vase depictsDionysos, the god of wine, frolicking withsatyrs, his partially human companions. Dionysos, who carries akantharosor drinking cup, and one of the satyrs appear to be dancing to the music played by the satyr with the aulos or double pipes.
Scenes from the world of myth and the world of humans decorate the neck of this Athenianblack-figurevolute-krater. The upper zone on one side depicts the battle of the gods and the Giants. In Greek mythology, the giants, the children of Ge (Earth) and Uranus (Sky), tried to overthrow theOlympian godsin a mighty battle. Only three gods are clearly identifiable here:Herakleswith his lion skin,Athenawith her snake-edged aegis, andHermeswith his special staff and winged boots. The lowerfriezeon this side shows various athletic contests: two runners in armor, a naked runner, a discus thrower, a javelin thrower, wrestlers, and trainers. The scene at the right shows a particularly bloody version of the pankration, a combination of wrestling and boxing in which anything was fair except biting an opponent or gouging his eyes out.On the other side of the vase, the lower zone on the neck shows a group of warriors departing in their chariots. Departure scenes were popular inArchaicart, but this scene is more elaborate than usual.The handles of this krater, a vessel used for mixing wine and water, are in the form of large curls or volutes, hence the name of this shape, a volute-krater.
With his piercing gaze and fashionable attire, this unidentified gentleman must have been among the most dashing members of the French court. The artist meticulously recorded his ruffed collar, elaborately tied doublet, and handsome mustache with strokes of red and black chalk, blending the two colors to achieve brown tones and create an astonishingly lifelike presence. Artists began making bust length portraits like this at the French court in the late 1500s. Such drawings, made as independent works of art, were particularly prized among the nobility, who appreciated their exquisite execution and the accuracy with which they presented a sitter's likeness.
The painted doors and panels and thegiltplasterreliefsculptures in the overdoors in this room come from the main reception room of a house built for Jean-Baptiste Hosten. Hosten, a wealthy planter from Santo Domingo, commissioned the celebrated architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux to build his Paris residence, the Maison Hosten, starting around 1790. This building was the focus of a larger housing scheme and was to be surrounded by fifteen other townhouses built on speculation. When theFrench Revolutionforced Hosten to flee France in 1795, only six of the townhouses along with this one had been completed. The paneling in this room was removed at the end of the 1800s when the entire house was demolished.In this project, one of Ledoux's last, the architect called on some of the most celebrated painters and sculptors of his era to implement his decorative scheme. Thegrotesquedecoration, which combines graceful arabesques and wingedcentaurswithpalmettesandsphinxes, shows some of the finest decorative work of the late 1700s.
In this stark, poignant drawing, Henri Lehmann concentrated on capturing the dramatic emotions of the mourners grieving over Christ's death. The immediate focus of attention, theVirgin Maryswoons in a faint at the foot of the cross, surrounded byJoseph of Arimathea, Mary Magdalene, and several other women. The drapery swirling around the cross and the various gestures and expressions of grief emphasize the scene's pathos. The tip of a spear, the crown of thorns, and four nails on the ground beneath the Virgin's hands signify the implements of Christ's suffering.Lehmann's strong verticalcomposition, with figures wrapped around the foot of the central cross, anchors the scene. In sharp contrast to the dark graywashon the other figures, he used large amounts of white chalk highlighting on and around the Virgin's face. He made this study as one of the last stages in his preparation for a painting in a Paris chapel.
Although it looks like a completely closed form, this secrtaire opens out for use, probably in a library. After inserting and winding a lever, the center of the front rises from vertical to horizontal and unfolds to form a wide, deep surface large enough to hold an openfoliovolume. In addition to this unusual feature, this object has a lower and shallower form than other secrtaires, indicating that it may have been made for a specific location.The secrtaire's drawers are also equipped with clever locking mechanisms. The eight drawers above the rising front--two in thefriezeand six small drawers below--all lock with only two keys. Interior bolts fasten the four drawers at each side of the secrtaire and are released when the uppermost drawer is unlocked and opened.ThebnisteJean-Franois Leleu, who built this secrtaire, was known for his mechanical systems, following in the footsteps of his master Jean-Franois Oeben. Both master and student used ingenious but simple mechanisms, with few moving parts to malfunction.
Louise de Keroualle, the duchess of Portsmouth, sits in front of a window open to a lush landscape. Her loosely draped blue silk dress reveals the creamy skin of her chest and neck. In a pose both sensual and elegant, with her head slightly turned, Louise de Keroualle looks down at the viewer as she plays with a thick, lush strand of her abundant hair. Her features--almond-shaped eyes, gently arched eyebrows, a straight nose, and full red lips--epitomized ideal beauty of the late 1600s.Louise de Keroualle, who worked as a spy forLouis XIV, came to England from France as a Maid of Honour to the sister of King Charles II in 1670. Soon afterward, she became Charles's favorite mistress, and in 1673 he created for her the position of Duchess of Portsmouth. She used her influence to strengthen the friendship between Charles II and Louis XIV.
Erna Lendvai-Dircksen photographed this woman farmer in a close-up profile, emphasizing her subject as a monumental, idealized type. Borrowing her models fromgenrepainting of the 1800s, Lendvai-Dircksen followed the Nazi model of authentic Aryan art that celebrated their view of a physical ideal. She frequently chose to use her considerable talent and energy for the glory of the German race rather than attempting a more balanced study of human types.
According to artist and biographer Giorgio Vasari, Leonardo da Vinci was  so delighted when he saw curious heads, whether bearded or hairy, that he would follow anyone who had thus attracted his attention for a whole day, acquiring such a clear idea of him that when he went home he would draw the head as well as if the man had been present. Leonardo depicted the man's hair with his characteristicsfumato. The hatching lines slant downward from left to right, running in the natural direction for the left-handed artist. He made this caricature as one of a large series of head studies created in pairs. Years after the artist's death, collectors cut the pairs into individual drawings. Many later artists admired and copied Leonardo's caricatures, both in drawings and prints.
Using pen and ink and chalk, Leonardo da Vinci drew a child and a lamb several times, trying out different poses for the figures. He may have begun with the smaller and more freely sketched study in the upper right. He then drew the figures again below, changing the angle of the child and the sheep's face. Lastly, he drew the more elaborate study at the bottom left, in which the legs are posed with greater complexity and the child leans back on the lamb.Leonardo probably made the drawing in preparation for a painting of the Virgin and Child with Saint John, now lost but known through copies. He inscribed some notes unrelated to the drawing at the top of the sheet in his characteristic backwards writing, legible only with the help of a mirror.
These magnificent relief-molded tiles once formed part of the wall of a stove. From the 1300s onward, brick or glazed tile stoves heated the main rooms of homes by radiating warmth through their exteriors from a series of pipes. Because they could both withstand and evenly transmit heat, ceramic tiles were well suited to this function.Two heroic leaders,Alexander the Greatand Nimrod, decorate the tiles, which once formed part of a larger group probably decorated with similarly powerful men. The unknown distinguishedpatronwho commissioned them might have wished to associate himself with the figures' powerful qualities. On one tile, Alexander wears fantasticclassicalarmor and a feathered headdress and holds a staff and banner. At his feet crouches Cerberus, the monstrous three-headed dog and gatekeeper of the Underworld. The other tile shows Nimrod, a legendary Assyrian whom theBibledescribed as  the first on earth to be a mighty man . . . . a mighty hunter before the Lord.  He also wears fantastic garb, combining classical armor with an eastern type of flowing breeches. Like Alexander, he holds a banner and a small staff, while a winged lion crouches at his feet.
In the time that it took the photographer to make this image, the soft yellow light of mid-day had shifted (on the left) to the golden hues of late afternoon, (on the right).This is one of forty-seven images that make up the series Habitat 7. Using an 8 x 10-inch camera mounted on a tripod, Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao made numerous exposures over the course of several hours, adjusting it to expand his angle of vision or capture the changing light. After scanning his color negatives, Liao used digital editing software to stitch together a large-scale image that presents broad sweeps of information in minute detail. The resulting inkjet print is a complex, composite image that encapsulates the elements of time and movement.Since moving to New York in 1999, Liao has lived along the number 7 subway line, which connects Main Street in Flushing, Queens, to Times Square in Manhattan. Likening the train's path to the rivers around which ancient civilizations developed and flourished, Liao selected specific locations as both the subject and vantage point for his Habitat 7 series. The series  transports  viewers from Flushing to the east and moving westward through the neighborhoods of Corona Park, Jackson Heights, Woodside, and Sunnyside before arriving in Manhattan. Each image creates a seamless whole, as does Liao's portrayal of the culturally and economically diverse communities that coexist harmoniously along the eight and a half miles of the train, sometimes referred to as the  International Express.

In this sculpture, painting's basic building block, the brushstroke, has been playfully transformed into an oversized, three-dimensional form. Made from aluminum, three vertical  strokes  of pure color are frozen in space and rise to a height of more than ten feet. One edge of the yellow brushstroke cuts through the dominant stroke of black and blue; the yellow also curves into a diminutive stroke of red paint.Each brushstroke is a fully realized three-dimensional form that, somewhat implausibly, allows the viewer to experience a stroke of paint from different vantage points. The sculpture humorously reminds us that paint is literally three-dimensional.Roy Lichtenstein first explored brushstrokes as a subject in a series of paintings initiated in 1965. As with many of his works, he used a comic book source--a panel of an artist at work fromStrange Suspense Stories--as the basis for his brushstrokes. The subject became one of the artist's most recognizable images and he would return regularly to the brushstrokemotiffor more than thirty years. In the early 1980s, Lichtenstein began creating sculptural brushstrokes.
An old woman sits alone with a cat in front of a rough wall. Her head bowed to the side and her large coarse hands gently embracing the cat emphasize the emotional bond between the woman and her pet. Through such gestures, Max Liebermann filled the subject with his own understated and affecting humanity. He depicted the woman in bright light and wearing a richly colored skirt, thus omitting obvious signs of poverty and avoiding an unnecessary display of sentimentality.Influenced by the Dutch Masters of the 1600s, Liebermann became fascinated with themes that concerned contemplative states. He also absorbed the lessons of French painters; his richly worked execution of this painting reflects thepainterlystyle he learned in Paris in the 1870s.The Old Woman with Catwas painted in 1878 in Venice, where Liebermann went to recuperate after breaking his leg. He captured that city's famous golden light to harmonize the rich and disparate colors and textures of the woman and the setting.
Over a period of three years, court scribe David Aubert wrote a four-volume work in French titledHistoire de Charles Martel.It totals four thousand pages and tells the story of Charles Martel (r. 719 to 741),Charlemagne'sgrandfather. Late medieval knights undoubtedly enjoyed reading the adventures of such earlier heroes, and they would have drawn inspiration from Charles's exploits.Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, commissioned this enormousmanuscriptfor his already sumptuously endowed library of more than seven hundred volumes, one of the great libraries of the 1400s.Several years after Philip's death, theilluminationof this extravagant undertaking had barely begun. In 1468 ducal accounts show payments to Pol Fruit of Bruges for painting the initials in the third volume. A year or so later, Philip's son and heir DukeCharles the Boldhired Loyset Lidet to paint the book's 123miniatures. Court accounts record that Lidet received his final payment in 1472, showing that the entire manuscript took almost a decade to complete.The four volumes of the book, with 101 of the original miniatures, belong to the Royal Library in Brussels, which acquired the core of Philip the Good's library. Fifteen leaves with half-page miniatures, removed in the 1700s, are part of the Getty Museum's collection.
Richly dressed in an ermine-collared cloak and magnificent crown, theByzantineemperor emerges from the city of Constantinople on a white horse, surrounded by members of his court. A religious procession, including a group of clerics singing from open books, precedes him. The emperor appears again in thebackgroundat the right, this time greeting the Europeans who disembark from their boat after their long journey. As therubricjust below theminiatureexplains, in the 800s Girart de Roussillon and Charles Martel went to assist the Emperor of Constantinople in his battles with the Saracens. When Loyset Lidet painted this miniature in the 1400s, the subject had a special resonance: the recent Turkish capture of Constantinople in 1453 recalled theSaracenincursions and prompted calls for Europeancrusadersto rescue the city.
The political conflicts of Duke Philip of Burgundy, who commissioned thismanuscript, withKing Charles VIIof France, paralleled the manuscript's account of earlier French struggles. In this image, the armies of the Frankish ruler Charles Martel and his rebellious Burgundian vassal Girart de Roussillon wait with tense expectancy for a new battle to begin. The two armies face each other, their strength indicated by the sea of helmets that extends into the distance on either side. Charles kneels in prayer before his army, displaying the French fleur-de-lis on his clothing, on his horse's trappings, and on the banner behind him.
Thisminiaturefrom theHistory of Charles Martelillustrates events in the story of Charles's rivalry with the powerful Burgundian duke, Gerard de Roussillon. As Gerard and his wife Bertha journey to Hungary, bandits steal everything, even their horses, and leave the couple desperate. On the left, a hermit stands before his simple retreat and offers them food and lodging. On the right, the duke and his wife find a spring from which to drink. Loyset Lidet  used apaletteof bright colors to tell the story in his illustrations, evoking the splendor of contemporary Burgundian court dress.
Charles Martel was an early ruler of France, and Duke Gerard de Roussillon was his Burgundian vassal. In the 700s, the duke came to Martel's aid, saving him from death in a battle against the Saracens. When this book was made in the 1400s, such a battle between East and West had great relevance: theOttomanTurks, heirs to the Muslim Saracens, had just conquered Constantinople, putting an end to theByzantineEmpire and Christian rule in the east. The scene of the earlier battle would have reminded European viewers of this recent conquest and their long-time enemies, the Turks.
In thisminiaturefrom theHistory of Charles Martel,the army of Lorraine, led by Count Arnault, and the forces of Burgundy, led by his wife Lydia and her two sons, are about to begin a battle. The Burgundians stand in thebackgroundat the left, under the banner of the double eagle andBORDEAUS,while the forces of Lorraine mass at the right. In theforeground, the leaders of the opposing forces meet on horseback in advance of the fighting.Loyset Lidet and Pol Fruit depicted this scene not as an event from the past but in terms of the pageantry and splendor of late medieval court life. Lydia sits sidesaddle upon her horse, fashionably dressed in the elegant style of the Burgundian court of the later 1400s.
Sitting on an elaborately upholstered throne covered with fleurs-de-lis, Charles Martel's son Pepin the Short receives his crown as king of the Franks in 751. The papal legate Boniface, in red at the left, and a pair of Frankish bishops at either side of Pepin performed the ceremony at Soissons. Among the splendidly attired nobles in attendance was  the powerful duke Henry of Metz  mentioned in the text below, probably the figure in the ermine-trimmed cape at the far right.Theilluminator, Loyset Lidet, gave the scene the look of a coronation of his own time rather than of seven hundred years earlier. The pageantry would have held a special appeal for an aristocratic, late medieval viewer.
Wearing a gold medallion around his neck, an elderly man leans forward and extends a hand towards a youth who sits in front of a book. The man looks neither at the boy nor at the large open volume but instead gazes sympathetically at the viewer. Wearing a laurel wreath upon his head and dressed in a golden yellow robe with a richly embroidered cape, the daydreaming boy stares off into the distance.Jan Lievens, who shared Rembrandt's interest in historical portraits featuring characters in fanciful costumes, here depicted Prince Charles Louis of the Palatinate being taught by his tutor Wolrad von Plessen. Previously thought to be a biblical depiction of Eli instructing Samuel, current research reveals that these figures were meant to allude to the classical figures of Aristotle instructing the young Alexander. Both Prince Charles Louis and Alexander the Great were about fourteen years old when they received instruction from their respective mentors.
A narrow road dappled with sunlight winds through a forest, past a cottage where a family is begging for money at the gate. A traveler with a backpack and stick rests in the shade at the path's edge, while in the distance a woman wearing a broad hat carries two buckets on a yoke. The traditional title of the drawing refers to a path in the Haagse Bos, a large forest around The Hague in the Netherlands.Although Jan Lievens produced this and most of his landscape drawings in the studio, he still managed to capture many minute details: the varied textures of leaves in sunlight, trees with delicate hatching on their trunks, and careful shading on the path to show the sunlight and shadows. Lievens used a rare and costly sheet of Japanese paper for this drawing. The slightly iridescent surface of the paper gives the composition an added warmth and rich sheen. Japanese paper was quite hard to find in the Netherlands during the 1600s, and the only other artist who used it often was Rembrandt, a friend and former colleague of Lievens.
Jacopo Ligozzi's vivid colors and gold paint underscore the splendid, exotic character of his subject, anazappo,a seafaring Turkish archer, and a cheetah. Ligozzi probably painted this sheet as part of a book devoted to figures in Turkish costume, many of whom are accompanied by animals. Rather than drawing from life, he used a variety of costume engravings.Ligozzi seems to have invented the idea of showing animals alongside the costumed figures. Throughout his book, the animals often act as commentaries on the figures or reflect physiognomic similarities; here, heads turned to the right and the finely drawn human and feline whiskers link the azappo and the cheetah.Ligozzi's patron, Francesco I de'Medici, probably commissioned the series. During the late 1500s, wealthypatronsinterested in science and exploration often hired artists to paint elaborate, colored illustrations offlora, fauna, and the peoples of foreign lands.
Commessocan best preserveantiquityand memory...and can resist all the battles of water and wind and other mishaps of fortune and of time.Thus Giorgio Vasari wrote ofcommesso,a newly revived antique technique for making pictures with cut stone.His comments suggest thatFerdinando I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, commissioned this portrait ofPope Clement VIIIin 1601 to preserve the pope's memory, since he honored antique culture and learning. The rigidity of themosaicmedium and the luminescence of the stones, which were thought to carry intrinsic symbolic values, give the image an austere power.Pictorial representations in stone mosaic had been popular in ancient Greece and Rome and recently revived inRenaissanceItaly. Images made of hard- and softstonecommessiwere much admired in theMedici court, particularly by Ferdinando, who founded a court workshop in which local craftsmen could be trained in the technique. Portraits in this medium, however, are exceedingly rare; this is one of only two surviving works from a group of four.
Using expressive brownwashpunctuated by the bare paper's brilliant whitehighlights, Jacopo Ligozzi captured one of Catholicism's holy miracles in this characteristically highly finished drawing. Here,Christappears to Giovanni della Verna under an enormous beech tree at La Verna in the Apennine Mountains. In addition to portraying the tree and foliage in elaborate detail, Ligozzi included in thebackgroundthe commemorative chapel built where the miracle occurred.During the 1500s and 1600s, interest in travel and tourism burgeoned. Ligozzi traveled to the remote sanctuary of La Verna in 1607 to make preparatory drawings for twenty-five etched and engraved illustrations. These were published in Fra Lino's lavish guidebook on the region,Descrizione del Sacro Monte della Vernia,in 1612. Because La Verna was also whereSaint Francishad received thestigmatain 1224, Ligozzi depicted numerous scenes of Saint Francis's life, along with the later miracles. His series included the site's rugged topography and the church, chapels, andmonasticbuildings erected there from the 1200s to the 1500s.
Made in a mold, this vase in the form of a human head depictsDionysos, the Greek god of wine. The head of a goat, an animal frequently associated with Dionysos, forms the handle of the vase. A lead glaze that ranges in color from golden yellow for the god's skin, to reddish brown for his eyes and lips, to green for the wreath in his hair, covers the vase. A stamp on the underside of this vase gives the name of its maker, Likinnios.A revival or rediscovery of an ancientNear Easternpottery technique that had been out of use for centuries, lead-glazed pottery began to be produced on the coast of modern Turkey in the first century B.C. From there, production spread to other areas and continued for several centuries, but lead-glazed pottery was never common in Roman art. Lead-based glazes achieved bright, glossy colors that were meant to imitate the appearance of precious metals.
Irene, a widow from Rome, tends to the wounds of Saint Sebastian, who miraculously survived an attack by Roman archers. On learning that Sebastian, a Roman army officer, had secretly adopted Christianity, his fellow soldiers shot him full of arrows and mistakenly left him for dead. After Irene nursed him back to health, this early martyr confronted the emperor with a renewed avowal of his faith.Andrea Lilio almost certainly executed this drawing as a study for an altarpiece. In contrast to other images of Sebastian, which usually show the saint bound to a tree or pillar and surrounded by archers, this intimate depiction focuses on the saint's spiritual exaltation.
The son of God is represented seated on heaven's throne, with his right hand raised, palm faced outward with three fingers extended. This gesture communicated a particular message to medieval Catholics in Western Europe. It is part of an iconographic pose called in Latin the  Maiestas Domini,  or  Christ in Majesty,  to symbolize his role in presiding over the human souls of all time. Images like this decorated altar frontals in Romanesque churches as a somber reminder of the coming Day of Judgment.In this gilded copper representation, Christ holds a jeweled Bible and his feet rest on an ornate enamel plaque. This Christ in Majesty served as the centerpiece of an ensemble of 52 saint and apostle figures. Together they were commissioned for the high altar of a cathedral in Orense, Spain, a stop along a famous pilgrimage route. Artisans in Limoges, France, a renowned center for the production of enamel, created this plaque and its ensemble. Most of the surviving figures lack inset pieces of glass that decorate Christ's tunic, but have similar, bead-like eyes. Visually they all relate to one another, with highly ornamental enameled backgrounds, similar to the plaque at Christ's feet. Their patterns are also dark and light blue, with white, gold, green, and red-brown accents.This figure was formed from a single sheet of copper hammered on the reverse side to  create the raised design in front. Features such as the beard, mustache, and folds of the tunic are etched into its surface. Large areas of gilding have worn away, primarily on the raised surfaces, suggesting that this object was touched over many centuries by the faithful who prayed before it.
These small enamel plaques presentallegoricalportraits of Charles IX and his mother, Queen Catherine de'Medici. On one plaque, Charles appears in the guise ofMars, wielding a shield and sword and drawn in a chariot by wolves, animals sacred to the god of war. Behind him, a war-ravaged land unfolds. In otherwordlypastelcolors, tiny figures depict the effects of war on the bottom right. On thependantplaque, Catherine appears asJuno, wife ofJupiterand mother of Mars. She wears a veil and carries a scepter, referring to Juno's roles as goddess of marriage and queen of the gods. Behind her chariot pulled by peacocks, a glorious rainbow arches above a peaceful pastoral landscape.Theiconography, which may have been dictated by Catherine, probably celebrates her role in promoting the Peace of Saint Germain, which temporarily ended the Religious Wars in France. Her representation as Juno also refers to her success in arranging marriages between her children and foreign heads of states: she recently had negotiated Charles's marriage toMargaret of Austria, a political rival. Small-scale versions of oil paintings, these plaques were designed to be hung with other enamels in an intimate room.
His body covered with sores, theOld TestamentheroJobsits on a heap of dung wearing only a loincloth. To the left stand his wife, hands impatiently on her hips, and his mocking friends. With long horns and a forked tongue, Satan claws at Job from behind. Armed figures steal Job's cattle in thebackground, while his children flee a burning house. God allowed Satan to devise this series of afflictions and humiliations to torment Job and test his faith.Daniel Lindtmayer made this study for a stained-glass window, filling not only the circular central scene but also the surrounding frame with moralizing details. The figures of Patience, with a lamb, and Hope, with an anchor, perch on either side, references to the noble qualities that Job possessed. Lush bunches of fruit and vegetables ornament the design.
To commemorate their marriage, wealthypatronsoften commissioned designs for stained-glass windows to decorate their local church. The frame of this window containspersonificationsof Spring on the left, holding a basket of flowers, and Summer on the right, holding a bundle of wheat. In the corners below, aputtoholding an anchor represents Hope, and one carrying a broken column represents Fortitude.Daniel Lindtmayer used black ink lines to outline the forms with care and precision and then added gray wash to model them and create volume. He later sketched in the husband and wife'scoats of armsand an inscription at the base that gives their names, although it is difficult to read: Hans Conradt von Pforburg and Anna von Pforburg.Lindtmayer probably produced this design as acartoonfor a glass painter to copy; it was never intended for the patrons to see. He left empty spaces for the coats of arms and only lightly sketched them in later in brown ink. He also left various areas incomplete on the right side when they mirrored the symmetrical elements on the left. Notations in black chalk throughout the design give color instructions.
Johannes Lingelbach is only known to have painted three land battle scenes. For this painting, he probably closely studied the battle pictures of Pieter van Laer, a Dutch artist whose picturesquegenrepaintings of Italian street life and peasants also inspired Lingelbach. The pose of the soldier on a white steed at the right and his costume of a feathered hat, boots, and cuirass relate to Van Laer's works.The coloring, especially the light ochre and the bright white of the horses, is characteristic of Lingelbach's work of the early 1650s. The horses' lively contours and the modeling of such details as the hat on the ground reflect his drafting abilities.
Changing attitudes towards children and the emergence of a large middle class in eighteenth-century Europe increased the demand for portraits of children such as this one. Maria Frederike, the seven-year-old daughter of an aristocratic Dutch family, looks off to the side in a three-quarter view. Lost in thought, she is composed yet somewhat shy in comparison to her dog, who stares out with unabashed curiosity. With startlingnaturalism, Jean-tienne Liotard captured her youth and beauty, setting off her eyebrows, lashes, and lustrous hair against her soft, fresh complexion.Liotard developed remarkable technical skills in the difficult medium of pastels. Brilliantly describing surfaces and defining volume through subtle gradations of color, he depicted forms, textures, and the play of light with great immediacy. He favored using pastels, especially for portraits of children, because they could be manipulated with greater speed and ease, had no odor, and allowed for frequent interruptions.
I claim myself to be one of the painters who succeeds well in producing extremely close resemblance in portraits. I owe this accomplishment . . . to the fact that I always try to give a maximum of fullness and relief in my pictures.A master at capturing sitters in fleeting moments of informality, Jean-tienne Liotard depicted this unknown sitter possessed with a remarkable degree of warmth and depth. She leans back slightly and sits with her hands casually folded in her lap, gazing to the side. Liotard's delicate application of white chalk records the details of her flounced sleeves and ruffled collar, and beautifully highlights the subject's attractive features.Liotard likely made this drawing in preparation for a pastel; the broad application of chalk indicates that Liotard made it as a kind of rough draft. The drawing remained in the artist's studio and with his family until well into the 1900s. Most likely, Liotard kept it as a record after the finished pastel left his studio, though no other such work featuring this sitter is known.
For his portrait of Charles-Benjamin de Langes de Montmirail, the Baron de Lubires, Jean-tienne Liotard drew on both sides of a thin sheet of cream-colored paper. On the verso surface, the artist delicately applied red and black pastels to achieve richer and more subtle degrees of tone and relief on the finely detailed recto. This novel technique is found in several of Liotard's portraits of the period and derives from the tradition of toning miniatures on ivory on the verso.A wealthy and erudite amateur, the Baron de Lubires was part of the writer Voltaire's circle in Geneva and contributed several articles to Diderot'sEncyclopdie.Replete with fur muff, the fashionably attired sitter is clearly a gentleman of his time. Despite the attention to dress, Liotard depicted his sitter without adornment. The Baron de Lubires is in profile against a plain background with little depth. Nothing is allowed to overshadow the close likeness of the sitter achieved by Liotard. And it is this close likeness, above all else, that is intended to speak of the Baron de Lubires as a man of singular refinement and distinction.
Lord Bute, who commissioned this portrait as a memento of his son'sGrand Tour, was so pleased with it that he paid the artist twice the agreed-upon price. Exuding the self-possessed confidence of a young aristocrat, nineteen-year-old Lord Mountstuart leans against a mantel displaying the utmost in sumptuous French attire: a fur-lined winter suit of turquoise silk, lace collar and cuffs, white silk stockings, and diamond-buckle shoes.Jean-tienne Liotard depicted the charismatic English nobleman in an elegant setting--a recreation of asalonin Geneva appointed withRococofurnishings such asfiredogsornamented with cherubs and a Chinese folding screen used to stop cold drafts. Above the mantel, Liotard depicted Mountstuart's handsome profile and dignified posture in agildedmirror.Lord Mountstuart, and to a lesser extent his reflection, are sharply depicted and project forward from the surrounding objects, which are blurred to create this optical illusion. This portrait is one of the largest pastels Liotard ever painted and the only one to show a full-length subject in a meticulously described interior. His skillful effects of scale, format, and illusion challenged the conventional medium of oil painting, and Liotard himself considered the work a masterpiece.
Chineseporcelainand tea-drinking were the rage of fashionable Europe when Jean-tienne Liotard was born. He began painting tea and coffee sets in the last two decades of his life when age, changes in taste, and his political beliefs caused a decline in requests for thepastelportraits that were his specialty. He had, however, been including fruit and porcelain still lifes in some of his portraits since about 1740. Only five of his paintings of tea and coffee sets are known today.In this painting of tea-time disarray, a tray is set with six cups and saucers, a teapot, sugar bowl, milk jug, and a lidded vase perhaps containing an extra supply of tea leaves. A large bowl holding a teacup and saucer could also be used for dumping the slops of cold tea and used tea leaves. By the time Liotard painted this work in the late 1700s, tea-drinking had become fashionable among the middle as well as the upper classes. Liotard contrasted the luxurious materials of Chinese porcelain and silver with a cheaper tray of painted tin, known astle,that imitated Asianlacquer. Combining the transparent, reflective and brightly-patterned objects allowed the artist to portray strong visual contrasts.
Using metalpoint on light graypreparedpaper, Filippino Lippi drew a male saint holding a staff or possibly a stemmed cross. He probably sketched from a model, likely his youthful assistant or apprentice, and used the drawing primarily as a drapery study. Scholars know neither the exact purpose nor the date of the drawing, although it may relate to a 1503altarpiece. Few of Lippi's drawings directly relate to his paintings, and drawings for his altarpieces are scarce. This study represents a rare opportunity to witness his working method in the early years of the 1500s. On theversoLippi drew the same model from life as a study of two standing youths, with other, fainter studies along the edges of the paper. These two figures seem to relate directly to the figure ofSaint Sebastianin the altarpiece. The white leadhighlightsthat Lippi applied to both studies show that the model wasilluminatedby a light source at the left. Lippi also drew cast shadows at the figures' feet.
An intense expression and energetically rendered hair, beard, and pelt animate this vigorous study of a male head. This frowning man's prominent cheekbone and pronounced lines around the mouth emphasize the life implied by his parted lips, free-flowing hair, and focused gaze. Giovanni Agostino da Lodi's insistent diagonal hatching also enlivens the depiction. Such interest in physiognomy, combined with the curls and fur, which almost take on a life of their own, and the red-chalk technique indicate a close knowledge of Leonardo da Vinci's drawings. Da Lodi may have made this drawing as one of a series of physiognomic studies in response to similar drawings by Leonardo. In the depiction of the hair, this drawing displays asfumatoshared by Leonardo'sCaricatureof a Man with Bushy Hair,also in the Getty Museum. Almost all of Lodi's known drawings are red chalk studies of heads.
Pietro Longhi depicts the act of painting as an intimate scene of contemporary life. Longhi invites the viewer into a painter's studio, where the artist, surrounded by an array of his tools and props, creates a faithful likeness of a typical Venetian lady sitting for her portrait. Her costumed companion has removed his mask, which allowed him to pass incognito in public during the free-spirited months of Carnival.
Turning slightly to the right with her hands tucked deep inside a muff, a woman stands solemnly in a long cape. This drawing and another of a similar subject originally formed a single sheet and have remained together since being divided, probably in the 1800s. Pietro Longhi drew both as preliminary studies for two female figures who stand beside each other in the center of a painting.Longhi appears to have had the final composition already in mind, since he drew this figure slightly smaller than the other, anticipating the woman's position a little farther back in the finished work. The shadows at her feet also correspond to her placement in the final painting. The letters that appear to the right of the woman's head, beneath her muff, in her skirt, and on her apron, are notes about final color choices.The small sketch at the right margin of the drawing is a detail study for the hand of the woman in the pendant, a fraction of which is still visible at the far left of that sheet. Longhi drew various studies of heads on theverso.

The rest of the image remains on the far right of the pendant drawing. Longhi drew various studies of heads on theverso.
This painting illustrates the Roman widow Irene nursingSaint Sebastianback to health after he was discovered to be a Christian and shot with arrows by Roman archers. Writhing in pain, Saint Sebastian looks heavenward as Saint Irene pulls arrows from his pierced body. Vicente Lpez y Portaa dynamically composed the figure of Sebastian, with one arm tied above his head and his other arm held by an attendant, in order to more clearly display the wounds on his upper body and to allude to the martyrdom ofChrist. Sebastian's bent leg reveals the bleeding gash from which Irene has already removed one arrow. As she leans toward Sebastian's knee, she carefully pulls the saint's flesh in order to extract a second arrow. In theforeground, the depiction of the armor and weapons Sebastian wore as a military captain signals that this event occurred in ancient Rome.Lpez y Portaa's lusciouspaletteand creamy application of paint contrast with the drama and emotion of this religious story. Like Andrea Lilio's Figures Tending to the Wounded Saint Sebastian, this painting differs from representations that show the Saint bound to a tree or pillar, moments after the attack.
An artist in Lorenzo de Credi's large workshop probably made this painting under the master's direction, adapting elements from various other paintings. The apprentice or journeyman took the composition from analtarpiecebegun by another artist and finished by Lorenzo. The two landscapes in the background look quite different, since they derive from two different landscape traditions. The apprentice copied the landscape with a water mill on the right from an altarpiece by Hans Memling, whose Northern Europeans landscape paintings were being imported to Florence around this time, and took the landscape on the left from other works by Lorenzo. The anonymous artist adopted Leonardo da Vinci's early color scheme of delicate light blue, red, and pale violet for the Madonna's garments.
An imaginative architectural setting and brilliant light effects make this drawing an excellent example of Claude Lorrain's harbor scenes. He let the light-blue paper serve as a middle ground for both water and sky. By allowing the paper to peek through his washes in other places, he used its gentle color to subtly unify his composition.Like his near-contemporary Nicolas Poussin, Claude spent most of his life in Rome, where his art was strongly inspired by the Romancampagna, or countryside. He probably made this drawing as a study for a painting that was commissioned by the French ambassador in Rome and is now in a private collection. This sheet could also be a copy after that picture.
Claude Lorrain bathed this view of Tivoli in shimmering, translucent washes whose tonal range represents a continuum of light and shadow that both defines and dematerializes form. Characteristically, he silhouetted forms against expanses of golden Italian light. The pen-and-ink study on the verso may have been made first as a compositional outline for the drawing on the recto.More than thirty views of Tivoli, one of Claude's favorite subjects, survive. As always, he focused on the landscape rather than village architecture. He drew this study from nature, rather than composing it in the studio, and he may have used it in preparing a painting.According to a German painter colleague, Joachim von Sandrart, Tivoli played a role in Claude's decision to painten plein air(outdoors) rather than only in the studio:  [I]n Tivoli, in the wild rocks at the famous cascade . . . he found me painting from life and saw that I painted many works from nature itself, making nothing from imagination; this pleased himself so much that he applied himself eagerly to adopting the same method. 
The maiden Europa rests atop a white bull, unaware it is the god Jupiter in disguise. According to the tale in Ovid'sMetamorphoses, soon the animal will abduct her across the waves. Until then, she and her attendants festoon the seemingly innocent beast with flowers, while her blue drapery flutters in the breeze. In the upper right corner, a hazy poetic light illuminates her home city of Tyre, further evoking an idyllic antique world.Claude Lorrain is known for painting complicated images that achieve a tranquil balance. This scene appears bucolic, but his composition and details also hint of impending danger. Beyond the field of delicate flowers, for example, a craggy tower looms. The women fail to notice that the bull is poised in anticipation, already straightening one of his legs for flight. Whitecaps gather behind them on the darkening sea, the backdrop to Europa's fate.Even in his day, Claude was known for developing a style called the Ideal Landscape, in which nature on the canvas surpasses the real thing in its beauty, harmony, and refinement. Here he balances formal elements, like the upright trees, ship, and towers, against the open expanse of sea and sky. Offshore, he juxtaposes the huge galleon and all its impeccable detail in the rigging and carved decoration, with Europa still on land. The maritime theme also had a deeper resonance for Claude's contemporaries, as in art criticism, the abduction of Europa was compared to a ship leaving shore.French by birth, and working in Rome, Claude often went into the countryside to do studies of nature.  One of his hallmarks is the use of a unifying light, which gives this work a kind of gentle glow. The romance is punctuated by long shadows coming in from the left, distinctive of his favorite afternoon light, which help frame the drama at center stage.
Landscape painter Claude Lorrain rarely depicted scenes of everyday life. In this drawing set in central Italy, he expressed his interest in landscape by patterning the arrangement of figures on the lines of the mountainous background. In this expansive view, the jagged outlines of layered mountains echo the uneven row of workers turning the soil under an overseer's keen supervision.Pentimentiover the mountain peak at left show that Claude lowered its height to open the upper third of the sheet to sky. His spontaneity in rendering this scene suggests that it was probably sketched on the spot.Claude used both paper and chalk to infuse the scene with his characteristic atmospheric effects. Allowing the paper to show through, he succinctly sketched in the distant landscape with black chalk to contrast with the foreground's more sharply defined pen andwash.
The nineMuses, goddesses of poetic inspiration and the creative arts, surround the godApollo, who plays alira di braccio. They gather along the Castelian spring, which flows through the center of the scene. Famous in ancient times as a source of inspiration and learning, this place was appropriate for making music and contemplating the beauty of Mount Parnassus. An identifying inscription fills a cartouche beside each Muse.Claude Lorrain's friezelike composition, with figures balanced carefully along the foreground plane, reflects the influence of fellow Baroque artist Nicolas Poussin, Claude's contemporary and rival. The substantial forms of the Muses fill the scene, blocking much of the more delicate landscape that was Claude's most frequent subject. This drawing is unique in his work in showing large-scale figures accompanied by inscriptions.Scholars do not know why the artist made this drawing. Claude or a patron may have wanted to retain a copy of an earlier composition or, more likely, to remember the identification of the figures in the picture.
Two lascivious Jewish judges lean over a voluptuous nude female, bullying Susannah, the pretty and God-fearing wife of a rich and prominent Jew, as she bathes. Though she had thought she was hidden, these elders of the community had spied on her and entered her husband's private garden. She shies away in modesty, refusing their desires despite their threats to accuse her of adultery. When they later brought Susannah to trial, the youngprophetDanielproved her innocence, and her false accusers were sentenced to death in her place.Johann Carl Loth emphasized the contrast between the characters, depicting Susannah in the bright light of day, while the elders lurk in the shadows. Bold colors andchiaroscurofurther intensify the drama of the scene.
Framed by richly draped fabric, the Virgin Mary tenderly sits Christ on her lap. The couple who commissioned the panel look up at the child, meeting his eyes as he rewards their piety with a blessing. As the symbol of Christ's resurrection, the fig branch growing behind the curtain also reassures the donors of their own redemption.In the late 1400s, well-to-do families often commissioned such pictures for hanging in the home or the private chapel of a church. These panels served both as portraits and as testimonies to the donors' religious devotion.Lorenzo Lotto emphasized the contrast between the earthly and the spiritual realms by using a highlynaturalisticstyle for the couple and a more ideal, poetic rendering for the Virgin and child. With a flair for color betraying his Venetian origins, Lotto contrasted Mary's luminous blues and reds with the donors' more somber clothing.
As his horse paws the ground anxiously, Saint Martin leans down with his sword to cut his cape in half. The naked beggar looks up gratefully at the saint as he wraps the edge of the cloak around his body. A Christian saint who founded the first monasteries in France, Saint Martin enrolled in the Roman army before joining the Roman Catholic Church. According to legend, he once came upon a poor man on the road, shivering in the cold, and cut in half his military cloak to share it with him. That night Christ appeared to him in a dream wearing the piece of cloak he had given away.Using a very low viewpoint, Lorenzo Lotto focused attention on the figure of the saint and his mount. He used white and cream strokes ofbodycolorto create a powerful sense of movement in the sweeping stretch of fabric, the leaning saint, and the horse's arching foot and neck.
Furniture made entirely of metal was extremely rare in the 1700s as each individual piece had to be laboriously forged. Very few pieces still exist today. This console table, executed in the massive earlyNeoclassicalstyle, was almost certainly made by Pierre Deumier, a metal worker and a locksmith. In a French newspaper he advertised a table whose description closely matches this console. A similar console table appears in a 1766 drawing by the French architect Victor Louis. The Polish king Stanislas Auguste II commissioned it for a room in the royal palace in Warsaw. That table was delivered in 1769, but its present location is unknown.
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh [away the sin of the world].These words, inscribed in Latin on the scroll held bySaint John the Baptist, announce the coming ofChrist. Standing against a goldbackgroundand enclosed in aGothictrefoilframe, Saint John wears a hair shirt that represents his ascetic life of prayer and penance. Using carefully curved brushstrokes, Luca di Tomm described the woolly texture of Saint John's shirt and the unruly curliness of his hair and beard. Patternedpunchmarks form the decorativehaloaround the saint's head. TheOld TestamentprophetsElijahandDavid, who predicted the coming of theMessiah, occupy the upper corners of the frame. This panel was once part of analtarpiece, possibly for a church in Siena.
A complex arrangement of biblical and mythological figures fills this well-preserved sheet. In the lower right corner, Aurelio Luini quickly sketched the figure of anapostle, which he later used in afresco. Near the bottom of the page stand two larger figures of Mary Magdalene, each holding a jar of ointment with which to anoint the feet ofJesusChrist. Above, on the right, a woman--possibly the figure of Charity--holds a child in either arm. Scholars are unable to identify the other figures. The number in the top left of the sheet suggests that it once formed part of Luini's sketchbook.Luini swiftly drew the outline of each figure first in brown ink, deftly indicating the volume of the forms simply by varying the length and curve of the strokes. He then used brown wash and rich areas of whiteheighteningto create a subtle, luminous effect. Whitebodycolorgives the impression of a knee beneath a fold of fabric, adds texture to the drapery, andhighlightsthe figures' hair and faces.
This sweeping panorama view shows the city of Rome stretched out over a plain on a summer's day. A large oak tree on the left anchors theforegroundcompositionand leads the viewer's eye diagonally into the scene, past the tourist lounging on the grass in themiddle ground, to the dome of St. Peter's in the distance. Giovanni Battista Lusieri used black lead and chalk with extreme care and precision to create a luminous sheen that resembles graywash. The effect conveys the radiant Italian sunlight, as it cascades over theVaticanand surrounding buildings.Lusieri was particularly popular among the aristocratic English travelers who visited Italy as part of theirGrand Tourin the 1700s. They greatly admired his attention to detail, commissioning views such as this to remind of the places they had visited. Several contemporary accounts describe Lusieri as a slow but meticulous draftsman, who often drew and colored his works on site.
Sir William Hamilton, British envoy to the court of Naples from 1764 to 1800, wanted a painting of the panoramic view of the Bay of Naples from his apartment window. He sought out the Italian artist Giovanni Battista Lusieri, whose detailed drawings and watercolors of views of Naples and other Italian sites were popular withGrand Touristsin the 1780s and 1790s.Lusieri produced this sweeping view on six sheets of watercolor paper. Its clarity, purity of color, and accuracy of detail led many people to believe that Lusieri used a telescope orcamera obscurato record the intricacies, proportion, andperspectiveof his settings. He was a slow and painstaking draftsman; this drawing is one of his few important, completely finished works. He proceeded slowly, first drawing the entire scene in outline down to the smallest detail with a faint but hard pencil and then finishing and coloring the work on location, rather than in a studio. An English tourist wrote of Lusieri:  As an artist he was always slow in deliberation; but it was the tardiness of the most scrupulous accuracy; for he frequently laid on even his colours on the spot... 
The decapitated head of thegorgonMedusasurrounded by a wreath of vine leaves and grapes decorates the interior of thisred-figurepatera. A patera was a shallow bowl with a long handle used to make votive or funerary offerings to the gods. In this portrayal, two pairs of entwined snakes frame Medusa's calm, sad face. She wears white earrings and adiademwith uprightpalmettesin added white and yellow set in her hair. The back of the bowl is simply edged with a wreath of laurel leaves and berries. Akourosor standing nude youth, whose arms are raised to support the bowl, forms the handle of the vessel.A completely preserved patera like this one is quite rare. As this type of vessel is well known in bronze examples, the ocher yellow paint that covers the body of the youth was probably meant to simulate polished bronze or gold.
The Minotaur, a monster with a bull's head and a human body, was the son of the Cretan queen and a bull for which she had developed an irresistible passion. The Minotaur lived in a labyrinth on Crete and devoured human sacrifices of youths and maidens sent as tribute from Athens. When the Greek heroTheseusfinally killed the monster, he freed Athens from this horrible burden. The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur was very popular on Athenian vases in the late 500s B.C., possibly due to the Athenian connection with the myth. In this rendition, Theseus plunges his sword through the monster's neck while the freed youths and maidens watch. The youths are shown nude, in poses similar to those found on contemporarykouroi. In his depiction of the encounter, the artist stressed the Minotaur's bestial nature. The Minotaur's weapon is a rock, seen clutched in his hoof-like hand, whereas civilized Theseus fights with a sword. The back of the vase shows two youths mounted on horses, greeted by family members as they return home. Such a scene of returning youths and warriors was a frequent one in Athenian vase-painting. The youths may be mythological figures such as the Dioskouroi, or they may simply be mortals.
For Walker Evans and James Agee, two gallant men, together in life, now united immortal in death. Now they are both gone and we are left thoroughly alone. One would have thought that the world itself would end with this single man's [Evans's] death, so great was his vision, so powerful his art. The exalting inscription around the border of this image by Danny Lyon pays homage to the photographer Walker Evans and the writer James Agee. This photograph of two brooding boys was taken while Lyon was on a trip to visit the boyhood home of Agee. In theforeground, one boy clings to a puppy, giving him a look of innocence, while behind him another boy sits in the driver's seat of a convertible.Civil rights activists like Lyon valued the work of Evans and Agee for the sensitive way in which it represented the harsh life of poor and disenfranchised people. Evans is particularly known for the numerous poignant images that he made documenting the effects of the Depression in the American South. In 1941, Evans and Agee collaborated on the bookLet Us Now Praise Famous Men,which depicted the daily lives of three tenant farmer families in rural Alabama.
The subject of the photograph is the silhouette of the photographer's shadow on the plate glass window of a cafe. His outline forms the division between what can be seen inside the restaurant and the reflection of the street scene behind the photographer. Even in outline form, certain details of the photographer's figure can be deciphered: the cowboy hat he wears and the distinctive shape on the right side of his head that indicates a camera held up to his left eye. Visible in the silhouetted hat brim, the restaurant's wall clock clearly registers the time,11:37.Danny Lyon inscribed a dedication,  For Lewis Hine,  visible in the lower left border around the print. Hine's socially conscious photographs, particularly hisSelf-Portrait with Newsboy,influenced Lyon.
Two chariots seen in a frontal view decorate this Athenian black-figure psykter or wine cooler. Each chariot carries a driver and a warrior whose heads are just visible over the edge of the chariot car. On one side Skythian archers, identified by their distinctive tall caps, hold the outside trace horses, and on the other side, fully armed warriors flank the chariot. The Greeks used psykters to chill the wine at a symposium or drinking party. Wine diluted with water was poured into the psykter, whose wide bulbous body was then floated inside a larger vessel filled with snow or cold water. Scholars believe that this is the earliest complete psykter to have survived from antiquity.
The Campagna, the lowland plain that surrounds Rome in the Lazio (Latium) region of central Italy, occupies an area of about eight hundred square miles (2,100 square km). This region was a frequent subject for painters. Robert Macpherson himself made bucolic painted views of the Campagna before turning to the camera for this representation.The ruins that march across the rolling countryside are the remains of the Roman aqueduct built by the Emperor Claudius. Its abandoned, crumbling arches contrast with the signs of an active farming life in the foreground. Although Macpherson rarely included people in his photographs, the human presence is evident on the well-worn Via Appia Nuova, the ancient Roman road winding its way into and quickly out of the frame at the lower right corner. The farmhouse at the center right edge represents more current evidence of human activity. In his highly detailed rendering, Macpherson represented the coexistence of the historical past and present.
In this painting, Nicolaes Maes almost exactly copied Albrecht Drer's 1504 engraving of the Nativity. Maes simply widened the house to the left, provided new poses for the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, and added the four shepherds that give the painting its new subject. The harmony of blacks, browns, and whites that he chose emphasizes the painting's origin in a print. He successfully used the fluid medium of oil paint to render such textures as the stable's wooden door, the exposed bricks, and the thatched roof.
InTorquato Tasso's1581 epic poemGerusalemme Liberata(Jerusalem Delivered), the legendary medieval knight Rinaldo is bewitched by the beautiful sorceress Armida and lulled into a life of easy sensuality on the Fortunate Isles. His friends, the knights Carlo and Ubaldo, enter her garden and break her spell by showing Rinaldo a magic mirror-shield. His military spirit reawakened, he later rejoins his companions in the enchanted forest.Some seventy years after the famous book was written, theBaroqueartist Francesco Maffei applied his expressive brushwork and rich color to enhance the drama of Tasso'sRenaissanceepic.
The medieval Christian knight Rinaldo has entered the enchanted forest, where monstrous apparitions have prevented his men from gathering wood to build their war-machines. Earlier, his companions had rescued him from the sorceress Armida's garden, and now they in turn require his assistance. Suddenly, hundreds of treenymphsappear, surrounding Rinaldo, and the sorceress Armida appears from within a large myrtle tree, begging the knight to renew their love. His sword unsheathed, Rinaldo advances to strike the tree, thus overcoming the enchantment and enabling the Crusaders' liberation of Jerusalem to proceed.Combining themes of chivalric love with tales of Christian heroism,Torquato Tasso's1581 epic poem, Gerusalemme Liberata(Jerusalem Delivered), celebrated theFirst Crusadeof 1099 nearly five hundred years after it had taken place. Some seventy years after the famous book was written, theBaroqueartist Francesco Maffei applied his energetic brushwork and rich color to enhance the drama of Tasso'sRenaissanceepic.
Most Renaissance chests were given to newly betrothed couples to celebrate their marriages and furnish their new homes.The recessed flat tops, curving acanthus leaves, and straight sides show the influence of classical Roman sarcophagi. Both chests are supported by crouching lions and decorated with deeply carved, scrolling foliage and pronounced architectural motifs. The bizarre grimacing masks and grotesque figures with elegantly contorted forms are typical of decoration in the Mannerist style. Each chest was carved from a single tree trunk.
This elegantly proportioned table would have served as a small desk or occasional table for use in a library or sitting room. Giuseppe Maggiolini, one of Italy's most renowned cabinetmakers in the 1700s, produced thisNeoclassicalpiece with its finemarquetryscenes. His superb craftsmanship is particularly evident on the top, which displays a trompe l'oeil architectural drawing of a palace faade, flanked on either side by a trophy of architectural tools hanging from a ribbon. An inscription at the bottom of the trompe l'oeil drawing dedicates this work to Laura Visconti. Genealogical records list only one woman of this name, the daughter of an Italian aristocrat who lived in the 1700s; this table may have been made as a gift for her.
WhenChristpaused to rest at Jacob's Well, a holy site for both Samaritans and Jews, he requested a drink of water from a Samaritan woman. Though initially surprised, since Jews and Samaritans were traditional enemies, she became increasingly intrigued by the knowledgeable and all-seeing visitor as they talked. Believing him to be aprophet, she spoke of looking forward to the coming of theMessiah.  I am he, the one who is speaking to you, Jesusreplied.Against the soberclassicalruins, Alessandro Magnasco gave the scene an expressive urgency with his characteristically agitated drapery and rapidly sketched, attenuated musculature. Magnasco took the subjects of both this painting and itspendant,Noli Me Tangere,from theNew Testamentgospelof John. A collaborator probably painted thebackgroundofantiqueruins in both pictures.
Against an architectural backdrop, Mary Magdalene becomes the first witness to Christ'sResurrection. Since he had not yet ascended to heaven,Jesusinstructed her not to touch him(Noli me tangerein Latin) and asked her to go to his disciples with the message that he had risen (John 20:11-18).Alessandro Magnasco filled this tall canvas with picturesqueclassicalruins, whose shapes echo the curves of the figures' theatrical poses. His energetic brushwork, nervous, sketchy style, and lively approach create around the risenChrista flurry of drapery that seems to have a life of its own, adding to the drama of the miraculous event.
Nymphsandsatyrsparticipate in an ancient pagan feast celebratingBacchus, the god of wine. Twisting, dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments, the small figures engage in unrestrained revelry at odds with the staidbackgroundofclassicalruins. The dancing figures convey a sense of irrationality, as if the classical statuary had come alive to re-live the bacchanalian rituals of the past.Alessandro Magnasco used monochromatic colors for his painting, adding blue accents to represent swirling drapery. He created figures using quick, agitated strokes of paint with daubs of white forhighlights. Magnasco made this painting and itspendant,The Triumph ofVenus,in Milan early in his career. His collaborator Clemente Spera probably painted the architectual ruins.
At the right,Venus, the goddess of love, rides in a processional chariot, assisted by blindfoldedputti.Nymphs,satyrs, and other figures run, blow trumpets, or lie in languid poses on the ground. In thebackground, ghost-like figures swirl or lounge in front of an eerie landscape. Alessandro Magnasco painted his figures with nervous brushstrokes, adding an electric energy to the uninhibited revelry taking place amid elaborate ancient ruins.Magnasco probably painted this canvas and itspendant,Bacchanale,while in Milan early in his career. His collaborator Clemente Spera probably painted the architectural views.
Despite the drawing's title, the monumental trees at the center are clearly the focus of the composition. Twisting sinuously, they seem more alive, more vital, and more organic than the diminutive human figures sprinkled throughout the scene. Isaac Major achieved his effects in watercolor without relying on an underlying pen or pencil sketch for guidance.This sheet is one of a group of landscapes by Major called the  indigo  drawings, after the bluewashhe applied with a brush. He envisioned the scene almost completely in monochrome. While a single color, blue, suggests the entire range of light, shadow, and color, he added touches of green, yellow, and reddish watercolor as appropriate.The rugged terrain shows the influence of Roelandt Savery and Pieter Stevens, after whose works Major made a number of engravings. The black chalk squaring indicates that he may have made this drawing in preparation for a print, although none is known.
Asatyrholding a drinking cup decorates the interior of this Athenian red-figure cup.  Satyrs, part-human, part-animal companions ofDionysos, the god of wine, were a popular and fitting decoration for cups like this one intended for use at a symposion or drinking party. The decoration on this cup provides a good example of the reason that by the early 400s B.C. most Athenian vase-painters preferred to work in thered-figure technique. As this moving satyr shows, Greek artists of this period were extremely interested in accurately depicting the human body and its changes in musculature and posture. Theblack-figure technique, in which all internal markings were incised equally through the black silhouette of the figure, was inherently limited in its ability to do this. The red-figure technique with its painted internal detail was more suitable for the task.On this vase, Makron used heavy lines of black glaze, actually raised from the surface of the vase, for large contours of the body. He then applied lines of diluted glaze, which fired brown rather than black, for smaller musculature. This varied intensity of line enabled the artist to give a sense of mass and three-dimensionality to the satyr.
A reveler dances away the night, holding onto his cup with one hand and his walking stick with the other. Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use atsymposiaor drinking parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of revelry and drinking. Consuming the wine in the cup revealed the joyous dancer at its bottom. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented a compositional problem for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to place upright figures in this limited, curving space. Some artists placed decidedly linear figures in the circular space or drew a line across the circle in order to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. Others, like the artist Makron on this cup, clearly were trying to work out innovative compositions. By means of carefully positioned limbs, he managed to give the dancing reveler an almost circular outline, echoing its frame.
The woman on this Romano-Egyptian mummy portrait stares at the viewer with large, expressive eyes. Her high and elaborately curled hairstyle, emulating the fashionable women in the royal court in Rome, indicates that this portrait was painted during theFlaviandynasty. The woman's rich jewelry shows her elite status. Her earrings and triple necklace appear to be made of gold, pearls, and emeralds. The emerald was a highly prized jewel in the Roman period, and Egypt was the main source of the gem.Although the place of origin of this portrait is not known for certain, other portraits attributed to the Malibu Painter have been found at the site of Hawara in Egypt. And the rounded form of the top of this panel matches others found there. Hawara was the cemetery for nearby Arsinoe, the main city in the Fayum, where the woman in this portrait may have lived.This colorful portrait has survived the centuries remarkably well but not unscathed. The left side of the panel was broken off. And sometime after the portrait was excavated, areas around the brows, the hair, and the shaded side of the neck were repainted.
Man Ray made this picture to document an assemblage displayed at his second one-person show at the Daniel Gallery in New York City in 1916. Visitors to the exhibition were reportedly frustrated by the inoperative doorbell in the assemblage. The artist delighted in such surprises and hoped they would lead viewers to find their own meanings in his work.
As Man Ray told it in his autobiography, one day in 1915 the French artist Marcel Duchamp appeared at the door of his house, and despite a language barrier the two artists quickly recognized one another as kindred spirits. A lifelong friendship was begun, and they collaborated on a variety of projects.In 1917 Duchamp madeThe Water Mill Within Glider, a painting on glass now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as a study for his workLarge Glassof 1915 to 1923. Man Ray made this photograph later in Paris after Duchamp had framed theWater Millfor delivery to his buyer. Lying flat on the table, Duchamp posed in a way that makes him an integral part of the composition. An inscription on the back of the print indicates that the image of the sculpture was cut out of the photographic print by Duchamp, who trimmed away the background of the studio, then turned the picture vertically to make it seem as though he were bracing the glass.
French artist Marcel Duchamp, known for his notorious 1912 paintingNude Descending a Staircase, first arrived in New York in the summer of 1915. Despite a language barrier, he and Man Ray quickly recognized one another as kindred spirits and a lifelong friendship ensued. Duchamp's rejection of the artist's role as tastemaker and his fascination with unusual media dovetailed with Man Ray's developing artistic philosophy, and the two collaborated on several projects. Their desire to foster and promote progressive art led them to found theSocit Anonymewith collector Katherine Dreier in 1920.
Man Ray studied life drawing at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. He may have made this nude, more conventional than his other photographs of the 1920s, as a reference for a painting or as an exercise to gain confidence with the camera.
Made in the same year that suffragettes won the right to vote in the United States, this photograph flouts convention by showing a woman smoking, with her head thrown back in abandon. Man Ray's equally daring composition shows the model from an unusual vantage point, with the image centered on the crown of her head.
This Rayograph presents a constellation of sequins scattered across a circle of light, a reminder of the simplicity of thephotogramprocess. Man Ray probably made it with little preconception of the final result; he spontaneously employed materials at hand. The work forces the viewer to draw upon his or her own experiences and imagination to give the image meaning, whether picturing a crater-pocked orb or a pocketful of tears.
In 1913 Tsuguharu Fujita left Tokyo for Paris, where he became a fixture in the artist's quarter of Montparnasse and a successful painter. Man Ray arrived seven years later and soon became the celebrated portraitist of Parisian artists during this period. Everyone who was anyone in Paris sat for Man Ray and was assured of a place in the Modernist pantheon because of the association with the famous photographer.
Nine years before the Museum of Modern Art opened in New York, theSocit Anonyme, which Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp cofounded with collector Katherine Dreier in 1920, organized exhibitions of works by contemporary masters. Man Ray reluctantly served as photographer for the society, photographing affiliated artists as he did here in a double portrait of Duchamp and the American painter Joseph Stella. Man Ray craftily included himself in the picture by hanging his photographWoman Smoking a Cigaretteabove their heads.
One of Man Ray's guiding principles was  to do the things that one is not supposed to do,  and here it seems he has used the camera to make a picture of something intangible, an emotion. Man Ray explored photography's potential in the realm of abstraction, photographing a cloud of smoke gathering around a found-object sculpture in his New York studio. By manipulating his camera, he blurred the subject beyond recognition and created a sense of velocity and disequilibrium. The enigmatic title denies the existence of a recognizable subject in the photograph. Unknown to the viewer is the fact thatAnxiety (L'Inquietude)is the name of the sculpture in the photograph, making this a craftily anti-documentary document of the three-dimensional piece.
Man Ray's bold simplicity in this portrait of Berenice Abbott, who assisted Man Ray in his studio and later became an accomplished photographer, anticipated the style that would bring him fame in Paris. Her disembodied head and hands appear to float against the large expanse of the plain background.
Fascinated by the game of chess and an avid player, Man Ray designed several chessboards, including this one from 1920. Here he photographed himself playing, lit from below. Chess was a popular preoccupation with Surrealist artists and with Man Ray's frequent collaborator Marcel Duchamp. A 1945 exhibition devoted to chess included some of Man Ray's works.
Using one of Man Ray's earliest portraits of Rrose Slavy (Marcel Duchamp dressed as a woman) Duchamp made a label that he affixed to an empty perfume bottle to create his 1921 artworkBelle Haleine, Eau de Voilette(Beautiful Breath, Veil Water). The image of the perfume bottle appeared on the cover of the sole issue of Man Ray and Duchamp's journalNew York Dada, published the winter before Man Ray left for Paris.
Man Ray made this self-portrait in 1921, the year that he moved to Paris, where he embarked on the most creative period of his artistic career. The pipe he holds later figured prominently in several Parisian works.
Famous for his personal style and ubiquitous presence as much as for his artistic talents, Jean Cocteau met Man Ray in late 1921 and became one of his first portrait subjects in Paris. In the beginning of the following year, Man Ray made this photograph in the drawing room of the house where Cocteau lived with his mother. Centered within a picture frame, Cocteau's earnest face echoes the sculpture behind him.
The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, quickly became an internationally recognized symbol of Paris and of modernity. This surprising portrayal of the steel-girdered monument shows its massive legs poised for action. The image's unfocused quality was part calculation and part chance. By taking liberties with the French icon and prominently signing his work, Man Ray proudly proclaimed his arrival on the artistic landscape of Paris.
I was greeted with a broad warm smile by Gertrude Stein, massive, in a woolen dress and woolen socks with comfortable sandal. . . . I had brought my camera. . . . Perhaps I was impressed by the staidness of her personality but it never occurred to me to try any fantasy or acrobatics with her physiognomy. . . .Man Ray thus described his first portrait session with the writer Gertrude Stein in 1921, when he made this image. His portraits of Stein were the first of her to appear in print, providing her readers with some idea of her appearance. He photographed her frequently over the next ten years.
The American author Sinclair Lewis was at the peak of his career when Man Ray photographed him during a visit to Paris. The portrait publicized his just-completed novelArrowsmith, for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1926, though he declined the honor. The two men shared an ambivalence about America: Lewis harbored an affection for the American way of life that he satirized in his novels but, like Man Ray, was impatient with the provincialism and commercialism of his native country.
One of Man Ray's early commissions as a photographer was to make a portrait of the Italian-born Marquise Casati, a free-spirited aristocrat who lived much of her life in France and whose personal style involved disheveled hair and raccoon-like eyes. In this portrait, the Marquise is visible through the panes of a display case holding an exotic artificial plant. She performs for the camera, appearing as a kind of gypsy sorceress with her lacy shawl and crystal ball, in which the photographer's reflection is visible. She forms a part of a still life, herself a curiosity as much as the objects on display.
Ravaged by bronchitis and pneumonia, Marcel Proust spent the last night of his life dictatingmanuscriptchanges for a section of his famous novelRemembrance of Things Past.Man Ray did not know Proust, but he had become such an important photographer that mutual friends dispatched him to the celebrated French author's bedside to make a final portrait two days after his death. The side view associates Man Ray's photograph with a tradition of postmortem photography dating back to the inception of the medium.
The photograph gives the sense of filmstrips cascading from the top of the picture as if dropped by someone above. In the lower left-hand corner, a glass negative of Kiki appears to shatter as it hits the bottom of the composition. In this image, made the year he discovered the Rayograph technique, Man Ray symbolically discarded the more traditional methods of picture making represented by the filmstrips and glass negative.
Shakespeare and Company publishers sent James Joyce to Man Ray to have press photographs made for the imminent release ofUlysses. Although Man Ray remembered that Joyce  seemed to consider the sitting a terrible nuisance,  he managed to secure this handsome likeness of the author.
 In the early days Gertrude Stein brought [artist] Juan Gris to my studio. He came prepared to be photographed with a high white stiff collar, as if for a family portrait,  recalled Man Ray of the circumstance that led to this portrait. Indeed, Gris's stiff and formal pose implies that he was completely ill at ease with the prospect of having his likeness made.
Two hands, one bright white, the other a muted gray, are poised either to stop or to start the gyroscope at center. The hand at right is dark because of its distance from the photographic paper during the exposure. Because Rayographs, orphotograms, are made without the use of a camera, they defy the expected objectivity of the photograph. While traced by light from actual three-dimensional objects, these images depict an internal landscape or psychological tension rather than an external reality.
This Rayogram made from a spiral of cut paper deceives the viewer through the ambiguity of space that it presents. While the form suggests a three-dimensional shape that has been laid down and exposed on the photographic paper, the play of light and shadows causes planes to recede and emerge in a dizzyingly successful manipulation of spatial relations.Man Ray's included this image in his 1922 portfolioLes champs dlicieux(The delicious fields).
 When all that one calls art was covered with rheumatism, the photograph lit the millions of lights of his lamp, and the sensitive paper absorbed by degrees black,  wrote Tristan Tzara in his preface for a portfolio of twelve images by Man Ray that was published in December 1922 under the titleLes champs dlicieux(The delicious fields).While a spiral reveals its familiar shape, no other element in this abstract image is recognizable, nor was it meant to be. Rather, light, shadow, and forms are the photograph's subject.
When Man Ray moved to Paris, he was greeted by his friend and artistic compatriot Marcel Duchamp, who introduced him to members of the Dada circle of writers and artists. The two men had collaborated in a number of creative endeavors in New York, including the creation of a female alter-ego for Duchamp named Rrose Slavy (a pun on the French pronunciationEros, c'est la vie Sex, that's life ). Man Ray photographed Duchamp several times as Rrose Slavy.
In making this still life using theclich verreprocess, Man Ray included a drawing based on a photograph he took of the Marquise Luisa Casati at her first portrait sitting in 1922. The Marquise, an eccentric Italian aristocrat who was an important patron of vanguard artists, was one of Man Ray's earliest portrait commissions in Paris. During the 1920s, Man Ray photographed her at home in her salon, surrounded by her favorite objects, and in costume at a masquerade ball.
In a 1924 article onDada, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes wrote,  Man Ray is a subtle chemist of mysteries who sleeps with the metrical fairies of spirals and steel wool. He invents a new world and photographs it to prove that it exists. In this large print, Man Ray used net, wire, and wood shavings to create an animated abstract composition that defies direct interpretation. The spiralmotifseen at the top of the picture often appears in the Rayographs as well as in Man Ray's paintings and assemblages.
In his Rayographs or photograms, Man Ray was sympathetic to the spirit ofSurrealism, using objects from the known world to create an ambiguous and imaginary mental landscape. In this combination, alphabet stencils are scattered like bullets shot from the revolver that glows ominously against the black backdrop. The letters defy rational interpretation, refusing to assemble themselves into recognizable words. Two circular shapes and an unidentifiable form next to theSbalance the composition while denying any literal meaning.
Man Ray was an admirer of the paintings of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and made a series of photographs, inspired by Ingres's languorous nudes, of the model Kiki in a turban. Painting thef-holes of a stringed instrument onto the photographic print and then rephotographing the print, Man Ray altered what was originally a classical nude. He also added the titleLe Violon d'Ingres, a French idiom that means  hobby.  The transformation of Kiki's body into a musical instrument with the crude addition of a few brushstrokes makes this a humorous image, but her armless form is also disturbing to contemplate. The title seems to suggest that, while playing the violin was Ingres's hobby, toying with Kiki was a pastime of Man Ray. The picture maintains a tension between objectification and appreciation of the female form.
At about the same time he was establishing himself as a photographer in Paris, Man Ray met Kiki (Alice Prin), a celebrated cabaret singer in Montparnasse, the city's bohemian quarter. Although she worked as a model for painters, she was hesitant to pose for the camera, considering the photographic image too clinical. Man Ray convinced her otherwise and photographed her in a style inspired by the paintings of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.
A popular vaudeville performer of the 1920s and 1930s took the stage name of Barbette. He first began dressing as a woman when hired to replace a female tightrope walker. Barbette soon devised his own act, walking the high wire and performing trapeze stunts in elegant gowns, then removing his wig at the end of the show to reveal his true gender. Man Ray photographed the performer applying stage makeup with his face reflected in two mirrors, a composition that parallels the dual personas of performer and man.
At the time this picture was made, Gertrude Stein had not yet achieved literary success, though she had already been immortalized by Pablo Picasso in a 1906 painting. Here she poses for a portrait sculpture being carved by the American artist Jo Davidson. In 1922 Man Ray photographed Stein for the first time and was granted exclusive rights to photograph her until 1930.
This elegant photograph of Kiki (Alice Prin) posing with an African ceremonial mask invites the viewer to contrast the two elongated faces. Man Ray's title is a playful reference to the black-and-white photographic process as well as to the two heads. The image reflects the contemporary vogue for the arts of Africa and Man Ray's lifelong interest in masks.
The elements Man Ray used to create this image are not readily evident, but the rapid alternation of light and dark on the page stimulate the eye. The stippled spots of black interact with the texture of the paper to activate the surface of the print and suggest positive and negative space.
In this Rayograph, Man Ray explored the luminous properties of a discarded, diamond-patterned snakeskin, paralleling the shape of the filmstrip almost invisibly arching through the darkness on the right margin of the print.
In his autobiography, Man Ray wrote that he discovered thephotogramtechnique--which he renamed Rayograph--by accident in 1921, while developing photographs for French couturier Paul Poiret. Rayographs allowed Man Ray to make photographic images without a camera.The process, whose results were calledphotogenic drawingsin the nineteenth century andphotogramsin the twentieth, involves placing an object on photographic paper, which is then exposed to a light source. Since they were made without a negative, Rayographs--like paintings and drawings--are one-of-a-kind objects.
Man Ray wanted to distract viewers from the literal interpretation of his photographs and to encourage a more subjective and personal understanding of imagery.  After all, photography is not restricted to the mere role of a copyist,  he said in 1926.
California-born Rose Rolando, who married Mexican artist Miguel Covarrubias, was a modern dancer and choreographer strongly influenced by non-Western cultures. Man Ray posed her next to a winepress screw, a prop that he found in an antique shop. The sculptor Constantin Brancusi also frequently used the screw as a prop in his photographs and sometimes kept it in his studio.
From a very young age, Florence Meyer lived her life among artists and practiced her violin in the studio of sculptor Constantin Brancusi. She later became a dancer and, after moving to Los Angeles, pursued photography with the occasional instruction of Man Ray. Man Ray may have made the masks in the background of this image.
Judging from his inclusion of this image in other photographic compositions, Man Ray must have consideredTearsone of his most successful photographs. A cropped version of it with a single eye also appears as the first plate in a 1934 book of his photographs.Like the emotive expression of a silent screen star in a film still, the woman's plaintive upward glance and mascara-encrusted lashes seem intended to invoke wonder at the cause of her distress. The face, however, belongs not to a real woman but to a fashion mannequin who cries tears of glistening, round glass beads; the effect is to aestheticize the sentiment her tears would normally express. Man Ray made this photograph in Paris around the time of his breakup with his lover Lee Miller, and the woman's false tears may relate to that event in the artist's life.
This display of brilliantly colored butterflies provided an ideal showcase for the rich hues of the carbro-color process process. Always interested in new ways of manipulating the photographic medium, Man Ray made a number of color prints in the 1930s.
Something crawled across my foot in the darkroom and I let out a yell and turned on the light.Thus began Lee Miller, Man Ray's artistic collaborator and lover, in a 1975 interview recalling her version of how the two artists discovered thesolarizationprocess. Miller continued,  I never did find out what it was, a mouse or what. Then I quickly realized that the film was totally exposed: there in the development tank, ready to be taken out, were a dozen practically fully-developed negatives of a nude against a black background . . . Man Ray grabbed them, put them in the hypo, and looked at them later . . . The background and the image couldn't heal together, so there was a line left which he called 'solarization.' While working with Miller, Man Ray made numerous photographs exploring the effects of tone reversal in solarization. This image, part of a series of calla lilies, shows the thin black line that separates areas where reversal has occurred from areas where it has not.
Georges Braque, who together with Picasso originated the art movement known as Cubism, appears as a stupendous, awe-inspiring head, radiating like the sun. Man Ray solarized the portrait to achieve the effect of a visible aura around Braque's head. Man Ray's friend as well as his peer in the pantheon of early twentieth-century artists, Braque was one of the leading artists of the day.
In the same year that he completed the portfolioElectricitcommissioned by the Paris electric company CPDE, Man Ray photographed the Eiffel Tower at night, illuminated by Fernand Jacopozzi's lighting design. The photograph nearly makes the viewer believe that this artificial firmament is a real heavenly scene. Shooting stars on decorous trajectories define the recognizable shape, but otherwise Man Ray transformed the celebrated monument into a delicately graphic image. He used this image as the basis forLa Ville, a multiple exposure that was included in theElectricitportfolio.
Much of Man Ray's work was motivated by his desire to create a momentary shock in the viewer that would arrest rational thought processes and stimulate fresh ways of seeing. This piece, with its awkward juxtaposition of hands, feet, and buttocks, shocks the viewer in a more conventional sense as well. Man Ray admired the writings of the Marquis de Sade, and this image evokes that author's sexual predilections and strong opposition to clerical influence in secular matters.
Man Ray made a series of photographs of calla lilies in 1930, one of which appeared in his 1934 book of photographs. The solarized blooms, however, did not find favor with the august American critic Lewis Mumford, who wrote in theNew Yorker,  A photographer who can deal intelligently with the human face should not waste his time photographing calla lilies so they will look like a drawing by a second-rate academician. 
In 1931 the Paris electric company CPDE commissioned Man Ray to produce a series of images promoting the personal uses of electricity. The resulting portfolio,lectricit, included pictures of the uses of electricity in each room of a house, as inCuisine(Kitchen). The whimsical print lent a familiarity and friendliness to the mysterious power marketed by CPDE.Thelectricitportfolio included ten Rayographs reproduced as photogravures. The company released it in an edition of five hundred for distribution to top CPDE executives and special customers.
Man Ray and Lee Miller made this image by combining a lens-based photograph and a Rayograph, or photograph. Like many of Man Ray's images, this one includes a combination of elements, including a female torso. It was one of a series Miller and Man Ray created for the Paris electric company CPDE, who commissioned a brochure to promote the use of electricity in everyday life. The brochure, a successful joining of commercial and artistic motives, consisted of ten Rayographs reproduced asphotogravures.
The Eiffel Tower at night, illuminated by Fernand Jacopozzi's fanciful lighting design, explodes with an overlay of neon advertisements in Man Ray's dynamic, multiple-exposure print. Fragments of words float through the photograph like snatches of overheard conversations. Man Ray included this image in a portfolio he produced for the Paris electric company CPDE to promote the personal uses of electricity.
In 1931 la Compagnie Parisienne de Distribution d'Electricit (CPDE) commissioned Man Ray to produce a series of images promoting the personal consumption of electricity. The resulting portfolio,Electricit, included ten photographs reproduced asphotogravuresin an edition of 450 for distribution to top executives and special customers.The series is a vibrant visual evocation of the company's commitment to increased domestic use of electricity. This image is aphotogramof an electric fan. By nudging it during the exposure and covering it with a web of rippling lines, Man Ray suggested the excitation of the electrical current and the whir of the fan. The use of Rayographs, Man Ray's term for hisphotograms, for this portfolio may have seemed fitting to him, since the images themselves were created by exposing objects on photographic paper to an electrical light source in his darkroom.
In 1931 the Paris electric company CPDE commissioned Man Ray to produce a series of images promoting the personal uses of electricity. The resulting portfolio,lectricit, included ten Rayographs reproduced asphotogravures.Le monde(The world), a picture of the moon above an electrical cord, suggests that even celestial bodies are dependent on CPDE for their illumination.
 The [solarization] technique allowed me to get away from photography, to get away from banality...and here was a chance to produce a photograph that would not look like a photograph,  Man Ray told an interviewer in 1964.Man Ray used solarization to give an otherworldly quality to his subjects. The Sabattier effect, more commonly known as solarization, is a photographic technique closely associated with him. Named for the man who discovered it in 1862, the effect involves exposing a photographic print to light during the development process to create an unpredictable reversal of tones in some areas, especially around the edges of a subject.
Always interested in new ways to manipulate the medium, Man Ray made a number of color prints in the 1930s. Never satisfied with prescribed results, the artist tampered with the carbon transfer process to achieve a pastel-colored image, which he then outlined in pencil.
Man Ray showed himself in profile in this self-portrait, intently adjusting the focal range on his view camera as if for a portrait session. He directs the camera in the photograph at the audience, while the camera taking his picture remains invisible. The touch of Man Ray's hand on the focusing ring serves as a reminder of the human artistry required to make photographs, a departure from his more accidental approach to creating works in other media. Man Ray solarized the print, using a process indelibly associated with him.
Man Ray used separate negatives of a nude torso and a photographer's lamp to create this dreamscape. Shadows and reflections make the subject of the work ambiguous: the light bulb in the center could be a doorknob or a crystal ball. The piece is particularly successful in creating the illusion of three-dimensionality on flat paper.
The model's exaggerated pose displays his torso in a sinuousS-curve interrupted only by a fashioned undergarment. Shadows andsolarizationfurther emphasize the contours of the torso and suggest the radiation of body heat. This is a highly tactile image, from the way the lighting emphasizes body hair to the slight impression on the skin left by the man's undergarment, rolled down to reveal the curve of his hip.Though female nudes are plentiful in his work, Man Ray made very few male figure studies. For that reason and the model's resemblance to Man Ray, the image has sometimes been thought to be a self-portrait. Another picture taken at this session, however, reveals that the model is not Man Ray, who may have enjoyed the idea of having a body double.
The December 1933 issue of the Surrealist journalMinotaurepublished this stylish still life. The composition centers on a bust of the artist surrounded by a constellation of circular objects and hands, with Man Ray's photographLarmes (Tears)in the background. The picture seems slightly didactic, perhaps intended to indoctrinate the audience into the mystery and significance of the photographer and his creations.
In the mid-1930s Man Ray tried his hand at color photography using the carbro process (carbon plus bromide), created by making three separate photographs of a subject through a red, a green, and a blue filter. The proof print shown here represents one step of the carbro print process.Man Ray made this still life for the cover of his 1934 book,Photographs by Man Ray 1920 Paris 1934, which was intended to present the range of his photographic work to an American audience. He included in the composition abustof himself as well as curios from his studio, some of which appear in his works. He may have included the model, who bears a significant resemblance to Man Ray's former lover and studio apprentice Lee Miller, to suggest that he counted Miller among his creations.

Using a gramophone record, Man Ray created this elegantly simple Rayograph. The searchlight shapes emitting from the tiny center hole give the distinct impression of the disk spinning, capturing both the motion and the faintly whirring sound of the record's movement.
According to Man Ray, artist Max Ernst brought to his attention a group of three-dimensional models at the Institut Henri Poincar in Paris. The forms, made of metal, wire, plaster, and wood and meant to illustrate algebraic equations, made a great impression on Man Ray, and he decided to photograph them. The formulas accompanying them meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature. The fact that they were man-made were of added importance to me,  wrote Man Ray of these objects, which he used as points of departure for a series of twenty paintings that he made in Los Angeles.

Man Ray became acquainted with Pablo Picasso in the early 1920s in Paris and made a number of portraits of him over the years. Picasso had moved to Paris in 1904; by the 1930s, he was already recognized as a master of twentieth-century art. In this monumental, almost sculptural portrait, Man Ray presented the artist as a working man whose gargantuan hands attest to his manual labors.
Man Ray made a series of nude figure studies to accompany Surrealist Paul Eluard's poems in the 1935 volumeFacile(Easy). Eluard's wife Nusch, who had posed for Man Ray on other occasions, served as the model and inspiration for the project. This particular image was not included in the final volume.
One of Man Ray's earliest portrait commissions in Paris came from the Marquise Luisa Casati, an eccentric Italian aristocrat who was an important patron of vanguard artists. Casati's audacious hair and makeup were part of the fantastical world she constructed, which included a taste for extravagant clothing, interior design, costume balls, and pets. Her masquerade costume here represents her as the Empress Elizabeth of Austria.During the 1920s, Man Ray photographed her at home in her salon, surrounded by her favorite objects, and used a drawing of another photographic portrait in a still life.
A close-up view of part of one end of an ostrich egg transforms the organic object into a lunar surface. Placing an adhesive stamp in the lower left corner, Man Ray effectively put his  artist's stamp  on the collage. By also signing his name on the print, Man Ray laid claim to both the image's authorship and to the deliberateness of this unlikely juxtaposition.
Taken from the fly's-eye view, this startling photograph of an ordinary insect challenges the viewer to expand his or her perception of the world. The insect's impressive monumentality lends it a significance not accorded in real life. Out of scale with the landscape, the fly assumes the role of an airplane, swooping up into the shadowed sky.
Published in the October 1934 issue ofHarper's Bazaar, this picture reveals Man Ray's prowess in combining the eye of the artist with the requirements of commercial work. Using a long, undulating line broken only by the dramatic flare of the hem, he graphically represented the elegance of the evening gown by French designer Augustabernard. The model's anonymity and the absence of background detail ensure complete concentration on the designer's creation.
In the 1930s Man Ray re-photographed many of the friends who had initially posed for him in the 1920s. In this portrait, the Surrealist painter Yves Tanguy appears as a mad genius with electrified hair and an unnerving gaze. The established art magazineCahiers du Artfrequently published Man Ray's portraits of his artist friends.
One of Man Ray's sunflower pictures appeared in a Surrealist journal as kind of  astounding object,  but here he used the picture in a different way.  Probably photographed during a summer visit to the French coast, this picture of a sunflower seems to radiate optimism for the new year. In fact, 1936 was a promising year for Man Ray, who purchased a vacation cottage in the south of France at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, became involved with Adrienne Fidelin, and showed work in two largeSurrealismexhibitions in London and New York.
Joan Mir, a painter from Barcelona, moved to Paris in 1919 and undoubtedly met Man Ray through mutual friends. This portrait lends a mysterious Jekyll-and-Hyde air to the unassuming painter, with half of his face appearing normal and the other half distorted by shadow. A rope loops behind his head, introducing an element of Surrealist menace and ambiguity into the picture and suggesting the mobile quality of line in Mir's own art.
Man Ray paid homage to the French photographic pioneer Joseph Nicphore Nipce with this print. The lavishness of this monument, erected near Gras, France, in 1933, probably appealed to Man Ray. By the early thirties Man Ray had created a significant body of photographic work and, through his revival of thephotogramprocess and the Sabattier effect, had linked himself with early practitioners of the medium like Nipce.
Man Ray dedicated this still life, made in his studio, to his friend and model Nusch Eluard. He wrote on the back in French:  In this little corner there are all sorts of toys and objects for passing the time when one is alone.  He may have presented the photograph to her while he was preparing to leave Paris and after her husband, poet Paul Eluard, was sent to the front line during World War II.
This portrait captures the beauty of the woman with whom Man Ray fell in love shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles. She became his wife and an important subject for him. Here Juliet Man Ray presents an elegant three-quarter view, swathed in a scarf crowned with a Brazilian headdress of straw and shells. A typed caption on the back of the picture suggests that it may have been intended for publication, possibly as a fashion image.
To create this double exposure, Man Ray turned the image of a clothesline full of laundry on its side and superimposed it over a photograph of a sculpture. The juxtaposition creates a sense of confusion and uncertain orientation, as the two separate images vie for position and scale in the dense composition.
From the almost invisible people at the left of the composition, the scale of this weather-beaten carcass Man Ray photographed on the beach in Malibu can be judged. This fascinating found object, looking like a stranded whale, is actually the hull of a ship washed ashore.
When Man Ray wrote to his niece around 1940 that  there was moreSurrealismrampant in Hollywood than all the Surrealists could invent in a lifetime,  he could probably have expanded those geographical borders to include this curious museum commemorating the Pony Express. Located about fifteen miles from Los Angeles in Arcadia, a town named for the ancient Greek district said to symbolize pastoral beauty, the oddity of this monument to a brief moment in American history must have appealed to Man Ray's appreciation of the absurd.The Pony Express mail service between Saint Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, lasted only eighteen months. It was a financial failure but gained its infamy from its most famous, colorful riders: William ( Buffalo Bill ) Cody and  Pony Bob  Haslam.
Born into an aristocratic Mexican family, Dolores del Rio came to the United States in 1925 to embark on an acting career. Man Ray must have made this portrait in traditional Tehuana garb prior to 1942, when Del Rio returned to Mexico to contribute to the development of film as an art form there.Besides this picture and some shots of Ava Gardner, scholars know of few other celebrity photographs from Man Ray's years in Hollywood.
Man Ray used a photograph of the Los Angeles Coliseum--the rows of seats are visible through the archway--as the background for a pen-and-ink sketch. Here he drew the sketch directly on the print; later he developed the study into the paintingL'homme infini(The Infinite Man) of 1942. His inscription in the lower left corner declares his presence in Hollywood.
I decided to get a car. It should be a new oneI did some window shopping. Then I saw my car, discreetly advertised. It was a low, closed body, four seater, completely streamlined without any excess chrome trimmings, the finish, metallic blue, the interior blue, my favorite color. I could see myself in it with my bright blue tweed jacket livening up the color.Thus Man Ray described his decision to succumb and purchase a car in Los Angeles. He did one better than visualize himself behind the wheel of his brand new Graham  Hollywood Supercharger --he photographed himself there. The angle of incline optimistically suggests that he not only had places to go but the vehicle in which to arrive.
The Weston Havens house in Berkeley is one of the finest achievements of modernist architect Harwell Hamilton Harris. Commissioned in 1939 for a hillside site facing the Golden Gate Bridge, the house had been recently completed when Man Ray drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco for the opening of his 1941 exhibition at the M. H. De Young Memorial Museum.Magazines widely reproduced Man Ray's photographs of both the exterior and the interior of this structure.
Inspired by Japanese design, architect Harwell Hamilton Harris conceived his structures to harmonize with nature. In this house, which displays his masterful use of redwood and glass, he wanted to associate the building not with the hillside below but with the sky.Scholars know of no other architectural studies by Man Ray. In this first commission, he also photographed the exterior of the house and created images sympathetic to Harris's aims.
Man Ray photographed this imposing redwood somewhere in northern California. He and Juliet made several trips to Big Sur to visit their friends the novelist Henry Miller and Margaret Nieman.
Created for the June 1943 cover of the New York journalView, this composition of disparate elements encourages the viewer to invent his own narrative. A foreboding quality, created with shadows,solarization, and the inexplicable juxtaposition of abandoned satin dance shoes and a broken chair under a gnarled tree stump, pervades the picture.
In this picture of his wife Juliet, described as having  faun-like features and slanted eyes,  Man Ray seems to have captured the ancient godPanin mid-frolic in the forest. The theatrical style of this image is a departure from Man Ray's figurative work of the 1920s and 1930s.Although many of his pictures of Juliet were formal studies focused on the beauty of her shape and features, many that he made in the 1940s in Los Angeles are somewhat narrative, perhaps due to the influence of Hollywood films. During his decade in California, he also emphasized dramatic lighting. He made this print using a filter that created a textured effect.
Remarkable for its starkness, this photograph of a brittle castor bean leaf appeared with four others by Man Ray in the October 1943 issue ofMinicam Photography. In his caption for the image, Man Ray wrote with uncharacteristic poignancy of the knowledge that  the dying leaf would be completely gone tomorrow.  It is tempting to interpret the melancholy sentiment of the work in terms of the artist's growing discontent concerning his lack of recognition and financial success in Los Angeles and his fear that the work he left behind in France might be destroyed during the war.
In New York in the 1910s, Man Ray made an photograph titledMoving Sculpture. In this collage he combined a print of that image with a photograph of one of his paintedpapier-mchmasks and shapes cut from a photograph of blinds. Animated and dimensional, the striped sections are arranged in an optically disturbing alternating pattern, their placement suggesting wings.
This image illustrated a story by Man Ray in the journalView,and it was later used as the basis for a segment of Hans Richter's 1948 filmDreams That Money Can Buy. Thefilm noiratmosphere of the photograph suggests the influence of Hollywood on Man Ray, who was living in Los Angeles when he made it. Interested in filmmaking but not in the collaborative process of studio-produced movies, Man Ray turned down offers to work as a cameraman.
Stripped to the waist, a masked Margaret Neiman hovers behind author Henry Miller, whose calm demeanor and shirt, suspenders, and tie provide an almost humorous contrast to his animated muse. Like Man Ray, Miller arrived in Los Angeles in 1940, where he took up residence with Neiman and her husband Gilbert, an artist and writer who introduced Man Ray and Miller. In printing the negative for this image, Man Ray rippled the photographic paper to distort the top of the composition.
Having dropped twine on the floor after opening a parcel, Man Ray was captivated by the design the rope formed. He photographed the arrangement to preserve it as a work of art. Decades later, in the 1960s, he reversed the process by gluing configurations of twine to a board, demonstrating his interest in returning to themes and exploring them in a variety of media. The title refers to the colloquial expression,  Give him enough rope to hang himself. 
In this self-portrait, made eight years after he arrived in Los Angeles, Man Ray presented himself in the traditional guise of the artist in his natural surroundings working at his craft. He stands at the enlarger holding a negative, while bits of other prints lie about, providing a rare glimpse of the behind-the-scenes construction of his art.
Juliet Browner met Man Ray in 1940, and they were married in 1946. She devoted herself to the role of his muse, and he photographed her hundreds of times over the course of their thirty-six years together. Of all Man Ray's models, Juliet was the most enduring and perhaps the most pliable. With a background in modeling and modern dance, she may also have inspired the somewhat more theatrical narrative he began to employ in his images.
This photograph pays direct homage to an image of a bather by the painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, one of Man Ray's favorite artists. Of all Man Ray's models and muses, his second wife Juliet was the most enduring and perhaps the most pliable. Many of his pictures of Juliet are formal studies in which the viewer's eyes are drawn to her figure and features. With a background in modeling and modern dance, Juliet inspired a more narrative approach in his work.
In this haunting portrait, Man Ray superimposed an image of mud over a portrait of his wife Juliet, with downcast eyes. In a startling way, the mud merges easily with her skin, transforming youthful beauty into a fragile piece of aged sculpture. Her melancholy expression contributes a sense of unease.
 After dinner we went to a night club where some of the best jazz of the period was being played. We danced. Juliet was like a feather in my arms  With these words Man Ray described his first meeting with Juliet Browner, a thirty-year-old dancer who had recently come to Los Angeles to make a career in the movies.In this deliberately out-of-focus image of Juliet dancing, her white skin and flowing dress catch the light in waves of movement. Through gesture and graphic strokes of light, Man Ray captured the sensuality and fluidity of movement--like a feather floating through the air.
After the German occupation of Paris, Man Ray moved to Los Angeles in 1940. In this Rayograph, made around the end of World War II, Man Ray constructed a barrage of toy fighter planes that tacitly suggest the victorious Allied army.
Man Ray photographed three masks in a close-up view that makes them appear almost human. The arrangement and cropping make the masks appear to cascade down like a bunch of grapes, curiously evoking references to decadence and besotted bacchanals. Masks often appear in Man Ray's photographs; he probably made these himself.
I hastened to the place on Vine Street, a four-story brick building . . . . going into the courtyard, I saw palm trees, ivy-covered walls, and hibiscus bushes in flower. . . . I couldn't imagine anything more perfect. Paying my first month's rent, I moved in as soon as possible.In his autobiography, Man Ray described with vivid detail finding the first apartment where he lived in Hollywood, during the time this image was made. The lush foliage of Los Angeles reminded Man Ray of the south of France, yet this image reveals no sentimentality or sun-induced reverie in nature. Photographed close-up, the intimate details of the flower's structure challenge the viewer's assumptions about the commonplace.
Man Ray made this self-portrait in Los Angeles in the 1940s, suggesting his longing for the Paris of the 1920s, the capital of art and fashion. He originally decided to go to France to find artistic freedom and kindred spirits. Artists and intellectuals had frequently been his sitters; here, assuming the fashionable trappings of the artist, Man Ray re-positioned himself in that illustrious company.
Unlike most of Man Ray's photographs of Juliet Man Ray, which emphasize her beauty, this picture of her is intentionally unflattering. Its degrading quality harks back to the Surrealist treatment of the female figure. After the couple's return to Paris in 1951, Juliet became Man Ray's primary photographic subject. He continued to take pictures of her nearly up to the time of his death.
This portrait's bold brushwork, stark contrasts of light and dark, and frank presentation of the sitter reflect Manet's early passion for seventeenth-century Spanish painting. Madame Brunet, the wife of a friend, rejected the painting on account of its perceived ugliness however, and the artist retained it in his studio. He eventually cut off the bottom portion of the canvas, reducing it to a three-quarter-length portrait, and displayed it in his one-man exhibition in Paris in 1867--a show of independence opposite the World's Fair, where more polished examples of society portraiture, like James Tissot'sPortrait of the Marquise de Miramon(also in the Museum's collection), could be seen.
 One of the most beautiful, strangest, and terrible spectacles one could see is a bullfight,  wrote douard Manet to his friend the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire in 1865. Fascinated by bullfights, Manet here chose to illustrate the violent moment of a bull goring a horse with its horn. While the horse is pinned against the arena, thetorero,dressed in red and still clutching his cape, escapes by jumping over the barrier. Thepicadoror   horse-master  is caught helplessly between his mount and the wall while two spectators try to lift him to safety.Manet probably made this drawing at the scene of an actual bullfight. He used an energetic and gestural line to define the forms for the bodies of the bull and horse. Thin lines of black watercolor delineate the figures, and applied shades of color give three-dimensional form. Touches of yellow, red, blue, and brown animate the crowd of spectators, while economically applied black paint suggests details such as facial features.
To commemorate the recent Exposition Universelle, itself a celebration of luxury and prosperity, the French government declared June 30, 1878, a national holiday. The holiday, called theFte de la Paix(Celebration of Peace), also marked France's recovery from the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 and the bloody, divisive Paris Commune that followed. From his second-floor window, douard Manet captured the holiday afternoon with his most precise, staccato brushwork in a patriotic harmony of the reds, whites, and blues of the French flag that waves from the new buildings' windows.The urban street was a principal subject of Impressionist and Modernist painting; many artists aimed to show not only the transformation and growth of the Industrial Age but how it also affected society. Manet's eyes saw both elegant passengers in hansom cabs and, in the foreground, a worker carrying a ladder. The hunched amputee on crutches, perhaps a war veteran or beggar, passes by fenced-in debris left from the construction of a new train track. Manet's sensitivity to the associated costs and sacrifices tempered his optimistic view of national pride and newfound prosperity.
An ancient Roman religious rite inspired this clock, designed in the Neoclassical style after a drawing by Hubert Robert that was published as an engraving between 1771 and 1773. Two bronze priestesses of the temple of Vesta, the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth and its fire, carry the altar bearing the sacred flame. The sacred flame and the vigilance of the maidens, who kept the altar fire burning continuously, came to symbolize eternity, a suitable association for a timepiece. The theme extends to the hour and minute hands, which are in the form of a snake, another symbol of eternity.The French craftsmen added fine chasing to emphasize decorative details on the pedestal altar, the delicate ritual vessels, and the arabesque patterns on the altar cloth surrounding the clock face. Panels representing Art and Science flank a frieze with cherubs and a goat. Four lounging lions and a marble plinth support the clock. Pierre-Philippe Thomire designed a number of examples of this piece, two of which belonged to Queen Marie-Antoinette.
Andrea Mantegna made this drawing as a preparatory study for the left side panel of an altarpiece, still in the church of San Zeno in Verona, which he painted between 1456 and 1459. Although the drawing is highly finished, it was evidently made at an early stage of the design, since Mantegna subsequently changed the saints' positions. From left to right, the four saints are Peter, Paul, John the Evangelist, and Zeno. Saint Zeno, the patron and titular saint of Verona, wears a mitre, a bishop's liturgical headgear.
Two male figures stand in a relaxed, classical contrapposto pose, with each one's body weight resting on one leg. The figure on the left steadies a large shield decorated with a Medusa-like head and looks to the side, apparently gazing at the book being read by his companion.Scholars are uncertain about the identity of these figures. Andrea Mantegna may have made the studies in preparation for an altarpiece in Verona or for his partly destroyed frescoes in the Ovetari Chapel in Padua. On the verso, he added a reclining male nude and a man with an uplifted arm among the inscriptions-possibly Mantegna's own exercises in penmanship.
Three kings pay homage to the Christ Child, who in turn makes a sign of blessing. Jesus Christ, his mother the Virgin Mary, and Mary's husband Joseph have haloes and wear simple garments, while the Magi are dressed in exotic clothing and jewels and bear exquisite gifts. Caspar, bearded and bareheaded, presents the Christ Child with a rare Chinese cup, made of delicate porcelain and filled with gold coins. Melchior, the younger, bearded king behind Caspar, holds a Turkish censer for perfuming the air with incense; on the right, Balthasar the Moor carries a covered cup made of agate.Andrea Mantegna's composition of figures and objects compressed within a shallow space was based on his study of ancient Roman reliefs. He used a neutral background and sharply defined details to focus the viewer's attention on the kings' adoration of Christ.
To emphasize the frenzied violence of the mocking of Christ, Niklaus Manuel Deutsch devised a dynamic radial composition with Christ's luminous, haloed head as the focal point of attacks from all sides. He also included a framing line, to which he wittily called attention by extending the soldier's foot outside its bounds at the bottom.Northern European artists frequently made drawings on colored grounds to be sold to collectors as independent works of art. Manuel Deutsch and such contemporaries as Albrecht Drer and Albrecht Aldorfer employed the technique of drawing on a deeply colored ground with white strokes delineating contours or modeling figures. Ordinarily, they used a sharp quill pen and a fine pointed brush, which they handled with such control that the thinness of its strokes could rival or outstrip those of the pen.For this drawing, the artist prepared a red-brown ground, then drew the scene in black ink. Next he brushed in the lavish whiteheightening, refined additional details in black ink, and touched in Christ's halo with gold pigment.
The stylized clothing of this serene, seated cardinal creates a dramatic pyramidal form. An unbroken conical sweep, the cardinal's vestment or robe extends from his feet to his mask-like face. Covering his forehead, his headdress, known as a miter, functions as the  tip  of the pyramid. The folds in the vestment emphasize the bronze's weight and volume but also create tension and dynamism, enlivening the form. A tiny hand emerges from beneath the garments to remind us that there is a body beneath this powerful bronze cladding. But body and vestment form an indissoluble whole.In the early 1930s, Giacomo Manz visited Rome, where the sight of the Pope flanked by two cardinals in St Peter's Basilica struck him as a singularly timeless image. From the late 1930s to the late 1950s, the sculptor produced more than fifty cardinals--standing and seated, large and small, in bronze, alabastar, and marble. Over this long series, Manz increasingly contained the cardinal figure in rigid compact forms that evoked funerary pyramids or pillars. With only one exception, the cardinals were all conceived without a model, their features invented entirely by the artist.
A man's jacket slung over one shoulder, the cuffs of her shirt cut off with scissors, the Bohemian poet and performer Patti Smith levels her gaze outward with authority and calm. The set of her jaw and lift of her chin suggest she wears confrontation lightly. Simultaneously, a waifish delicacy haunts her tiny body. She touches the ribbon around her neck with long fingers cupped near her heart --a shy gesture and nod to the garb of the 19th-century Romantic poets she admires. With quiet ferocity, the portrait hovers between masculine and feminine, strength and vulnerability.Intimately bonded in life and work, Mapplethorpe and Smith made this image for the cover of her debut rock album,Horses.It is one of his earliest celebrity portraits, a genre in which he went on to distinguish himself. He often amplified the glamour of his subjects, but modernized conventional portrayals with provocative depictions of race, gender, and sexuality. For example, record executives, concerned that Smith with her lack of makeup and messy hair wasn't conventionally pretty enough to sell records like other  girl singers,  wanted to airbrush this image. Knowing Mapplethorpe would back her up, Smith refused and the image and album shaped the start of both their iconoclastic careers.
I don't want to leave too much to chance.--Robert MapplethorpeThe ruffled silhouette of this bouquet of tulips contrasts with the geometric shapes of black, white and grey around it. Mapplethorpe carefully arranges these elements so that a traditional subject, the floral still life, becomes, quite literally, edgy. The composition is disconcerting, as a viewer is uncertain how the vase can balance on the corner of the table, or how exactly the planes of the foreground and background are angled. The resulting image is at once lovely and vaguely unsettling.Mapplethorpe's diverse body of work also included fashion, nudes, portraits, and erotic and sadomasochistic subjects, and is distinguished by an elegant, classical sensibility with an undercurrent of darker complexity.
I don't want to be labeled anything.-- Robert MapplethorpeDespite his elaborate pompadour and face so attractive as to be almost pretty, the artist's stare in this self-portrait is forceful and direct.Mapplethorpe's sophisticated use of lighting gives the outlines of his mouth, nostrils, and earlobes a refined, even sculptural quality. The same elements of glamour and striking simplicity for which he is known in his celebrity and fashion portraiture are visible here, including a tightly cropped composition and uncluttered background that further dramatize the face. Mapplethorpe drew on his early commercial work for magazines, includingVogue. This aspect of his career followed the examples of other noted photographers such as Edward Steichen, Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, and Herb Ritts.His work encompassed portraits, nudes, and still lifes, often with strong erotic, homosexual, and sadomasochistic themes.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, his work provoked an American culture war over whether public funds should support art some deemed blasphemous and obscene.
The model Ken Moody poses face front, eyes closed, centered in a simple composition characteristic of the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's clean aesthetic. His perfectly hairless head, face, and body, the result of alopecia universalis, appear to take on a sculptural weight and dimension. The dark shadows of the background seem to lap at his neck, shoulders and under his arms, as if he emerges from a timeless, dark sea. The sophisticated lighting also sculpts the curves of his face, collarbone, and chest to further heighten their elegant forms.This figure study is part of a large body of work featuring African-American men. Mapplethorpe was absorbed by the texture and color of their skin, which he referred to as bronze. He used Agfa's Portriga 118 paper for its ability to produce the velvety texture and glow discernible in this reproduction. His strong, uncluttered compositions of statuesque male models fused a classical sensibility with homoerotic content at a time when the male nude was not a popular subject among camera artists.
Perfection means you don't question anything about the photograph. There are certain pictures I've taken in which you really can't move that leaf or that hand.--Robert MapplethorpeMapplethorpe presents a tulip, a staple subject of still lifes for centuries, but approaches it in a distinctive way. By choosing to capture the flower in profile, rather than from what would be the intuitive, vertical sightline, Mapplethorpe imbues the image with a sense of motion. The arc of the stem bows below two outstretched leaves, as if floating up or down on wings.After his beginnings with Polaroid portraits, Mapplethorpe refined his style and process in the early 1980s. Drawing on his knowledge of the 19th-century photographs he collected, he used simple compositions and careful lighting to great effect. Considered a central figure in late 20th century photography, his subjects span elegant figure studies, delicate floral still lifes, glamorous celebrity portraits, and the S&M; community.
My whole point is to transcend the subject...go beyond the subject somehow, so that the composition, the lighting, all around, reaches a certain point of perfection.--Robert MapplethorpeMapplethorpe's work, whether in his fashion or fine art photography, is distinguished by a tension between opposites. At the base of this image of a calla lily, he punctuates the wide planes of black and white with what seems a decadent surprise: the three-dimensional, curving lip of the flower's edge. He explores the effects of light as a painter might experiment with a palette of colors. At the top, the flower glows milky white, reminiscent of light seen through delicate alabaster or porcelain.Mapplethorpe's spare compositions often showcase familiar subjects in unusual ways. Floral still lifes, for example, have long encouraged sexual interpretations, and especially here, given the artist's other work with erotic and sadomasochistic subjects. His imagination transformed and energized what some had considered a stale genre.
Floating on a throne of clouds, the figures Justice and Faith look down on three putti who hold up an empty scroll. One of the virtues, Justice, sits on the left, holding the scales in one hand as a symbol of her impartiality. Between her knees lies a fasces, a bundle of wooden rods enclosing an ax, used by ancient Roman magistrates as an emblem. On the right sits Faith, with light shining from her head. Holding the key to the church in one hand and a crosier and model of a church in the other, she wears a papal tiara to protect her from the attack of heretics.Carlo Maratti made the drawing as a preparatory study, in reverse, for the upper left corner of a large map of Rome. When it was published in 1676, the scroll held by the putti contained a dedication to the newly elected Pope Innocent XI.
In this depiction of the ancient city's remains, Philippos Margaritis, a native-born Greek, and Philibert Perraud, a Frenchman, photographed the Arch ofHadrianat Athens, a masterpiece ofclassicalarchitecture. The Arch, built around 131 A.D., is a light, elegant structure, with an opening flanked by freestanding columns and a colonnaded upper story. Barely visible beyond the Arch at upper right is the distant mount of the Acropolis.
This side wing and its companion were once part of an altarpiece commissioned in 1408 by the confraternity of the Virgin and Saint Stephen for the church of Santo Stefano in Pane, outside Florence. The central panel, now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, shows the Coronation of the Virgin.In the Getty Museum's panel, Saint Lawrence, with his name inscribed beneath, faces the viewer. He is also identified by his attribute, partially seen behind him, the gridiron on which he was martyred. Saint Stephen, identified by an inscription beneath, turns to the right to witness the coronation in the central panel. In a roundel above, an angel crosses its arms in veneration.

It is difficult to identify Lillie, dressed in baggy clothes and dragging on a cigarette butt, as a thirteen-year-old girl; only the rag doll cradled in her arm belies her age. Mary Ellen Mark's inclusion of the doll implies lost innocence--especially juxtaposed against a graffiti wall with the word  dope,  a reference to drugs, clearly visible.This photograph is part of a photo essay entitledStreetwise. In 1983Lifemagazine sent Mark to Seattle to document the phenomenon of adolescents who left family and home in favor of life on the street. Sleeping in abandoned buildings and scavenging for food in dumpsters, these street children survived by begging, stealing, and hustling; the girls often turned to prostitution. Mark's photo essay resulted in the 1988 book,Streetwise. The project also relates to a film of the same title, on which she collaborated with her husband, Martin Bell.
Tiny was thirteen when she and Mary Ellen Mark first met. Impressed by her ease in front of the camera, Mark developed a friendship with her, and continued to photograph her over the years. Here, Tiny wears a Halloween costume that she pieced together to look like a French prostitute. She nonchalantly blows a bubble with her chewing gum while gazing directly into the lens. As a girl, Tiny dreamed about horses, yachts, diamonds, and jewels. Twenty years later, she was the mother of nine children.This photograph is part of a photo essay entitledStreetwise.

A youth's victory in a musical contest decorates the interior of thisred-figurecup. He stands crowned with a myrtle wreath, holding his kithara, whileNike, the goddess of victory, flies in, ready to award him a fillet or ribbon. A different sort of contest, a chariot race, covers the outside of the cup. This is no ordinary chariot race, however, for the drivers are women and three horses are harnessed to each chariot. Although the drivers are not named, their gender and the three-horse team set the action in the mythological realm.A mythological subject is further suggested by the brands of the horses. One horse has a kerykeion, or herald's staff, on its flank; the other has an X-shaped mark. While real Greek horses were frequently branded, the mark of the kerykeion appears predominantly in representations of mythological contexts. Given these clues, both drivers probably represent Nike. In the late 400s B.C., vase-painters would sometimes depict more than onepersonificationin a scene in order to amplify the message.
The Visions of the Knight Tondaltells the story of a wealthy and errant Irish knight, whose soul goes on a journey through Hell and Paradise with an angel for a guide. As a result of his experience, Tondal is spiritually transformed and vows to lead a more pious life.BeforeDante'sDivine Comedy, the story of Tondal was one of the most popular in a long tradition of visionary and moralizing literature. Originally written in Latin in the 1100s by Marcus, an Irishmonkin Regensburg, the story was later translated into fifteenvernacularlanguages.The Getty Museum'smanuscriptofTondal,written byDavidAubert, was written in French (Les Visions du chevalier Tondal). It was commissioned byMargaret of York, duchess of Burgundy and wife ofCharles the Bold. She was one of the most famouspatronsof manuscriptilluminatorsin a region that outshone even its rival, the kingdom of France, in its prolific patronage. Theilluminationis attributed to the French artist Simon Marmion. The Museum's manuscript is the only surviving illuminated copy of the text. In its twentyminiaturesMarmion represented an extraordinary world of Paradise and Hell in vivid, often terrifying, but alwaysnaturalistic, detail.
The Vision of the Soul of Guy de Thurnois a French translation of a Latin text that discusses Church doctrine on purgatory (in French, the title isLa Vision de l'ame de Guy de Thurno). Guy de Thurno was a wealthy citizen of Verona who died and then returned to earth in spirit form to haunt his widowed spouse. She turns to a local priest for help, and a dialogue between the priest and the ghost on the nature of the afterlife results.A singleilluminationby the renowned Flemish artist Simon Marmion decorates this copy of the text. It shows the priest and the widow, along with four other men, grouped around an empty central space occupied by Guy's ghost. The bystanders look uneasy as the priest actively debates with the unseen spirit. Themanuscriptwas commissioned byMargaret of York, duchess of Burgundy, as a companion piece to her illuminatedVisions of the Knight Tondal, also in the Getty collection, which concerns heaven and hell.
The narrator ofThe Visions of the Knight Tondalbegan his cautionary tale with a prologue:Lord Tondal was young of age and of a very noble house...But he had one thing about him, which I cannot mention without sadness, that he was so confident in his youth, in his good looks, and in his strength, that to the salvation of his soul he never gave a thought....Theminiatureat the top of the page represents the first pivotal moment in the story, when Tondal becomes ill at a banquet. The artist, Simon Marmion, set the scene in an upper-class dining hall with a long table, many hovering attendants, and richly attired guests. In the center, Tondal, with his right arm  extended toward a platter of food to help himself,  clutches his left hand to his chest. About to collapse, he tells the group that he has had a vision that he is about to dieIn this scene, Marmion focused on the descriptive details of a familiar domestic setting and painted the scene with bright, lyrical tones. In contrast, the Hell scenes that follow are more inventive and painted in vivid colors with sharp contrasts.
Tondal fell dead...without any further movement of foot or hand. All the signs of a dead man manifested themselves on him: his eyes rolled, his nose was pinched, his lips grew thin, his chin receded, and his arms and legs grew stiff.Drawing on vivid details from the text describing Tondal's appearance, the artist represented him in a dead faint on the floor. Around him hover the stunned onlookers; two women clasp their hands and bow toward him in grief. According to the story, because Tondal's body was still warm, he was not buried. Meanwhile, in his comatose state, Tondal's soul saw  an awful and horrifying multitude of devils who soon invaded the house as well as the air all over the city.  The devils are represented as almost translucent figures penned in gold on the darkness above the onlookers' heads. This marks the beginning of Tondal's vision, in which an angel leads his soul through Hell, allowing him only a glimpse of the rewards of Paradise. Like Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens'sA Christmas Carol, Tondal will lead a better life upon his return.
After Tondal fell unconscious to the floor, he refused to leave his body for fear of the terrible demons waiting to take his soul. According to the text, a beautiful angel descended to offer comfort. The angel promised to take Tondal's soul on a journey, beginning with hell, and ordered him to remember all he will learn. In theminiature, the demons hover over the heads of Tondal's worried friends in the interval before his angelic guide appears.
The angel first shows Tondal's soul the torment reserved for murderers. Those who have killed people are repeatedly burned, roasted, then liquefied and strained into a cauldron of burning coals. Theilluminatorhere depicted the murderers falling into the pot of boiling liquid.
The angel leads Tondal's soul to a narrow pass at the foot of a mountain where demons torment unbelievers and heretics. The fiends first cast the sinners into great stinking fires of sulphur on one side of the pass. On the other side, the fiends haul the sinners out with red-hot hooks and drag them into abysses of cold, jagged ice. As the narrator describes the torture,  From bad to worse, the souls were treated without hope of ever leaving. 
The angel leads Tondal's soul across a narrow bridge,  in width barely one foot  and  much more than a thousand feet in length.  Tondal's soul hears the piteous moans of souls of  the proud, the ungrateful, and the presumptuous  from below as they tumble into the deep valley.
In thisminiature, Tondal's wandering soul observes the punishments meted out in Hell to the greedy. Theilluminatorhas envisioned the entrance to Hell as the mouth of the beastAcheron, whose name derives from Greek mythology, referring to the river inHadesor Hell. This creature rolls its horrid eyes, its mouth gaping threateningly wide; two devils impaled on its sharp teeth hold its mouth open. Inside, souls endure brutal torment in a fiery furnace. Flames from this hot pit, represented with wispy brushstrokes of blue, red, orange, yellow, and green, lap about the edges of the beast's upper lip. The artist, Simon Marmion, represented Tondal's soul as a naked and vulnerable figure. In the Middle Ages, souls were commonly represented as nude human figures, expressing the idea that the trappings of the material world are shed in death. Except for the angel's blue robe, which is brightened with gold flecks and lines, Marmion saturated this scene with the dark, vivid colors he reserved for Hell.
In the part of hell reserved for thieves, Tondal must lead a cow over a narrow bridge in penance for once having stolen a cow from a friend. At the midpoint of the bridge, which is only as wide as his hand and studded with sharp iron nails, Tondal encounters another sinner carrying sheaves of wheat. Miraculously, Tondal and the man pass each other and make it across, completing their penance without falling into the pit of demons below.
Traveling through darkness, the angel and the soul of Tondal arrive at an oven-shaped building as tall as a mountain. As fire spews forth from an opening in this structure, devils skewer all who come within reach, dismembering them and casting them into the fire. Again the soul of Tondal is told that if he does not change his ways, he will suffer for his sins. He hears the crying and moaning of innumerable souls who are racked by insatiable hunger and whose genitals are rotten with worms. As in the rest of the story, the punishment meted out to the gluttons and fornicators in this portion of hell is cleverly tailored to the individual sins. The artist used color to distinguish the calm radiance of the angel, in a blue gown with gold highlights, from the demon executioners, who are barely distinguishable from their dark and fiery world.
The angel points out to Tondal's soul the beast that tortures unchaste priests and nuns. After the beast devours the souls, he excretes them, dropping them onto a frozen pond. Once on the ice, the souls regain their bodily forms but now both women and men are made pregnant. As multiple creatures grow inside them, they eat the sinners' entrails. The sinners eventually give birth to hideous serpents, which emerge from all parts of their bodies. This torment is reserved not only for nuns and priests but for all men and women who are guilty of the sin of lust. As punishment for his lustful life, Tondal's soul goes through one cycle of this torment before the angel rescues him and they continue their journey.
In the Valley of Fire, demons seize Tondal's soul and throw it into a blazing forge. Here demons cook sinners' souls and then pound them into a fierymasswith anvils. As before, the angel rescues Tondal's soul after much torment and asks him if the  delights and pleasures of the flesh  he enjoyed on earth were worth the punishment delivered in hell. Tondal, however, is so weak he cannot utter a word.
The angel takes Tondal's soul to the Cistern of Hell, where demons cook sinners' souls in a pit filled with a foul-smelling whirlwind of flame. To the despair of Tondal's soul, demons drag him into the pit and threaten to take him to their prince,Lucifer. Suddenly, however, the angel once again comes to Tondal's aid, driving the demons away and comforting him.
The angel takes Tondal's soul to the gate of Hell. Amidst a crowd of demons, the greatLucifersqueezes writhing souls in his ten thousand hands as if they were in a winepress. He then tosses the crushed souls into the flames around him. Tondal's soul recognizes many of his friends and family members suffering in this infernal region.
After visiting the depths of Hell, the angel leads Tondal's soul to Heaven, where he comes upon people standing in niches in a very high wall. Although they are exposed to the wind and rain, the souls are not tormented in any other way. These people, the angel explains,  did not commit great evil,  but neither did they share their worldly goods generously with the poor.  To set up a contrast with the dark, fiery images of Hell, a cool luminescence pervades the scenes of Heaven.
In Heaven, the angel next shows Tondal's soul a gate through which he can see the souls of those who were good but not very good. These souls sit by a fountain in a lush, green field blooming with sweet-smelling flowers and beautiful trees, but they are denied the privilege of being in the company of the saints.
The angel and Tondal's soul come upon two Irish kings, Donatus and Conchober, who have recently died. Although they were great enemies, these kings made peace between themselves and repented, earning their places in heaven.
The angel and Tondal's soul soon come to the place in Heavenpreparedfor the faithfully married. Before a handsome wall of solid silver, an assembly of saints sing praises to God. Not only do the beautiful saints sing a sweet melody, but the air is heavy with perfumes and spices.
After leaving the faithfully married, Tondal's soul and the angel come upon a wall made of gold, reserved for martyrs and those  who crucified their flesh against the vices and lusts of the world.  Sitting upon sumptuous thrones of gold and silk, richly dressed men and women sing  Alleluia.  Each wears a crown, a sign of victory over sin.
Once in paradise, the angel and the soul of Tondal come to a place filled with silken tents and pavilions, from which music emanates. Although Tondal is allowed to look inside, he is forbidden to enter. This place is reserved formonksandnunswho lived their lives in complete obedience and chastity and now share the company of angels and dwell in the presence of theHoly Trinity. The artist chose to give the viewer only a partial glimpse into one of the pavilions. The souls of the good monks and nuns, resembling angels and playing musical instruments, are visible but the elaborate decorations described in the text are not revealed. Instead, the slightly raised curtain and the concealed interior hint at the privileged nature of the place. In thisminiatureset in Paradise, the artist employedpastelblue, green, and pink tones, creating a strong contrast with the dark scenes of Hell.
In this lastminiaturein themanuscript, the angel brings Tondal's soul to a beautiful wall in heaven, designed to give consolation and joy to the most deserving. The wall, according to the author  shimmered as if aflame [with] crystal, jasper, chrysolite, hyacinth, sapphire, emerald, onyx, topaz, sardonyx, chrysoprase, amethyst, and garnet.  Tondal's soul is so inspired by the sight that he asks the angel if he can stay forever. The angel explains that he must return to his body and bids him to heed the lessons learned from the sights he has seen.At the conclusion of his mystical journey, Tondal's soul is reunited with his body. Awakening from his illness, Tondal promptly asks for Communion and  donate[s] all his worldly good to the poor and order[s] the sign of the Cross put upon all his garments. 
One day, kneeling before a statue of the Virgin, Saint Bernard (1090-1153) prayed,  Show yourself to be a mother.  In response, a few drops of milk from the breast of the statue, a metaphor for the gift of life, fell onto Bernard's lips. Thisminiature, removed from a devotional book at some point in the past, illustrates that legend. Bernard's words, in Latin, are inscribed in gold above the Virgin's head. The statue of the Virgin and Child seems to come to life before Bernard, a feeling enhanced by the artist's depiction of theChristchild reaching out and grasping Bernard's staff. In addition, the miniature is structured so that the viewer looks over Bernard's shoulder and sees the scene from hisperspective. The overall effect is to bring the viewer as close as possible to Saint Bernard's own experience of the miracle.
The top of this small table folds open, revealing a circular scene of three women dressed in exotic costumes and taking tea under the pulled-back curtains of a tent. A monkey and a parrot perch in the branches of trees blossoming in thebackground. Themarquetrytea scene and the table's sturdy tripod form suggest this table was used to support a tea or coffee tray.Veneered with pewter and brass, the table's major decorative elements are of tortoiseshell; this form of decoration is known ascontre partie.The table was probably made for theGrand Dauphin, the oldest son of Louis XIV, King of France. It prominently displays five fleurs-de-lis, theheraldiclily from the royal arms of France, and four dolphins, symbol of the Dauphin. At this date royalemblemsappeared only on royal gifts or on objects made for members of the royal family.
Gaspard Marsy's bronze of Boreas Abducting Orithyia entwines three figures in a complex and compact spiral: a small reclining Zephyr, the young but powerful Boreas, whose puffed-out cheeks refer to his identity as the North Wind, and the struggling Orithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens. According to Greek mythology, Boreas brought Orithyia to Thrace, where the two reigned as King and Queen of the Winds.To decorate the corners of Charles LeBrun's never-completed garden at Versailles, the Parterre d'Eau, Louis XIV commissioned four monumental marble groups representing mythological abductions, each featuring three figures and symbolizing one of the four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. This bronze, with Boreas as a personification of the North Wind representing Air, is based on Marsy's preparatory model for one of these statues. Since the garden was never built as planned, Louis XIV commissioned bronze reductions, or smaller scale copies, of Marsy's work and Franois Girardon's statue to form a pair for his Salon Ovale in the palace of Versailles. The Getty Museum's collection includes two casts of both of these works, in two different sizes.
The Panathenaia, a state religious festival, honoredAthena, the patron goddess of Athens. Held every four years, the festival included athletic, musical, and other competitions. Amphorae filled with oil pressed from olives from the sacred trees of Athena were given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. These amphorae had a special form with narrow neck and foot and a standard fashion of decoration. One side showed Athena, the goddess of war, armed and striding forth between columns, and included the inscription  from the games at Athens.  The other side showed the event for which the vase was a prize. Leading vase-painters, commissioned by the state, decorated these vessels, which continued to be decorated in theblack-figure techniquelong after it had gone out of fashion for other vases, probably due to religious conservatism. The same conservatism is applied to the depiction of Athena.On this example, the figure of Athena is portrayed in anArchaisticor old-fashioned style. An additional inscription, seen here to the right of Athena, names the archon or city magistrate. Because historical records date these magistrates, the vase can be dated very precisely. The event side of this vase shows a special race in which anapobatesor armed competitor had to leap off a moving chariot, run along side it, and then jump back on.
This cabinet was one of a pair delivered in 1788 for the bedroom of Louis XVI at the chteau of Saint-Cloud. From a memoir written in the same year giving a detailed description of both cabinets, scholars know that both were originally veneered with panels of Japanese lacquer cut from a screen. The document lists in detail not only the names of most of the artisans who worked on the cabinet, but also the cost of each part--an unusual and fascinating detail. From this document, researchers learned that the most expensive part of this piece was the elaborately chased and gilded mounts, which show symbols of the king.At some point in the early 1800s, someone replaced the lacquer panels withpietre dure(hardstone) plaques. The companion piece, now in the Royal Palace in Madrid, has been changed too; marquetry panels showing harbor scenes replaced the original lacquer.The mounts were cast by tienne-Jean Forestier and Denis Bardin. They were chased by Pierre-Philippe Thomire and gilt by Claude Galle.
To the left sits a female figure with a celestial globe represents Astronomy, while on the right, Geography holds a loosely rolled map. Both figures are well modeled and must have been made by an accomplished sculptor. As is often the case with objects made entirely of bronze, the clock is not signed. A drawing of this work still survives, signed by the bronze caster tienne Martincourt. At the time of theFrench Revolution, this clock stood on the mantel ofLouis XVI'sSalonde Conseil(Council Room) at the Tuileries Palace.Charles Le Roy, whose name appears on the dial and the movement of the clock, died in 1771. As two springs are dated 1772, however, the clock was obviously completed after his death. The movement must have been finished by Le Roy's son tienne-Augustin, who signed his father's name, following the accepted practice of the time.
In his bookDirections to Servants,written in 1745, Jonathan Swift advised,Avoid burning daylight, and to save your master's candles never bring them up till half an hour after it be dark, although they are called for ever so often. . . . There is nothing wherin the skill of a butler more appears than in the management of candles.Candles, along with firelight, were the only sources of illumination after dark in the 1700s. Candlesticks made from bronze, silver, pewter, or wood, with one or two branches, were the most popular mobile light source. These candlesticks, with their crisp fluting andchasing, are engraved underneath with the nametienne   Martincourt, one of the main suppliers of bronzes to the duchesse de Mazarin.
Saint Luke, one of the four evangelists and thepatron saintof painters, is shown in the act of writing hisGospel. Hisattribute, a winged ox in the lower left-hand corner, holds a black inkpot for his pen. A decorative punchmarkedhalo, made by lightly tapping metalpunchesonto a goldbackgroundwith a hammer, surrounds the saint's head.TheSaint Lukepanel was probably one section of a five-part, portablepolyptych. The panels were attached to one another by leather straps and could be folded up and carried. The back and sides of the Saint Luke panel were painted to resembleporphyry. When the polyptych was folded up, it resembled a stack of purple stone tablets.Simone Martini was famous for his graceful, refinedcompositions. A gentle sweep of line defines the saint's body from his neck down to his elongated left hand.
An eighteenth-century clock such as this one was a collaborative effort of numerous craftsmen. The clockmaker, in this case the king's own clockmaker Julien Le Roy, produced only the movement. Le Roy would have commissioned a sculptor to design the elaborate model, a bronze caster to produce the bronze case, and a gilder to chase and gild it. The enamel clock dial was then painted and fired separately by a specialized enameler, Antoine-Nicolas Martinire.
This monumental corner cupboard follows a drawing by the French architect and ornament designer Nicolas Pineau, who was an early exponent of the Rococo style. The cupboard's large scale and exuberant gilt-bronze mounts reflect Eastern European rather than French taste. The cabinet was actually made for a Polish general, Count Jan Klemens Branicki. An inventory of Count Branicki's possessions made at his death describes both the corner cupboard and the objects displayed on its shelves: a collection of mounted Chinese porcelain and clocks, some embellished with porcelain flowers.The drawing of the corner cupboard, or more probably an engraving of it, must have caught Branicki's attention. Dubois was commissioned through a Warsaw dealer to construct the cabinet for the Polish aristocrat. Drawings and engravings were sources frequently used by foreign patrons and craftsmen to order and copy the latest fashions in French interior design.
At least three specialized craftsmen collaborated to produce this elaborate gilt bronze wall clock. The clockmaker Julien Le Roy, who signed the clock face and the movement, made the interior movement mechanisms. The bronze caster Jacques Caffieri cast and gilded the ornate case, which would have been the most costly part to produce. In this rare example, he engraved his signature on a cartouche below the dial. Antoine-Nicolas Martinire, the enameler, painted the numbers on the clock face and fired the whole dial. He inscribed the back of it with his name and the date1747.A detailed inventory of Jacques Caffieri's workshop made in 1747 describes a clock similar to this one, decorated with the figures of Minerva andCupidholding a scythe. Minerva, thepatronof learning and the arts, wears a helmet and armor and perches on a cloud on the top of the dial. The winged figure of Cupid, probably once holding a scythe in his hand, symbolizes Love conquering Time.
Charles Marville photographed this snow-covered area along the River Seine while it was being used as a building depot. Piles of paving stones for new roads line the water's edge, and larger blocks lie near the ramp that leads upward to the top of the embankment. This early image reflects Marville's interest in documentary photography, which became his specialty after the city of Paris commissioned him to photograph the roads scheduled for demolition byNapoleon III'sarchitect and city planner, Georges-Eugne, Baron Haussman.
The lower walls along this narrow street are covered with posters, despite the signs prohibiting them, while painted advertisements fill the overhead spaces. Shortly after Charles Marville made this photograph the street would disappear entirely, demolished as part of Baron Haussmann's restructuring of Paris's principal boulevards. A larger, straighter street that ran from one end of a bridge across the River Seine through this old neighborhood to the new central produce market, les Halles, replaced this passageway.
This dead-end, cobblestone lane stood near the horse market in Paris. Urban planner Baron Georges-Eugne Haussmann commissioned Charles Marville to document  old Paris  prior to Haussmann's redesign of the city's streets and public spaces. Beyond the stone wall, a quaint neighborhood of modest structures backs up on a dirt alley. Theforegroundtrees, stripped by the winter of their foliage, arch across the photograph like rolled up theater curtains revealing some backstage scene. This neighborhood may have been demolished to make way for one of Haussman's grand boulevards, which have come to characterize modern Paris.
The twin arches connecting one side of an old market to a parallel street are pasted with advertisements and playbills. This neighborhood was slated for demolition, according to the plans of Baron Haussmann, who oversaw the restructuring of Paris's principal boulevards and streets. Because this block would soon undergo destruction, it became a subject for Charles Marville's documentation of the changes wrought by urban renewal.
This atmospheric view of a wide Paris street, taken shortly after a rainfall, is one of four hundred such images created by Charles Marville in 1865. At that time, Napolon III's architect and city planner, Baron Haussmann, was planning a broad program of civic improvements in Paris that would extensively alter the layout of the city's boulevards and streets. Before demolition began, city officials commissioned Marville to create photographic records of the existing avenues. New roads cut through ancient neighborhoods, while streets such as the rue de Bourdonnais were realigned and widened.
Although Charles Marville began his photography career concentrating on religious sites and architecture, his attention soon turned to civic subjects, such as this monumental public space extending out from the Arc de Triomphe. When creating this image, Marville's intent was not to simply document a specific place or structure, but to illustrate the national glorification of France. On the left side of the image, relief sculptures looking over the vast space around the arch celebrate Napolon Bonaparte's victorious military campaigns.
Saint Andrew is identified by his attributes of a cross and a book. The cross refers to his martyrdom by crucifixion. TheSaint Andrewpanel was originally part of the upper right tier of a largealtarpiececommissioned by a wealthy public officer for a church in Pisa. St. Andrew's haunting gaze in this painting is turned toward Christ on the cross, shown in the altarpiece's upper middle panel. Other panels of the fifteen-foot-tall altarpiece are in museums throughout Europe.The modulation of light and shadow in Saint Andrew's robe gives the illusion of physical weight and solidity to the figure underneath. Masaccio was famous for his innovative depiction of three-dimensional forms in painting and his ability to portray figures with convincing physical and emotional presence.
The most famous historical record of Europe in the 1300s, the monumentalChroniclewas written in French(Chroniques)by Jean Froissart and recounts the major political and military events from around 1322 to 1410. Focusing on the rivalry between England and France, theChronicleis a basic resource for the study of theHundred Years' War. Froissart also described the affairs of other realms, though largely as they related to the complex network of overlapping and shifting alliances around England and France.The Getty Museum'smanuscriptcontains the third of four books; its 730 pages cover only the period from 1358 to 1389, an indication of the level of detail Froissart sought to impart. The Museum's volume, from about 1480, shows the lasting esteem that theChronicleenjoyed: new copies of the text were still being made about seventy years after the author's death. The book was made inFlanders, perhaps in Bruges. The choice of subjects for the sixty-fourminiaturesstrongly emphasizes events involving the English, evidence perhaps that the book was produced for the English market. Indeed,King Edward IV, who built the first royal library in England, may have commissioned it.
This large-scale, splendidly illuminated choir book was designed to be seen from the lectern by a group of singers during the Divine Office, the eight prayer services celebrated daily by monks, nuns, and clerics of the Catholic Church. It is the first volume of an antiphonal that probably consisted of seven separately bound books. The manuscript's illumination primarily takes the form of historiated initials marking each of the major holidays of the church year. The illuminator of this manuscript, known as the Master of Gerona, worked in Italy in the late 1200s. Familiar with the most recent trends in Italian panel painting and Byzantine icon painting, he knew how to convey a sense of weight, volume, and depth. Drawing on these innovations, he embedded scenes of surprising naturalism within the initials.
TheHon the left side of the page introduces the chantHodie nobis celorum rex(This day unto us the king of heaven), the first elaborate chant for the predawn service on Christmas. The representation of the Nativity within the enlarged initial heralds the theme of the chant, the celebration of Jesus' birth.The Virgin Mary, depicted in a traditional reclining pose, and Saint Joseph, seated to the right, seem lost in contemplation of the swaddled Christ Child in a sarcophagus-like crib, a reference to his future sacrifice. Jesus directs his gaze above, where the star followed by the Magi appears as a comet whose tail leads back to the baby. Apocryphal texts described the rocky, cavelike setting and stable animals whose heads appear behind the manger. The massive, draped figures and the relatively deep, three-dimensional space are characteristic of contemporary Byzantine art.
This initialCopens the prayers for Saint Nicholas's day on December 6th. The legend of Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century bishop, relates the story of the saint rescuing the daughters of an anguished father from prostitution by offering the father money for their dowries.The initial provides a keyhole-like view of a house. Through its windows, the reader sees a man weeping on the lower floor, his two daughters upstairs, and the saint to the right, proffering the necessary gold. Although the legend mentions three daughters, the artist only included two daughters and two gold balls. Saint Nicholas's story became an important theme in art of the late 1200s because the rising costs of dowries in Italy developed into such a burden that contributing to young girls' dowries became a common act of Christian charity.
The subject of the historiated initialS, which accompanies one of the chants for the Feast of the Holy Innocents, is the event known as the Massacre of the Innocents. Herod, the king of the Jews at the time of Jesus' birth, became jealous when a prophecy foretold that a child born in Bethlehem would usurp him.In the initial, Herod sits at the left, giving the order for the massacre of all male children under the age of two. To the right, a soldier prepares to kill another helpless victim, seemingly oblivious to the cries of the child he holds callously by the leg. Herod's light pink garb and the soldier's delicately decorated tunic and armor, with elegant linear designs, dots, scrolls, and sprays of leaves, form a jarring contrast to the blood-stained sword and the pitiful heap of infant heads and corpses.
A historiated initialAwith Christ in Majesty, the first and largest illumination in this antiphonal from Bologna, accompanies a chant for the pre-dawn prayer service for the first Sunday in Advent, the season of preparation for Christmas. In the chant the singer describes how he  sees the coming power of the Lord,  referring to Christ's return at the end of time, when he will sit in judgment of all humanity. From the roundel at the lower left, the prophet Isaiah, whose words provided the inspiration for the text of the chant,  sees  Christ. The illuminator has depicted Jesus as a massive, authoritative figure in voluminous draperies, sitting frontally on an ivory throne and attended by a group of winged angels. The book he holds, the Book of Life mentioned in the Apocalypse in the New Testament, contains a list of the saved and the damned.
Around the tendrils of theSthat opens the chant sung on his feast day, Saint Stephen kneels in prayer while his tormentors hurl stones at him from behind. Stephen, who lived at the time of Jesus, was the first martyr to sacrifice his or her life in the name of Christianity. This illumination closely follows the biblical story--showing that Stephen's devotion continued through prayers that he recited during his torment.To heighten the impact of the drama, the illuminator depicted the stones both in the hands of the attackers and actually striking Stephen's body. The saint's face, however, betrays no fear, so sure is he of Jesus' saving power. In the upper segment of the letterS,Saul, who later converted and became Saint Paul, crouches on the discarded robes of the false witnesses who testified against Stephen. Despite the scene's violence, the artist takes delight in the elegant pivot of the first tormentor, the decorative scrolls on the letter and on the saint's gown, and in the tooling--small decorative dots punched in the gold leaf--of Stephen's halo.
This profusely illuminatedFlemishbook of hoursoffers an unusual reversal of what is expected. While borders are customarily visually subordinate tominiatures, the lush foliage in the borders of thismanuscript'smost outstanding pages captures the reader's attention and gives unity to the double-page spreads.Theilluminationsare the work of several artists, the most talented of whom is known as the Master of Guillebert de Mets. His miniatures are painted on single leaves, which were inserted into the manuscript. This fact suggests that he did not work in close collaboration with the scribes who produced the text. The style of his paintings reveals that the artist had abackgroundin the ParisianInternational style, yet his bold handling of borders with their rich vegetation and energetically twisting banderoles is unique.
According to legend, Saint Veronica wiped the face of Christ with her veil (orsudarium) as he carried the cross to Calvary, and the veil retained an imprint of Jesus' likeness. This holy relic was revered as a true likeness of Christ and became a popular devotional image that artists reproduced in various media.This miniature introduces a prayer on the opposing page to the Holy Face of Christ (Salve sancta facies), which was written around 1300 and is often incorporated into books of hours. The popularity of this prayer testifies to the growing interest in the later Middle Ages in Christ's suffering during his Passion.
Theilluminatorplayfully linked border andminiaturein this image accompanying a prayer to Saint George. In the miniature, the mounted knight, Saint George, rescues a princess from a dragon. In the border, her parents, a pagan king and queen, watch from a castle tower on the sidelines, almost crowded off the page by enormous stalks of foliage. According to legend, the people of the kingdom converted toChristianityfollowing their deliverance from the dragon's attacks.The dramatic and exuberant acanthus border provides a fitting counterpart to the elegant miniature featuring the equestrian hero and the princess. The brightly colored sinuous foliage echoes Saint George's flowing, elaborately scalloped cape, further uniting the framed miniature and the border.
TheHours of the Virgin, the core service in thebook of hours, opens with adevotional imageof Mary that draws together the many varied aspects for which she is celebrated. Seated on the ground with theChristChild, she represents theMadonna of Humility. The large gold mandorla and the blue cherubim that surround her display her asQueen of Heaven. She is also depicted as the description of the enigmatic Woman of the Apocalypse:  Robed with the sun, beneath her feet the moon, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Interestingly, the Christ Child and angels play musical instruments, recalling the melodious chanting of psalms in the Hours of the Virgin and the inaudible music believed in the Middle Ages to emanate from the heavenly bodies.
ThePenitential Psalms, a compilation of seven psalms united by the common theme of repentance, are introduced by a most distinctive two-page opening in thisFlemishbook of hours: a full-pageminiatureof the Last Judgment paired with a smaller miniature of KingDavidin prayer.Christsits on a double rainbow surrounded by Mary,Saint John the Baptist, acardinal, a pope, two bishops, and a pair of trumpet blowing angels. Below, the twelve apostles look up while praying as the dead rise from their graves. The saved emerge from a tent in the border at the left, while the damned peer helplessly out of a tiny mouth of hell in the border at the right. The image of Christ seated in judgment provided a meditational focus for the recitation of the psalms, urging sinners to repent before death.
The theme ofDavidin prayer often introduces thePenitential Psalmsinbooks of hours. Not only was David traditionally identified as the author of the psalms, but he served as a model for penitence. After his adultery with Bathsheba, he was rebuked by theprophetNathan and repented. Here he appears on his knees, speaking directly from his heart to the Lord.The repetition of the colors of green, blue, and gold, the depiction of large lilies in the borders, and the inclusion of a banderole issuing from theminiatureinto the border foliage matches the decorative scheme of the preceding image of the Last Judgment, producing a harmonious double-page opening.
With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.
Most books of hours open with a calendar of the succession of church holidays, listing saints' days and other feast days in black and singling out the most important in red. The Spinola Hours' calendar pages are particularly lavish, combining a frieze in monochrome, scenes in roundels, a landscape featuring an activity associated with the month, called the Labor of the Month, at the bottom, and a zodiacal sign.The calendar is the only part of a book of hours decorated primarily with secular scenes. On the bottom of this page, for the month of February, a peasant carries a bundle of sticks in an expansive landscape while others plow the vineyard, all bundled up to ward off the winter cold. In the frieze at the top, children play various games. The roundels on the right accompany the most important feasts (listed in red in the calendar): the uppermost scene depicts the Presentation in the Temple; below, clerics crown Peter as pope to illustrate the feast of Saint Peter's Chair; next is a portrait of Matthew the Apostle. Within the arched frame on the bottom, two fish represent the zodiacal sign Pisces; the title is painted as if engraved on the frame.
The Master ofJames IV of Scotlandvisualized the complex Christian doctrine of the Trinity as three crowned figures seated on a throne that hovers in a glowing heavenly light. Each of the three figures is distinct from the waist up but they share one robe, signifying the Christian belief that the Trinity consists of three persons and one substance. In the ethereal space around the throne, transparent angels singsanctus(Holy). During Church services in the hymn of adoration,sanctusis sung three times, once for each person of the Trinity.The artist delighted in plays ofillusionism. The image's painted frame resembles a carved wooden frame of analtarpiece, suggesting an analogy between an altarpiece and the book. Three lines of text are written on an illusionistically painted slip ofparchment,  pinned  to the page of the book to make it appear like a separate piece of parchment. Arubricin red identifies the following text as the prayer forMatinsof theHours of the Holy Trinity, to be read on Sunday. The text, in black ink, begins with a line fromPsalm50:Dominelabia mea aperies(Lord, open my lips).
The miniature of theOld Testamentstory of Abraham and the Three Angels forms a pair with theHoly Trinityminiature across the double-page spread. Christian commentators understood the story of Abraham's encounter with the three angels as an Old Testament prefiguration of the Christian Trinity. The artist underscored this interpretation by giving the three angels similar facial features and just one halo. At the bottom of the miniature, Abraham, kneeling in prayer, greets his heavenly visitors. Latin words written in gold come from his mouth:Ingredere benedicte d[omi]ne mi(come in, the Lord who has blessed me). Above, Abraham serves his guests whileSaraheavesdrops behind a curtain on the right. Her weathered face betrays her age, emphasizing the miraculous nature of her conception ofIsaac, which the three angels had come to prophesy. On the upper left, Abraham leads the angels on their way.Like the facing page, this page includes a frame painted to resemble analtarpieceand a block of text written on a piece of parchment illusionistically painted to look as if it is pinned to the page. Here the text ofPsalm50 continues from the previous page:Et os meum annuntiabit laudem tuam(and my mouth will declare your praise).
A series of wonderfully vivid images tells the Biblical parable of Lazarus and the rich man. Splendidly dressed in furs and jewels that indicate his great wealth, the rich man, called Dives, sits at a table crowded with dishes. His double chin and girth are clear signs of his over-indulgent habits. The artist cleverly constructed theminiatureto show simultaneously the interior and the exterior of the house. Outside the frame, Lazarus approaches the house to beg for some scraps from the rich man's table. Dives refuses the humble request, while his dogs race to lick the sores on Lazarus's pathetic body. Below, Lazarus has died from hunger and exposure, but two angels greet his soul and enfold it in a white cloth. The facing image finishes the story.
These images complete the story of the poor beggar Lazarus and the rich man Dives, begun on the previous page. Underneath the text, Dives suffers torment inHadesafter his death as the consequence of his uncharitable lifestyle. Horrifying demons approach to sink their teeth and claws into him as he lifts up his eyes and sees the soul of Lazarus tenderly greeted in heaven above. Dives cries out and asks for mercy in the words recorded in red on a white scroll. The reply, written in gold on a blue scroll reads:Son, remember that during your life you received good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things. Now, however, he is being comforted and you are in agony(Luke 16:25). By transposing the positions of Lazarus and Dives on the facing pages, the Master ofJames IV of Scotlandgraphically depicted the changes in fortune referred to on the scroll. On the previous page, Dives occupies the center of thecomposition, enjoying his life on earth with the pitiful body of Lazarus below. On this page, Lazarus has the central place, being welcomed into heaven while Dives suffers for eternity below.
TheVirgin Mary, crowned asqueen of heaven, sits below a canopy that bears the inscription in Latin,  Hail queen, merciful virgin.  She holds a chubby-cheekedChristchild, who reaches back to grab her long, flowing hair. A group of elegantly dressed saints, at left, and a group of angels, at right, adore the child. Theilluminatorhas placed the scene within anillusionisticframe that resembles the carved wooden frames of late medievalaltarpieces. It harmonizes with the frame of theminiatureshowing the Tree of Jesse on the facing page. The text, the opening of a prayer service in honor of the Virgin, appears as if on a hinged panel in front of the scene.
At the bottom of the page, theOld Testamentfigure Jesse, dressed in sumptuous garments, reclines on a bed. A tree trunk grows out of him, its branches filling theminiature. Old Testament kings, most wearing crowns and carrying scepters, occupy the branches. KingDavidis distinguished from the others by his harp. The tree culminates in a flower holding the Virgin and Child within a golden aureole. The image is a visualization of a prophecy ofIsaiah:  And there will come forth a shoot out of the root of Jesse, and a flower will grow out of his root.  Medieval Christians interpreted this enigmatic passage as a foretelling thatChrist, the flower, would be born of theVirgin Mary, the shoot, who was descended from the Jewish patriarch Jesse, the father of King David.As on the facing page, a few lines of text are included on anillusionistichinged panel, which gives the impression that it could swing open to reveal more of the scene behind it.
The Master ofJames IV of Scotlandplayed with the relationship between text and image in hisminiatureof theAssumption of the Virgin. In mostbooks of hours, the framed image is clearly separated from the text. But here the text, enclosed within a frame, has become part of the illusion created by the painter. In addition, the scene's rocky landscape flows unimpeded on all sides, undermining the purpose of the frame. The artist depicted a sequence of events in the landscape: on the left, the funeral procession of the Virgin; at the bottom, her open grave; and in the center, her glorious Assumption into heaven. The artist drew from various popular legends to enrich the story. According to legend, the apostles were miraculously brought to her deathbed from all over the world. Here, led by John holding a palm branch, they carry the Virgin's coffin. In the center panel, the Virgin's belt, or girdle, is given to the doubting apostle, Thomas. The text accompanying these scenes from the end of the Virgin's life belongs appropriately enough to the service ofCompline, the last service of the day in theHours of the Virgin.
The artist Gerard Horenbout structured thisilluminationof theCrucifixionto complement visually and thematically theminiatureof theAssumption of the Virginon the facing page. Thenarrativeof the Crucifixion unfolds in a dramatic landscape, with the main image a view of the hilltop that serves as the Crucifixion's setting. A procession of soldiers and Roman officials leaving the hilltop fills much of the page and continues into the border, where the city of Jerusalem can be seen in the distance on the far right. The subsequent scene of the Lamentation appears at the right, followed by theEntombmentenclosed in the space beneath the text panel.Theilluminatorevoked the scene's religious significance principally through the use of dramatic lighting. The brilliant colors of the sun at the upper left and on the far right will soon be extinguished by the approachingmassof dark clouds, reminding the viewer of Saint Matthew'sGospel, which reports an eclipse of the sun at the time of Jesus' death.
Thisminiatureillustrates theOffice for the Dead, one of the essential texts of abook of hours. Said over the body of the deceased the night before a burial, the office was also read daily as a reminder of one's mortality, reflecting the need for constant penitence. In atour-de-forcedisplay ofillusionism, the artist used the distinct compartments of frame and border to show contiguous indoor and outdoor scenes. In the lower border Death, represented as a gruesome corpse, hunts a man in a park-like landscape. Above, the victim lies on his deathbed while clerics read the Office for the Dead. The artist linked the two scenes by suggesting that the interior we see in the miniature is an enlarged, cut-away view of the house depicted in the border. In addition, an elusive figure with a red hat on the far left unites the hunting scene with the deathbed scene. This man appears twice, first leaving the hunt, walking away from the viewer down a hillside, and then passing into the house from its entryway on the left.
Across from theminiaturedepicting the last rites and prayers at the deathbed, thisilluminationshows the Office of the Dead. In a small, private chapel adorned withheraldicbanners, the deceased rests in a richly covered catafalque. Around him, hoodedmonkskneel during their devotions, members of the choir sing, and one monk passes out candles. Standing before the altar, the priest leads the service, the text of which appears on a panel illusionistically painted as if incorporated into the frame. Theilluminatorused the trompe l'oeil frame to separate spaces and to suggest simultaneous views of both the church's interior and its exterior and scenes above- and below-ground, including a subterranean chapel.
Facing the viewer, Christ raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing. In his left hand he holds stone tablets inscribed with a passage from John 14:6:Ego sum via veritas vita,  I am the way and the truth and the life.  This miniature was painted by an artist in the workshop of Jan van Eyck, one of the most influential painters of the northern Renaissance. Christ's facial type, the authority of the Lord's gaze, and the expressive breadth and weight of the mantel are particularly characteristic of van Eyck.Although Christ stands on a tiled floor that seems to recede, creating a shallow three-dimensional space, the background is composed of a flat, highly decorative checkered pattern.In the short prayer accompanying the image, the petitioner makes an unusually generous appeal to God to pardon his enemies. Below the text at the bottom of the page, two young men kneel before a lord. The prayer's message may have inspired the image, as the young men seem to lay down their arms and seek forgiveness.This page was removed from a famous medieval manuscript, the Turin-Milan Hours, which was begun for Jean, duke of Berry, and worked on sporadically over the course of the next fifty years by as many as ten artists.
Compiled at the end of the 1200s by Guiart des Moulins and subsequently expanded, theHistoricalBiblewas the most popular Bible in French of the Middle Ages (it is called theBible historialein French). It includes French translations of all the books of the Bible, a series of commentaries written in the 1100s by the scholar Peter Comestor and translated by Guiart from Latin into French, and additional commentaries and glosses authored by Guiart himself. This compilation is called theHistorical Biblebecause the commentaries stressed the role ofscriptureas a record of historical events. Thus, in most illuminated copies, the book ofGenesis, the first of the historical books of the Bible, is profusely illustrated, while non-historical books, like those of the prophets, receive only oneilluminationeach. The many extant copies of theHistorical Bibleattest to the desire of increasing numbers of lay people to have a complete Bible available in French.     More than seventyminiaturesillustrate the Getty Museum's two-volumeHistorical Bible,focusing largely on thenarrativeaspects of the texts. The Master of Jean de Mandeville, the anonymous master responsible for the majority of the illuminations, painted the costumes of his figures ingrisaille,a monochrome technique popular in Paris in the 1300s. The contrasting brightly patterned backgrounds underscore the three-dimensionality of the delicately drawn, palely colored figures.
TheHistoricalBibleopens with thefrontispieceofChristin Majesty, with the Four Evangelists writing their Gospels in the corners. Even though Jesus' story is not told until later in the biblicalnarrative, his representation here links theOld Testamentcreationstory opening the Bible with Christ's future birth, emphasizing that each individual biblical narrative can be seen as part of the progression of Christian history.Theminiaturefeatures graceful figures wearing sinuous draperies painted ingrisaille. This technique, popular in the 1300s, is characterized by the use of variations of a single color to suggest a sculptural quality. The figures appear before colorful decorative backgrounds of red or blue, with the whole framed by an elaborate quatrefoil structure.
And the Lord God sent [Adam] out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken . . .  and placed before the paradise of pleasure cherubim, and a flaming sword, turning every way.(Genesis3:24)Dressed in rough clothing,Adam and Eveare driven from the garden of Eden by an angel who menacingly raises a sword. The artist transferred the flames mentioned in the text from the sword to Eden itself: a wall of fire extends the length of the garden, effectively destroying any hope of reentry. The decorative redbackgroundof theminiaturepicks up the color of the flames, emphasizing the tone of anger evident in the story.
Kneeling before a pink altar, Cain andAbeloffer the fruits of their labor in sacrifice to God: a sheaf of wheat from Cain and a lamb from Abel. The repetition of the figure of God in the arc of heaven above allows the artist to show that God was pleased with Abel's sacrifice and dissatisfied with Cain's. From the left, God smiles down diagonally on Abel at the right. The figure of God to the right covers his face in displeasure as the bearded Cain at the left vainly looks up for approval. Jealousy over God's preference for Abel led Cain to kill him, committing the Bible's first murder.
Theminiatureprefacing theGenesisstory of the birth of Isaac's twin sons Esau and Jacob depicts the episode as if it were occurring in the 1300s. Rebecca, wearing a noblewoman's wimple, reclines in a fourteenth-century-style bed after giving birth. As she twists beneath thegrisaillebedsheets, the carefully rendered draperies reveal the shape of her body. Against a brightly patterned ground, the midwives prepare the newborn infants for their bath. The women's gestures suggest that they are conversing with one another, lending liveliness to the scene.In the biblical text, Esau is described as particularly hairy at birth, a detail theilluminatorchose not to include. Neither did the illuminator raise the theme of rivalry that would dominate the brothers' relationship.
Because of its dramatic historicalnarratives, moreilluminationsaccompany the book ofGenesisthan any other portion of theHistoricalBible. Thisminiaturefrom the Genesis cycle of illuminations features Jacob's most beloved son,Joseph. Thrown into a well by his jealous brothers, Joseph cowers, naked and vulnerable. Later, his brothers will sell him to the Ishmaelites and drop his robe into the blood of a goat to convince their father that a wild beast has killed him. On the left side of the image, two of Joseph's brothers are slaughtering the necessary goat.Theilluminatorworked in a courtly style, creating figures that move with ease and grace against the richly patterned ground.
King David, believed during the Middle Ages to be the author of the Psalms, introduces the opening of the Book of Psalms in theHistoricalBible. He appears holding a harp, the stringed instrument often associated with the Psalms, while a psaltery and a rebec, other medieval stringed instruments, are pictured nearby. Part of David's traditional association with musical instruments derives from anarrativein the Book of Kings, in which the priest Samuel calls upon the young David to sootheKing Saulwith beautiful songs.Daily, both clergy and lay people read portions of the Book of Psalms, one of the most popular books of the Bible.
KingDavidpoints to his eye as he addresses the Lord, pictured within a pink cloud above. Because medieval readers would have understood a direct connection between light and the sense of sight, this gesture illustrates the opening words of the text in red just below theminiature,  The Lord is my light and my salvation  (Psalm26:1). The anonymousilluminator, known as the Master of Jean de Mandeville, concentrated the viewer's attention on the exchange between David and the Lord by isolating the figures in front of a delicately patternedbackground. Because medieval Christians believed David to be the author of the psalms, they found it particularly appropriate that he should be shown acting out the psalm's text.
The fool says in his heart 'There is no God.'(Psalm52)In aminiatureprefacing Psalm 52, theilluminatorrepresents the poem's imagery literally. The  fool  of the text appears here as the lunatic figure familiar during the Middle Ages: shoeless, wearing rags, and carrying a club. He holds an unidentifiable object, perhaps a stone, to his mouth; from this he can draw no nourishment, a visual analogy to the denial of God's existence.In the medieval period, lunacy was seen as a punishment inflicted by the devil. In the upper right corner of the miniature, a small demon crouches before the swirling gold decorative patterns, either the cause of the fool's lunacy or, perhaps, the agent inspiring the fool's denial.
This elaborate frontispiece to the second volume of theHistorical Bibleaccompanies the Book of Proverbs, traditionally ascribed to King Solomon. The four scenes show events from the life of Solomon, each of which emphasizes his wisdom. In the upper left, he teaches his son Rehoboam, who kneels before him with a book. The next two scenes tell the story of the Judgment of Solomon. Two women come to Solomon carrying a dead baby and a living one, each claiming the living child as her own. When Solomon orders a soldier to cut the baby in two and give half to each, one woman gives up her claim rather than see the child killed. Solomon recognizes her as the true mother and returns the baby to her.In the last scene, three men claim to be a dead man's only true son. Solomon states that the legal heir will be able to shoot an arrow into the heart of the father's corpse, knowing that the real son will refuse. Solomon's judgments made him a perfect model of wise kingship for the nobles who would have seen this manuscript.
Simon de Varie, who served in the French royal treasury under Charles VII and whom the king had recently raised to noble rank, commissioned a book of hours, which was completed in 1455. This richly illuminated private prayer book includes a calendar of church holidays and texts for devotional services inspired by the eight daily services of the divine office. The rise in literacy among the merchant and noble classes and their desire to express a newly emotional personal piety, particularly in veneration of the Virgin Mary, spurred the popularity of books of hours in the 1400s. In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.
In this miniature depicting the Flight into Egypt, the Virgin, baby Jesus, Joseph, and a female attendant escape to Egypt to elude Herod's soldiers, who search for Jesus to kill him. The artist squeezes the figures into the foreground, while a deep vista unfolds behind them. The long path winding back in space conveys a suggestion of their long journey. In the border, the illuminator included a figure cutting wheat and a soldier, referring to the Miracle of the Wheat Field, an apocryphal story about the soldiers' unsuccessful search for Jesus.This miniature in Simon de Varie's book of hours accompanies the Vespers text of the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers devoted to the Virgin Mary. It begins with the second verse of Psalm 69,Deus in adiutorium meu[m] intende(God, come to my assistance). A cycle of miniatures featuring images drawn from the New Testament and sacred legend traditionally illustrates the Hours of the Virgin.An anonymous artist known as the Master of Jean Rolin II painted the miniature. He used a light palette characterized by an abundant use of white, as seen in the figures' clothing and the foliage in the border.
A clawed and horned devil tugs at the robe of Saint Bernard, trying to drive the saint to evil thoughts. The dispute between the devil and the saint revolved around the Verses of Saint Bernard; the devil claimed to know seven psalm verses that would ensure salvation when recited every day but said that he would not reveal their identity to Bernard. On hearing this, the saint informed the devil that he would henceforth recite all the psalms every day in order to be sure to say the seven particular verses. The devil was so frightened at the thought of such a display of piety that he immediately revealed the identity of the verses. The image, part of a letterI, introduces the seven verses in Simon de Varie's book of hours. Unrelated to the psalm verses are the images in the border, which include two hybrid, part-snail creatures, each perched on a tuft of grass.
Primary colors surrounding the clear glass faces of theMadonna and Childdraw attention to their emotional expressions. As she holds him close, Mary looks at theChristchild tenderly, but with a knowing sadness. Christ turns toward his mother and lovingly touches her chin. These mortal traits are combined with the evidence of their divinity indicated by golden halos.This panel was originally located in a dark, medieval church, where its simple design of a few colors and sinuous lines boldly conveyed the figures from a distance. The window's visual impact would have varied according to the amount of light passing through it--depending upon the season, weather, and time of day. The window's position high up in a church wall allowed radiant, colorful light to filter through the church, creating a kaleidoscopic effect. This panel was located in theCistercianAbbeyof Klosterneuburg, near Vienna, Austria, one of the most important repositories of medieval art in Europe.
Immediately after theCrucifixion, Jesus' followers take his body down from the cross. Two men on ladders lower the body whileJoseph of Arimathea, in his fur-trimmed robe, sways under the weight. The sumptuously dressed Mary Magdalene holds a ladder, while the more modestly dressed Virgin collapses on the ground with grief. At the foot of the cross, a skull identifies the site as the Mount of Golgotha. This moving image of theDepositionis attributed to the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, an anonymousilluminatorwho collaborated on thisprayer bookforCharles the Bold. In the border, amidst lush vines,Adam and Evemourn over the dead body ofAbelon the lower left in anOld Testamentepisode, considered aprefigurationof the Virgin mourning over Jesus' body. The lion in the upper left may refer toJesusas theLion of Judah; it may also refer to theResurrection, because, according to medieval legend, lion cubs were born dead but revived three days later when their father breathed into their faces. Conceived as a thematic whole, theminiatureand border herald the service ofVespersin theHours of the Passion.
TheVirgin Mary, hieratic and still, looks out toward the viewer while gently supportingChristwith her left arm. The smiling infant gazes lovingly toward her and playfully stretches out his arm, grabbing the edge of her gold-trimmed, blue cloak. The star over the Madonna's forehead refers to her title  Star of the Sea,  the meaning of the Jewish form of her name, Miriam.The Virgin's rigid and formal pose reflects theicontradition of theByzantineEmpire. The painting's format and the ornamental scroll on either side of the Madonna, also find close parallels in Byzantine icons. But unlike Byzantine work, the Master of Saint Cecilia emphasizes the intimate connection between theMadonna and Child, embodied at the Virgin's breast where her right hand gently cradles Christ's tiny left hand. This humanizing tendency would become increasingly prominent in Western Europe and a hallmark ofRenaissanceimagery of the Madonna and Child.
These two miniatures representingSaint Anthony Abbotand theCrucifixionare painted on single leaves of parchment that have been cut along the contours of the miniatures. Perhaps intended to function as a pair of independent images, they may have formed a diptych, a small altarpiece in two parts, in a monastery or hospital in Cologne dedicated to Saint Anthony. Alternatively, they may have once been part of a manuscript, perhaps for this same hospital or monastery.The leaves are the work of the Master of Saint Veronica, one of the most important artists working in Cologne around the year 1400. Throughout the Middle Ages, the city of Cologne on the lower Rhine River was a major artistic center. Cologne's proximity to Dutch and Flemish towns placed it within a nexus of burgeoning artistic creativity, especially in painting and manuscript illumination. The tall, mannered proportions of the figures, the brilliant colors, and the sweet-sad expressions reveal the artist's familiarity with earlier developments of the International style at the royal courts of Paris and Prague.
Jesushangs on the cross, his attenuated arms stretched far apart. He looks down at his grieving mother, whose flowing draperies emphasize her swooning posture. By depicting him with an elongated torso, uncomfortably crossed legs, and an elegantly drooping head, the artist emphasized Jesus' human suffering and frailty. The Roman soldier at the right recognizes the divine nature ofChristand turns to the Pharisee at his side. According to theBible, he says,  Indeed, this was the Son of God.  These words were intended to fill the empty speech scroll above his head.The gold geometric pattern of thebackground, the richly colored robes, and the elaborateGothicarches framing theminiatureall contribute to the scene's elegance. Theilluminator, the Master ofSaint Veronica, painted with richly saturated bright colors and linear arabesques, creating figures with tall proportions dressed in sumptuous courtly attire. The style he employed, known as theInternational style, was closely associated with the courts of Paris and Prague.
On a pedestal beneath Gothic arches, Saint Anthony stands like a living statue, blessing the people and animals gathered around him. On the right, several men carrying crutches have come to be healed, while a menagerie of animals in front looks up to Anthony as if listening to his words.Saint Anthony, a hermit of the 300s, renounced his worldly goods and retired to the desert of northern Egypt. In the 1100s, the Order of Knights Hospitallers, an organization that cared for the sick across Europe, adopted him as its patron saint. Although Saint Anthony was a desert hermit, he appears here wearing the black cape with the tau cross on the left shoulder worn by the Hospitallers of the 1400s. Growing out of his association with the Hospitallers, Anthony was called on to prevent and cure disease in both people and animals, which explains the assortment of followers around him.The miniature was painted by the anonymous artist known as the Master of Saint Veronica in the International style, which is characterized by bright jewel-like colors, detailed elaborate costumes, linearity, and melancholic expressions. The animals' naturalism demonstrates the artist's interest in the careful observation of nature.
Mostbooks of hours, privateprayer booksspecifically designed for lay people, contain a calendar, theHours of the Virgin, a standard series of readings from the Gospels, theOffice for the Dead, thePenitential Psalms, prayers, and hymns. This particular book of hours contains all those texts. Remarkably, it also includes other texts, both biblical passages and special prayers, focused on thePassion of Christ. The book'silluminationfeatures a number ofminiaturesshowing scenes from Jesus' Passion.Not only were books of hours important in the spiritual lives of their owners, but the most beautifully and extensively illuminated ones were important luxury objects. This one was illuminated by two anonymous artists, the most accomplished of whom is known as the Spitz Master. The two artists all painted in theInternational style, characterized by the courtly elegance of the figures and richly patterned fabrics rendered in brilliant colors and gold. Some of this book's miniatures were adapted from illuminations made by theLimbourg BrothersforJean, duc de Berry, the most famous artpatronof the age.
This richly illuminated book of hours is a small-scale prayer book made in either Rouen, France or England for an English patron. In addition to scenes from the life of Christ, this book is filled with lively images of saints popular at the time in England and France. The artist depicted important events from the life and death of each holy man or woman, often setting the scenes within lush landscapes. These images would have reminded those who read the accompanying suffrages, or prayers to saints, of the exemplary lives led by these individuals.The illuminator of this manuscript, known as the Master of Sir John Fastolf, trained in the Parisian workshop of the Boucicaut Master. He later moved to Normandy, and by 1450 he was working in England. This artist's international career reflects the movement of illuminators between major artistic centers in Europe, such as Paris, Milan, and Prague, especially around the year 1400. The manuscript displays artists' interest at this time in naturalistic depictions of landscape, patterned backgrounds, and elaborate border decoration, here composed of colorful acanthus leaves and gold ivy.
In this dynamic scene, the archangel Saint Michael tramples a black, winged beast and spears it with a lance. In the Book of Revelation, Michael is described as leading a battle in heaven against the devil, represented here by the defeated dragon. This popular military saint, shown dressed in armor, was widely revered in the Middle Ages as the weigher of souls at the Last Judgment and for his power to rescue individuals from hell.
Saint Denis, the first bishop of Paris, was beheaded in that city in the year 250. According to legend, angels accompanied him as he carried his own head from the place of execution to his chosen burial site, where later the church of Saint Denis was built just outside of Paris. Dressed in his bishop's garments, the saint is depicted with two haloes--one behind his decapitated head and a second behind the stump of his neck. This feature reflects medieval notions about the incorruptibility of saintly remains--the body does not decompose after death.By including two haloes, the artist emphasizes Saint Denis's presence in each part of his body and the sanctity of his physical remains.
Saint Francis of Assisi kneels in prayer at the center of a lush green landscape representing Mount La Verna in Umbria, Italy where he prayed and fasted for forty days. During a moment of intense prayer, a crucified seraph, or six-winged angel, appeared to Francis and imprinted the stigmata--Christ's Crucifixion wounds) on the saint's body, shown here by the red lines that connect the seraph's wounds to Francis's hands, feet, and side. The saint embodies the attempts by late medieval Christians to spiritually imitate Christ using private prayer books, like this one, to focus their meditations on Jesus's life, teachings, and suffering.
The young Virgin Mary holds an open book as her mother, Saint Anne, guides her reading. Saint Anne's teaching of her daughter is described inThe Golden Legend, a collection of popular stories about the saints. This image also reflects the use of books of hours, such as this one, as primers for children. The glittering gold, blue, red, and green checkerboard pattern that fills the background of the scene was a typical decorative motif in manuscript illumination around the year 1400.
In this closely trimmed historiated initialSfrom a gradual, the illuminator represented Saul's dramatic conversion to Christianity. Dressed in a soldier's helmet and armor, Saul tumbles to earth, his horse collapsing beneath him. Though the artist omitted the rest of the biblical account, in which Saul changes his name to Paul and takes up an evangelical Christian mission, the initial's viewers would have been familiar with the story. In the top half of the initial, another soldier, seated erect on a more elaborately liveried steed, wears a fancy hat and tunic trimmed in green, white, and red, the colors of both the Gonzaga and Este families. Given his visual precedence in the image, this man may have been the book's patron, commissioning the gradual for use in his family's private chapel or for an ecclesiastical foundation under his protection.Interplay between the naturalistic and decorative elements in the initial adds visual tension to the miniature. The artist represented the imposing physical presence of the horses, including details such as the horseshoes and armor and subtly modeling the surfaces, such as the animals' coats. He then harmoniously integrated these carefully observed figures and their details within the artificial constraints of the shape of the letterS.
Facing the viewer, Christ raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing. In his left hand he holds stone tablets inscribed with a passage from John 14:6:Ego sum via veritas vita,  I am the way and the truth and the life.  This miniature was painted by an artist in the workshop of Jan van Eyck, one of the most influential painters of the northern Renaissance. Christ's facial type, the authority of the Lord's gaze, and the expressive breadth and weight of the mantel are particularly characteristic of van Eyck.Although Christ stands on a tiled floor that seems to recede, creating a shallow three-dimensional space, the background is composed of a flat, highly decorative checkered pattern.In the short prayer accompanying the image, the petitioner makes an unusually generous appeal to God to pardon his enemies. Below the text at the bottom of the page, two young men kneel before a lord. The prayer's message may have inspired the image, as the young men seem to lay down their arms and seek forgiveness.This page was removed from a famous medieval manuscript, the Turin-Milan Hours, which was begun for Jean, duke of Berry, and worked on sporadically over the course of the next fifty years by as many as ten artists.
Underneath his metal breastplate, the standard bearer wears an elegant doublet and breeches that have been quite literally  torn to ribbons.  The fashion for slashing garments became extremely popular in Europe in the early 1500s, particularly in Germany, where it reached the most extravagant levels. Tailors cut slits in the clothing and pulled the lining through, usually to show a different color. The doublet's wide, flowing sleeves and the decorative feathered headdress show that his garb is more for display than for battle.With his left hand on his sword hilt and the right hand gripping the banner, the soldier stands at a slight angle, thrusting his hips forward to reveal his codpiece. This stance and the shadowed torso give his figure a measure of depth, integrating him with the background landscape.Discovering the artist of this small round drawing and its pair has proven difficult for scholars. It belongs to a group of approximately forty other similar works, all showing mercenary soldiers in various activities. This subject was popular in south Germany and Switzerland at the beginning of the 1500s, so many scholars assume these works came from this area.
Like other works by the Master of the BerlinRoundels, this scene shows his skill at evoking a three-dimensional space. The fifer and the drummer seem to be marching down a spiraling trail that leads to a distant castle. Both have been drawn in minute detail. Each man wears an elegant doublet and breeches that have been quite literally  torn to ribbons.  The fashion for slashing garments became extremely popular in Europe in the early 1500s, particularly in Germany, where it reached the most extravagant levels. Tailors cut slits in the clothing and pulled the lining through, usually to show a different color. The doublets' wide, flowing sleeves and the men's elaborate caps were suitable for parade wear but not for battle.Discovering the identity of the artist of this small round drawing has proven difficult for scholars. It belongs to a group of approximately forty similar works, all showing mercenary soldiers in various activities. This subject was popular in south Germany and Switzerland at the beginning of the 1500s, so many scholars assume the drawings came from that area.
Cosimo de' Migliorati, bishop of Bologna and a cardinal, commissioned this luxuriously decorated missal. It was made sometime between 1389 and 1404, the year in which he was elevated to the papacy as Innocent VII. A missal contains all the texts used for celebrating Mass, including all the chants sung by the choir but without musical notation. Only the musically elaborate portions sung by the celebrating priest are supplied with notation, suggesting that this book was designed to be used by the cardinal himself at the altar as he celebrated Mass. The elegant illuminations of the missal, consisting of decorated calendar pages, numerous historiated initials, ornamented borders, and miniatures, place the book within the tradition of Bolognese manuscript illumination. The manuscript's anonymous illuminator, known as the Master of the Brussels Initials, was trained in Bologna, a city whose book trade flourished due to the prestige and growth of the university. The Master's work is characterized by the use of vivid colors, heavily modeled figures, and borders teeming with drolleries, beasts, and acanthus leaves.
With a spare elegance, the anonymous illuminator known as the Master of the Brussels Initials decorated the missal's calendar pages, which precede the texts used for the celebration of the Mass throughout the year. The calendar notes the feasts and holidays of the church year. Since the texts of the missal are arranged according to the order in which they were said during the church year, the calendar helped the priest to identify the appropriate prayers for each day. In this missal, the calendar pages are each identified by a zodiacal sign: Aries, indicated by the ram, roughly corresponds to the month of March. The illuminator also included the representation of a Labor of the Month, corresponding to an activity traditionally associated with a particular month. Here a peasant blows two horns, heralding the coming of spring.The illuminations on this page have a distinctive grace and simplicity. The artist drew from his close observation of nature for the graceful movements of the peasant, his softly falling drapery, and the ram's delicately extended front hoof. The artist also carefully harmonized the colors, using a limited palette of blue, red, brown, and gold to unify the page.
The slaughter scene at the bottom of the page, a typical activity for the month of December, is an unpleasant subject, but the illuminator has imbued it with a quiet dignity. A horned animal under the sun, elsewhere on the page, represents the constellation Capricorn. This is the zodiacal sign for the period beginning on December 17. The inscription next to the beast reads:Sol in capricorno(the sun in Capricorn). The most important feasts of the month are written in red.
In Cosimo de' Migliorati's missal, the illuminator gave special prominence to the page for the first mass of the church year, said on the first Sunday in Advent. In the miniature of Christ in Majesty, Christ appears in a mandorla surrounded by a multitude of worshippers both male and female and prophets with their scrolls. The use of gold for the decorative acanthus swirls in the background, the halos, and the rays surrounding Christ reinforces the majestic tone. In the initial below the miniature, a bearded man offers his soul in the form of a small, naked figure to Christ above. This image was inspired by the opening verse of the introit, sung by the choir as the priest proceeds to the altar at the beginning of the Mass:  To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.  A series of richly colored acanthus leaves forms the shape of the letterAand extends into the margin.In addition to the drolleries, the border decoration originally included the arms of Cosimo de' Migliorati, but these were overpainted with the arms of a later owner of the manuscript, the Antipope John XXIII.
In a miniature of resplendent colors and sumptuous gold, the Virgin and baby Jesus welcome the three kings. The eldest king kneels in his fine robes, his crown on the ground as a gesture of humility, while the two other richly adorned kings confer behind. To the left, their attendants hold gifts of ceremonial objects, and above, the star that led the three kings along their journey twinkles in the sky. The miniature marks the introit to the mass said on Epiphany, the feast celebrating the visit of the three Magi to the Christ Child.The representation of the Adoration of the Magi gave illuminators of this period the opportunity to indulge their taste for lavish, fashionable costumes and elaborate ceremonial objects reminiscent of court life. The gold trim of the kings' cloaks contrasts with the simpler clothing of the attendants. In the historiated initial below, two sword-bearers, one dressed in a stylish two-tone outfit, seem to look up into the scene above. The inclusion of such contemporary details and the opulent use of gold were hallmarks of the International style.
Standing at the altar before a golden tabernacle and surrounded by monks and parishioners, the priest elevates the host at the climactic moment of the Mass. The illuminator expressed the tension of this great drama when the people are first shown the consecrated Eucharist: the worshippers with their varied and animated expressions seem completely caught up in the drama. Adding to the sense that the scene is capturing a specific moment, the standing monks on the left sing from a choir book with open mouths.  The scene takes place in a groin-vaulted Gothic church. The varied poses of the figures, seen in profile, three-quarter view, and from behind, stress their volumetric presence in space. The Master of the Brussels Initials was particularly inventive in the construction of three-dimensional space. This miniature appropriately prefaces the Canon of the Mass, the introduction to the ritual of the Eucharist. The text of the Canon opens with the initialT, formed by a putto holding his arms aloft between the sun and the moon, with his head tilted backwards in his efforts to see the scene above.
Christ looks heavenward as he strides out of his sarcophagus, while five Roman guards-four in the miniature and one in the initialRbelow--are asleep on their watch. The scene introduces the feast of Easter, which commemorates Christ's rising from the dead three days after his burial. The wounds Christ suffered at the Crucifixion are visible on his chest, hand, and foot, and he carries a banner symbolizing the Resurrection. Focusing our attention on the essence of the narrative, the illuminator set the scene against a gold background of stylized foliage. The border decoration, which springs from the right side of the miniature, features comical heads--human and animal--within its leafy forms.
As Saint Andrew and Saint Peter cast their nets into the Sea of Galilee, Jesus stands on the shore, calling them to follow him and become fishers of men. The two apostles turn towards Jesus with expressions of awe. Although the boat continues to glide toward the shore, Peter has already dropped his oar and folded his hands in prayer. Andrew, standing behind him, still holds his net, but his eyes are on Jesus. Below the miniature, Andrew appears in the initialD, forDominus(God), with the cross upon which he was crucified. Below, Saint Peter appears in the initialQwith his attribute, the key to heaven.The figures' heavy modeling and massive, cone-shaped bodies testify to the artist's interest in rendering objects in three-dimensional space. Surface effects still fascinated him, however, as evidenced by the miniature's swirling gold background and the curling acanthus leaves, flowers, and hybrid creatures in the border.This miniature opens the section of the missal called the Sanctorale, devoted to masses said on saints' days, beginning with the vigil of the feast of Saint Andrew.
The Discovery and Translation of the Body of Saint Anthonyrelates the remarkable life story ofSaint Anthony Abbot, followed by an account of the miracles associated with hisrelicsafter his death, both in French(Invention et translation du corps de Saint Antoine).A full-pageminiaturedivided into four scenes is devoted to each half of thenarrativenear the beginning of themanuscript, and a series ofhistoriated initialsdecorates the rest of the text. Theilluminationsare executed in agrisailletechnique, where the predominant purple-gray is sometimes heightened with gold or embellished with other touches of color.The most imposing and accomplishedilluminationin the book is a half-page miniature placed at the end that shows thepatronof the manuscript kneeling in prayer before Saint Anthony Abbot. This image, likely by theFlemishartist Dreux Jean, is surrounded by a full border that incorporates the still unidentifiedcoat of armsof the patron.
Nine interlocking studies of Christ's loincloth create an effect of restless movement across the surface of this sheet. The artist, known only as the Master of the Coburg Roundels, experimented with showing Christ's torso from various angles and wrapping the loincloth in various ways around his body. He built up the folds of most of the draperies with quick hatching and added points of visual interest by modeling four of them inwash.Theversodemonstrates a similarly lively visual interplay among its various elements. The artist first lightly sketched the two studies of book bindings, then later added two, more heavily modeled drapery studies in the center and a brass corner fitting in the upper right corner, illusionistically modeled with wash andbodycolor. The delicately drawn bookbindings are so carefully rendered that scholars can identify them as southern German, possibly made in the town of Augsburg in the late 1400s.
This miniature depicts the event in which the Holy Spirit descends on Christ's disciples, endowing them with the ability to speak foreign languages and preach throughout the world. Christ's disciples react to the event in diverse ways: one reads from a book, some hold up a finger in exclamation, one confers with a friend, and still others look up in silent awe. The scene takes place not inside a house as recounted in the Bible but underneath a Gothic tabernacle with a starred vault, which lends it an almost liturgical or ceremonial tone.The miniature comes from alaudarioof the Company of Sant'Agnese. Thelaudariocontained music to be performed by a group of pious laypeople, in this case a group devoted to Saint Agnes. The members gathered together for worship and also performed charitable works.
The Memorable Deeds and Sayings of the Romans,a compilation of stories about ancient customs and heroes written in the first century A.D. by Valerius Maximus, was widely used in the Middle Ages as a textbook for rhetoric. The museum'scuttingcomes from a French translation of the original Latin text made for Jan Crabbe, abbot of theCistercianAbbeyat Duinen, south of Bruges.This largeminiatureappeared at the beginning of book two,Concerning Morals and Customs.In a spacious dining hall, Valerius, dressed in blue on the left, instructs the Emperor Tiberius, to whom he dedicated his book, on the value of temperance. Valerius points out the joyous and intemperate peasants at the front table, who cavort wildly, drink, fall down, and sleep. In contrast, the nobles in the back are models of temperance: evenly spaced at the orderly table, their bodies rigid, they eat with great sobriety. Through this contrast theilluminatorsuggested that nobles are inherently more temperate, an interpretation that does not derive from the text. Yet in the hands of the witty Master of the DresdenPrayer Book, the bad example of the pleasure-loving peasants is easily the more endearing one.
In this luxuriousFlemishbook of hours, a full-page miniature and a pair of full borders mark the beginning of each new section. Despite their small size, theminiaturesin this book possess the breadth and expansiveness of large-scale paintings. This convincing illusion of space and atmosphere is the hallmark of the Master of the DresdenPrayer Book.Although no records show who originally owned the book when it was made at the end of the 1400s, it is known to have passed through the hands of two noble owners in the 1500s, members of the Crohin and La Fontaine families. They both added full-page miniatures with theircoats of armsto the book, indicating the pride subsequent owners took in possessing a book of such distinguished artistry.
With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.
Gloriously robed in pink, blue, green, and shimmering gold, Mary Magdalene stands quietly before a delicately renderedbackground. Her elaborate headdress and refined features remind the viewer that she was traditionally described as a beautiful young woman living an immoral life in Galilee at the time ofJesus. But the open book and ointment jar in her hands also play a role in telling her story, for she later renounced her sinful ways, anointed Jesus' feet with ointment in penance, and eventually became one of his most devoted followers.
The Epistles or letters of Saint Paul, part of the New Testament, became increasingly popular study texts in the 1500s. Humanist scholars and church reformers read them anew, inspiring luxurious copies such as this French manuscript.Elaborate borders indebted to both Italian Renaissance and Northern European art surround the manuscript's two full-page miniatures and the two facing text pages. The architectural borders of the miniature pages share many elements with  contemporary Italian architecture, both being inspired by ancient Roman buildings. The fruit and flower borders of the text pages, on the other hand, draw on Flemish designs. The layout of the text on the page followed the design used in contemporary Italian printing, and the easily readable humanist script also found its inspiration in Italian manuscripts and printed books.  The Master of the Getty Epistles, the leading artist in a workshop that specialized in illuminating devotional books, may have painted this book in the Loire valley.
Having retired to the Syrian desert for four years in order to do penance, Saint Jerome kneels before a crucifix, his body covered with self-inflicted wounds. In his hand he holds the stone with which he has been striking his chest. The anonymous illuminator of the miniature, the Master of the Getty Epistles, silhouetted Jerome's half-naked body against an area of dark green, isolating him from the distant countryside and reinforcing his self-imposed exile from civilization. Jerome's red cardinal's robe and hat hang from the broken branch of a tree. A lion, whom the saint befriended by removing a thorn from its paw, lies in the foreground smiling at the viewer.The miniature introduces a preface, once thought to have been written by Jerome, to Saint Paul's Epistles.
TheapostlePaul stands reading an open book before a spacious setting of meandering hills dotted with architectural structures. Voluminous drapery cannot conceal his rather strong and muscular body. An elaborate architectural frame reminiscent of the frames of contemporary Italianaltarpiecesreinforces the saint's majestic presence.This small painting in a book achieves a monumentality usually associated with larger independent paintings hung on a wall. From the art of theItalian Renaissance, particularly that of Michelangelo, the Master of the Getty Epistles learned to make powerful figures like Paul. FromFlemishmasters, the artist learned to set his figures within a deep panoramic landscape.
Blossoms strewn on a gold ground surround the opening text of the preface to Saint Paul's Epistles. Painted life-size and casting fictive shadows on the background, the flowers appear almost real. Nestled among the flowers are a variety of insects and a snail. The anonymous French illuminator of this page adapted his design from the illusionistic borders of earlier Flemish manuscripts, a common practice among French artists of the early 1500s. A more reserved floral motif decorates the gold ground of the initial letterPof the text.
A text page from the Getty Epistles demonstrates the profound influence of the aesthetics of printed books on manuscripts of the 1500s. The page opens with a rubric, centered and written in spacious square capitals:INCIPIT ARGUMENTUM IN EPISTOLAM BEATI PAULI APOSTOLI AD ROMANOS.The prologue of Saint Paul's letter to the Romans follows, introduced by a large initialRwithin a square field. Square capitals in gold announce the main text in another rubric, and a large initialPbegins the body of the letter. Italian printed books of the time, which featured more space between words, paragraphs, and different sections, than was traditional in earlier manuscripts, inspired the spaciousness of this presentation and the styles of script, including the large initials. The border design with fruits and flowers shows the influence of contemporary Flemish manuscript illumination.
The large letterRon a gold ground begins the text of a preface to Saint Paul's Epistle to the Romans, followed by the rest of the wordRomaniin square capital letters. The anonymous scribe wrote most of the text in a rounded script that imitates the typeface of contemporary Italian printed books. The framing gold fillet that terminates in a stylized knot at the bottom is the usual treatment for the less elaborate text pages of this book.
The most famous historical record of Europe in the 1300s, the monumentalChroniclewas written in French(Chroniques)by Jean Froissart and recounts the major political and military events from around 1322 to 1410. Focusing on the rivalry between England and France, theChronicleis a basic resource for the study of theHundred Years' War. Froissart also described the affairs of other realms, though largely as they related to the complex network of overlapping and shifting alliances around England and France.The Getty Museum'smanuscriptcontains the third of four books; its 730 pages cover only the period from 1358 to 1389, an indication of the level of detail Froissart sought to impart. The Museum's volume, from about 1480, shows the lasting esteem that theChronicleenjoyed: new copies of the text were still being made about seventy years after the author's death. The book was made inFlanders, perhaps in Bruges. The choice of subjects for the sixty-fourminiaturesstrongly emphasizes events involving the English, evidence perhaps that the book was produced for the English market. Indeed,King Edward IV, who built the first royal library in England, may have commissioned it.
Although Jean Froissart focused mainly on political maneuverings and battles in his Chronicle, he also wrote about the problems experienced by the papacy. This image illustrates the confusing situation brought about by the Great Schism, which began in 1378 with the election of different popes by two opposing groups of cardinals.Early in 1378, a group of primarily Italian cardinals elected Urban VI as pope. Later that same year, an opposing group of French cardinals elected Clement VII as pope, and he established the seat of his papacy in Avignon, France. In this image, Urban VI sits at the right, and Clement VII sits at the left, flanked by his supporters. King Charles V of France, who accepted the validity of Clement's election, stands at the far left wearing robes bearing fleurs-de-lis, the French royal insignia. The artist indicated the hostility between the groups by depicting figures from the opposing parties back-to-back instead of facing one another.
In this miniature from Jean Froissart'sChronicle, the illuminator presented a startlingly fresh image of the English navy anchored near the mouth of the Thames in Margate where they lie in wait to capture rich Flemish merchants and their goods. The miniature suggests the material power and readiness of the English navy. On a bare shore, a single tower with a banner stands beside three loaded ships. Their hulls extend in bulging curves, suggesting their great weight, and soldiers in full armor crowd the decks. The rolled-up sails indicate that their voyage has not yet begun, but it is clearly imminent.The artist rendered precise details of ship construction, including the enormous rudders, the intricate rigging, and the overlapping planks of wood that form the hulls. Conditions of weather and water also interested him: the lively waves breaking against the hulls have whitecaps, and the darkening clouds on the left indicate that a storm is brewing. The storm serves an additional function by alluding symbolically to the coming conflict of war.
The popularity of Jean Froissart'snarrativederived in part from the author's taste for dramatic stories, exemplified by the death of the king of Navarre, shown in thisminiature. Froissart recounted that the king, while awaiting his young mistress, called for his bed to be warmed. His servant proceeded in the usual way, but there was a disastrous mishap: the bed caught fire and the king died of his burns several days later. Froissart remained ambiguous about whether the fire was intentionally set, attributing the death to  God or the devils.  The artist communicated the possibility of conspiracy by presentingcourtiersin the room, whispering among themselves while the king burns in his bed. As vivid orange and yellow flames rise around the king's pillows, the figure in tights stands in an elegant dancelike pose that seems utterly inappropriate to the disaster. In his rendering of setting and characters, the artist revealed an interest in observing the natural world. He differentiated textures of wood, stone, and tile and attended to details of the figures that make them convincing as representations of living humans, such as the puffed-up cheeks of the servant blowing his bellows and the carefully modeled anatomy of the king's naked upper body.
Jean Froissart'snarrativefocusing on theHundred Years' Warnot only encompassed the major political intrigues and battles of the 1300s but also examined marriages among the nobility. Marriages were an important tool in the art of politics because they created and affirmed strategic alliances. In thisminiaturetheilluminatorpresented the marriage ofLouis de BloisandMarie de France, the daughter of the duke of Berry, in 1386. The couple stands before a church surrounded by friends, family, and attendants. Consistent with contemporary artistic traditions, the couple wears the extravagant fashions of the Burgundian court in the illuminator's day, rather than the costumes of the 1300s when they were actually married. Marie is sumptuously dressed, wearing a crown and jeweled belt, and both she and Louis wear capes bordered with ermine.The illuminator departed from the text in the representation of the couple's age. Froissart described Louis as a child in his mother'sarms, but the illuminator rendered both Marie and Louis as adults.
In theminiatureaccompanying the report of a 1380s war between theFlemishduchies of Brabant and Gelders in Jean Froissart'sChronicle,the soldiers of Brabant quietly advance to attack the city of Ravenstein. As troops pass stealthily through a dramatic nocturnal landscape, the sun's last rays create a range of effects, illuminating billowing clouds, metallic armor, and a river whose glassy waters reflect the arches of a bridge. With the vista defined by a rocky hillside in theforeground, forbidding city walls in themiddle ground, and a meandering river extending into the distance, this is one of the most developed spatial perspectives in themanuscript. The artist's interest innaturalisticeffects, however, also served a dramatic purpose. The falling darkness and stillness of the scene heighten the tension of the Brabant soldiers' imminent attack.
These leaves displaying chants, musical notation, and initials filled with figural scenes come from an antiphonal made for a Benedictine monastery in Bohemia (the modern-day Czech Republic). Antiphonals contain all of the chants sung by choirs of monks or nuns during the divine office (the cycle of prayers said at specific hours throughout the day). In the most luxurious examples, each chant in an antiphonal begins with a large decorative letter that acts as a bookmark for the singers. The elegant figures that fill the initials in this manuscript reflect an artistic style known as the International style, which was closely associated with the courts of Paris and Prague around the year 1400.
This initial H features Saint Stephen, dressed as a church deacon, holding and contemplating the stones with which he was martyred. Golden birds writhe in the background behind Stephen, echoing the saint's gently swaying posture, as well as the leafy foliage sprouting from the corners of the initial. The text that the letter introduces,Hesterna die dominus natus(Yesterday the Lord was born) is the chant sung on the feast day of Saint Stephen on December 26, the day after Christmas.
At left, the priest Melchizedek offers a golden vessel to the patriarch Abraham, who kneels before him with his army. According to a biblical story, Melchizedek presented Abraham and his associates with bread and wine after they returned victorious from battle. Medieval Christians viewed this event as a precursor to the offering of bread and wine at mass, which symbolizes Christ's sacrifice of his body and blood. The sacrificial theme of this image reflects the use of this chant it introduces, which was sung during the penitential season of Lent.
The prophet Isaiah sits enthroned before a luxurious green textile--decorated with delicate birds-- which signifies his importance. He raises his right hand to emphasize the Latin phrase that the letter introduces,Ecce nunc tempus acceptabile(Now is the acceptable time), a biblical passage starting that the moment of salvation is at hand.
Illuminatedby the bright light of a graceful angel above, shepherds in the fields outside Bethlehem shield their eyes as they kneel in homage. The angel announces the birth ofJesus, but the impassive faces of the peasants show that they do not yet grasp the importance of the message. Using a mutedpaletteof blues and gold, the Master of the HoughtonMiniaturesevoked the stillness and beauty of a nocturnal landscape. The scene is lit only by the glow of the angel high in the sky, by a diminutive ballet ofgildedangels gliding down toward the manger in the stable beyond, and by the light within the stable itself.  In this miniature the shepherds have the coarse and rugged features of the peasants seen in paintings by theFlemishartistHugo van der Goes. Their richly modeled and precisely contoured faces have no equal in Flemishmanuscriptillumination. The artist's achievement innaturalismis all the more remarkable considering the very small format of the miniature. The miniature probably came from an elaborate illuminatedbook of hoursthat is now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
This design for a stained-glass quatrefoil (four-lobed form) portrays scenes of courtly love. At left, a couple on horseback are shown hunting with a falcon. At right, a maiden, accompanied by an eager fool, promenade through a forest. Below, a reclining couple enjoy an amorous dalliance beside a trough. The top lobe features a castle above a rocky landscape.The empty field in the center of the sheet is a placeholder for a coat of arms and suggests that the stained glass could have been made for a royal residence or official building. This drawing is likely a simplified copy by an artist in the workshop of the Master of the Housebook. It was intended as a model for a glass painter. Several steps and a variety of craftspeople were involved in making stained glass. After the artist drew the overall composition, a glass painter painted the design onto pieces of clear and colored glass. In order to allow light to penetrate through the painted design, the glass painter stippled, scratched, and scrubbed away some of the paint before the glass was stained and set into a lead framework.
In northeastern France, probably in the area around Noyon, an anonymous artist known as the Master of the Ingeborg Psalter illuminated this psalter shortly after 1205. Almost certainly made for a wealthy layperson for use in private prayer, the book contains the 150 psalms and other poetic texts from the Bible, preceded by a calendar indicating the particular saints and events to be remembered on each day of the year.The book's program of illumination originally consisted of large painted initials at Psalms 1, 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101, and 109, dividing the text of the psalms into ten sections. Regrettably, the initial for Psalm 1 was removed from the manuscript long ago and is now lost. The remaining nine initials constitute a stunning display of the achievements of the psalter's illuminator. Many of the initials feature King David, who is often shown acting out the psalm's opening verse.
Samuel, aprophetrenowned throughout the land, pours oil from a flask over the head of the youngDavid, who was summoned so hurriedly from the fields where he tended sheep that he still grasps his shepherd's crook. David's anointing signaled the special role he would play in the future as the King of Israel. The image, which introducesPsalm26, was inspired by the psalm's title,  The psalm of David before he was anointed. 
A demon tugs on David's cloak, tempting him to sin with his tongue, as warned against in the first line of thepsalm:  I said I will heed my ways that I not sin with my tongue.  Theilluminatormasterfully rendered David's jaw, clenched against the demon's temptation. An angel rushes in from the clouds and points to David's eye, which may be a reference to his lustful spying on Bathsheba. Medieval commentators associated Psalm 38 with David's sin of sending Bathsheba's husband to be killed in battle, leaving him free to pursue her.
Jealous of David's popularity at court following his defeat of Goliath, King Saul draws his sword against the young David. In the face of this danger, the boy flees with his harp. This scene illustrates the opening phrase of the following text, Psalm 51:  Why do you glory in malice, you who are mighty in iniquity   The illuminator portrayed Saul's evil intentions through the demon that grasps Saul's cloak with one hand while pointing to the fleeing David with the other..
An enthroned man wearing a fool's cap illustrates the opening verse ofPsalm52- The fool says in his heart 'There is no God.'  The scroll he holds proclaims this heresy:Non e[st] Deu[s](There is no God). Two mischievous demons incite him to this thought, while an angel above attempts to warn the fool against such a notion.
Within the opening letterSofPsalm68, the anonymousilluminatorof thismanuscriptshowed theOld TestamentkingDavidkneeling and looking up in prayer, with a winged demon at his side.Christ, flanked by angels, appears in the top of the initial and offers his blessing. The illuminator used the shape of the letterS,together with the inclusion of the angels and the demon, to draw a stark contrast between the celestial and earthly realms.
Decorated with with curling stems, leaves, and fantastic animals, the initialEintroducingPsalm80 is the only one of the nine painted initials in this FrenchGothicpsalterthat does not contain a figural scene. The complex leaf form at the center, which partially curls around the central horizontal of the letter, dwarfs the birds and beasts. Through a brilliant design, theilluminatorarranged the initial's decorative elements into a bold, centralizedcompositionin apaletteof gold, saturated blue, and rusty red.
Within the opening letterCof Psalm 97, King David plays a carillon of bells, accompanied by two companion musicians. According to the Hebrew bible, David led other musicians in musical rituals connected with the installation of the Ark of the Covenant in Jerusalem. Furthermore, the abundant textual references to musical instruments in the psalms inspired medieval illuminators to choose musical scenes to illustrate them.Especially characteristic of the monumentality of the style of the manuscript's anonymous illuminator is the imposing and substantial figure of David, which both fills the initial and has a weighty quality. This illusion of three-dimensionality finds parallels in northern French sculpture of the time.
Buffeted by a wind that represents his adversaries, KingDavidaddresses his prayer to an angel above. The image illustratesPsalm101, which begins with the wordsLord, hear my prayer.The illuminator's portrayal of the wind's power, affecting not only David's garments but also his hair, makes the wind as much a subject of the initial as David himself, isolated against a plain goldbackground. Theilluminatormade it clear, however, that David's prayer has been heard, because the angel's arm reaches from outside the letterDinto David's space.
Within an initialD,Christ, flanked by angels, sits on a throne with a small figure, bent over in submission, under each foot. Theilluminatorshowed Christ's garments falling in natural, asymmetrical folds that give the sense of a three-dimensional body beneath. This volumetric presence of Christ is an important component in conveying his utter dominance of the enemies at his feet--the topic of the first sentence ofPsalm109:  I will make a footstool of your enemies. 
The Getty Museum's imposingmanuscriptof PortuguesehumanistVasco da Lucena'sBook of the Deeds ofAlexander the Greatis the product of the interest inclassical antiquitythat characterizedRenaissancehumanism. The text is a French translation(Livre des fais d'Alexandre le grant),completed in 1468, of a biography of theMacedonianconqueror Alexander the Great by the first-century Roman writer Quintus Curtius Rufus. In this manuscript's text andminiatures, Alexander is presented as a complex figure, a man capable of bravery and good judgment but also subject to human foibles. Both the positive and negative lessons of Alexander's story were considered valuable for a Renaissance prince and military leader such asCharles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, to whom Vasco dedicated his text.The Getty Museum's copy of this widely diffused text, a large and lavishlyilluminated manuscriptwith fourteen miniatures, was probably made for an aristocrat associated with the Burgundian court, someone who would have particularly appreciated the manuscript's scenes of battle and court intrigue. While the scribe Jean du Quesne copied the text in Lille, the anonymousilluminator, who has been identified as the Master of theJardin de vertueuse consolation,worked in Bruges.
Vasco da Lucena, who translated the original Latin biography ofAlexander the Greatby Quintus Curtius Rufus into French, kneels as he presents his book toCharles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Some of the nobles standing in the room wear the collars or pendant of the chivalricOrder of the Golden Fleece. The lavish red bed in thebackgroundprovides a visual link to the followingminiatureof the birth of Alexander, suggesting a flattering parallel between Charles, the book'spatron, and Alexander the Great.
Thenarrativeof the exploits of theMacedonianleaderAlexander the Greatbegins with his portentous birth, illustrated in thisminiature. In the main scene, his mother Olympias, wife ofPhilip of Macedon, sits up in bed to hand the newborn infant Alexander to her ladies-in-waiting. Wearing sumptuous garments and elaborate hats, they gesture in excitement. The dragon flying above Olympias's head refers to Alexander's supposed divine origin: According to theDelphic oracle, Olympias conceived Alexander by the god Zeus Ammon disguised as a dragon.To the right, theilluminatorincluded a later episode: Still a child, Alexander gains mastery over Bucephalus, the sturdy war horse that will take him to his later military victories. By depicting the burningTemple of Diana at Ephesusin thebackground, the illuminator also referred to Alexander's future defeat of Asia.The illuminator made the ancient story concrete and accessible by depicting the scene in a fifteenth-century setting. The raised canopy bed with velvet bedspread and hangings, the sideboard with plate and ewers, and the fabrics and fashions of the women's luxuriously detailed dresses all reflect the lavish style of the Burgundian court.
Alexander the Greatemerges naked from the Cydnus River, whose cold waters have made him ill. Seen later in his tent on the left, Alexander accepts the treatment of his physician Philip, even though Philip has been accused of plotting Alexander's demise. In thebackground, the Persian Sisinnes is beheaded for treason: He had failed to report his knowledge of an assassination attempt against Alexander.
Standing at the center of the lead ship in gold armor,Alexander the Greatdirects the naval assault on thePhoeniciancity of Tyre in January 332 B.C.
Before the impressive stone battlements of a conquered city whose gateway is marked with his name,Alexander the Greathosts games among his troops. The games were designed to boost his troops' morale as they marched from Babylon to Susa. Surrounded by dandily dressed members of the army, an acrobat performs gymnastics while another man hoists a large stone. Rather than emphasizing the physical demands of the games, the artist made the soldiers into a splendid sight in robes of rich saturated reds, blues, and greens with goldhighlights, giving theminiaturea luxurious feel and courtly tone.The women standing at the right derive from another episode. With their lavish headresses and sumptuous gowns, they represent members of the family of the defeated Persian ruler Darius. Alexander consistently treated these captive women with respect and magnanimity because of their nobility. The artist may have linked this episode with that of the games because both illustrate Alexander's generosity.
In a setting reminiscent of the rich interiors of the Burgundian court,Alexander the Greatsits enthroned beneath a canopy at a banquet table. He calls before him one of the women he noticed among the Persian captives. As she kneels before him, he recognizes her as the niece ofArtaxerxes III, an earlier king of Persia. Alexander orders an attendant to return her belongings, which he passes to her in a wooden casket. He also orders a search for her husband, who may be the figure in the long blue robe in theforeground.This episode from the conqueror's history demonstrates Alexander's princely character, magnanimous even toward a captive because of her noble birth. Theilluminatorchose not to represent Quintus Curtius Rufus's description of Alexander's drinking at the banquet, because that would have been an example of debauchery indicative of Alexander's moral decline.In thisminiaturedepicting Alexander's court life, a blue and gold tapestry hangs on the back wall and Alexander sits at a richly set table on a raised platform. Well-dressedcourtiersand musicians around him attend to his needs. The illuminator set up a deepperspectivereceding into space within the great hall.
Bagoas, a handsomeeunuchin the originalnarrativebut a beautiful woman in Vasco da Lucena's translation and in theminiature, stands before Alexander in a green gown. She wants to persuade Alexander to pardon Nabarzanes, a Persian who had plotted against the Persian king, Darius III. At the right, Queen Thalestris of theAmazonsapproaches with her followers, hoping that she can persuade Alexander to father a child with her. Although this is just the sort of story that Vasco dismissed as  false and impossible,  he reported it in his translation, and the artists followed his lead by including it in the miniature.
Because his army had become overburdened with the spoils from its conquest of the Persian empire, Alexander the Great ordered the burning of the army's excess baggage, beginning with his own.
Thisminiatureshows the execution of Philotas, one of the many military officers who plotted againstAlexander the Great. A beheaded co-conspirator lies in front of him.
Alexander the Greatsurveys the building of a new city, Alexandria-in-Caucaso, at the foot of the Hindu-Kush mountains. Alexander later established his headquarters here as he launched his campaign into Bactria. It was one of seventy cities he founded in an effort to consolidate his rule over lands he had conquered.
In front of the remains of a drunken banquet, the young king Alexander stabs the general Clitus. Alexander had belittled the achievements of his own father, King Philip ofMacedonia. This enraged Clitus, one of the old generals of the Macedonian army, who spoke out against the young king. Alexander then killed him. Outside on the right, another scene unfolds. Using a spiked club, Alexander slays a lion. Although the text describes his weapon as a hunting spear, the club shown here suggests a parallel between Alexander andHerakles, who fought theNemean lionwith his club.
In a suit of golden armor,Alexander the Greatbattles valiantly in the town of the Sudracae in India. Having foolishly jumped over the ramparts into the enemy city without reinforcements, he must defend himself in prolonged hand-to-hand combat. Theilluminatorused thedeviceof a cut-away view of the city wall in order to show both Alexander within the town and his army outside, attempting to scale the wall to come to his rescue.The entire scene is presented in fifteenth-century guise, with the town of the Sudracae resembling a northern European walled city more than anything Indian. Both theMacedonianand the Indian soldiers are outfitted in the battle gear of the illuminator's time, with little attention paid to distinguishing between the two armies, either in weaponry or in ethnicity. This would have given the scene particular immediacy for a fifteenth-century European reader, especially one who himself might be called upon to serve his leader in battle.
Inside a palatial hall, Orsines, a Persian military leader, kneels before Alexander to offer a gift. As Quintus Curtius Rufus's text recounts, although Orsines gives lavish gifts to Alexander's retinue, he snubs Alexander's lover Bagoas. Furious at being spurned, Bagoas turns Alexander against Orsines. Consistent with his increasingly immoral behavior, Alexander, under the sway of his lover, orders Orsines's death. The execution takes place outdoors at the right. Here, as Alexander and Bagaos watch from the palace steps, an executioner raises his sword above the kneeling Orsines.Although described in Curtius's account as aeunuch, Vasco's translation turned Bagoas into a woman, considered by the fifteenth-century audience to be a more appropriate match for Alexander. Theilluminatorfollowed suit, representing Bagoas as a beautiful woman, richly attired in Burgundian fashion.In thisminiature, which opens the last chapter of Vasco's text, the illuminator presented the story in two sequential moments arranged side by side. Yet, despite the appearance that the interior and exterior correspond to different views of the same building, the landscape on the right differs from that seen through the door at the left and is shallower than the deep interior space on the left.
An agent ofAlexander the Greatstabs the general Parmenion to death as he reads a letter. Parmenion believed the letter was from his son, the traitor Philotas, but, in fact, Alexander had forged the letter to test his general's loyalty. Alexander had suspected the general's willingness to betray his cause, and Parmenion's pleased reaction to the letter, which suggested that Alexander should desist from future conquests, confirmed his doubts.
This profusely illuminatedFlemishbook of hoursoffers an unusual reversal of what is expected. While borders are customarily visually subordinate tominiatures, the lush foliage in the borders of thismanuscript'smost outstanding pages captures the reader's attention and gives unity to the double-page spreads.Theilluminationsare the work of several artists, the most talented of whom is known as the Master of Guillebert de Mets. His miniatures are painted on single leaves, which were inserted into the manuscript. This fact suggests that he did not work in close collaboration with the scribes who produced the text. The style of his paintings reveals that the artist had abackgroundin the ParisianInternational style, yet his bold handling of borders with their rich vegetation and energetically twisting banderoles is unique.
On this calendar page, the two small squareminiaturesat the bottom each relate to the month of April. On the left, a young man jauntily carries a leafy branch across a green field under a blue sky, all indications that Spring has arrived. To the right, a bull takes a peaceful rest under the same blue sky, its thin clouds represented by loose strokes of white paint. The bull is the symbol for Taurus, the zodiacal sign for much of April. Above the two miniatures, the feast days and saints' days for the month appear in alternating lines of red and blue.
Two angels spread their arms to gesture that theVirgin Marywith the infantJesusis a celestial vision. Although the Virgin appears to be seated on the ground--a sign of humility--the canopy overhead alludes to her role as theQueen of Heaven. Thisminiature, together with the one on the facing page, introduces the text of theMassof the Virgin, as indicated by therubricat the top of the page:Incipitmissa de domina n[ost]ra, Here begins the Mass of Our Lady.
Within a letter O, the stiff and emaciated body of the deadChristextends across the lap of theVirgin Mary, who is seated at the foot of the cross. Mary Magdalene andSaint John the Evangelistjoin the Virgin in mourningJesus. The scene introduces one of the most popular medieval prayers addressed to the Virgin Mary, theObsecro te,which begins:  I beseech you, Mary, holy lady, mother of God, most full of piety, most glorious mother, the way for those who stray, the salvation for those who hope in you, virgin before, during, and after birth, come and hasten to my aid and counsel.  The jesters in the border bear no relationship to the page's text. They are a part of the whimsical visual vocabulary of late medievalilluminators.
This finely illustrated book of hours takes its name from the Baron Llangattock, who owned the book in the 1900s. The manuscript is of particular interest because a number of its miniatures are closely related to compositions by the celebrated panel painter Jan van Eyck. The influence of van Eyck's style is most clearly seen in the manuscript's fourteen full-page miniatures. A full-page miniature opens each of the book's major texts, with eight devoted to the Hours of the Virgin, the most important section of a book of hours. The suffrages, or prayers addressed to individual saints, are illustrated with a series of historiated initials.A number of artists participated in illuminating the manuscript, and in at least one example two illuminators collaborated on a single miniature, which required a high level of coordination. The anonymous artists known as the Master of the Llangattock Hours and the Master of the Llangattock Epiphany are both named for their work in this manuscript.

With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.
This leaf depicts a story from the life of Saint Jerome (about 341 - 420), one of the four doctors of the Church. One day, a lion entered the monastery where Jerome resided, causing his fellow monks to flee, but Jerome recognized that the beast was injured and he cured it by removing a thorn from its paw. The saint's monumental form fills the foreground of the composition, setting off the delicate gold tweezers Jerome uses to extract the thorn. In the background, a monk approaches with a pot of ointment and a bandage. The encounter between man and animal, in which Jerome comes to the lion's aid, is poignant, showing the moment when the lion submits to the saint, the saint's concentration as he removes the thorn, and the apprehensiveness of the attendant monk.This cutting likely represents a large miniature or initial from a gradual probably commissioned for the Camaldolese monastery of San Mattia in Murano. This manuscript was one of the most lavish and elaborately illuminated Lombard choir book commissions of the fifteenth century. The artist responsible for its decoration it is known as the Master of the Murano Gradual. This illuminator likely worked between the regions of Lombardy and the Veneto and he is notable for his originality and his imposing figures clothed in voluminous drapery, their faces strongly modeled and expressive.
In this initial, the face of Saint Blaise is sharply defined, craggy, and hard-edged, yet the powder blue robe and the fine tooled lines in the gold ground lend the monumental figure a kind of ethereal delicacy. These contrasting qualities of exaggerated expression and refined beauty inform the illumination style of the work's artist, the Master of the Murano Gradual. This initial was probably made for the manuscript that gives the Master his name, a gradual made for the Camaldolese monastery of San Mattia in Murano. Saint Blaise, a fourth-century bishop in Armenia, was martyred with a wool carder's brush, the red object he holds in his hand in the illumination.
Saint Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, baptizes the adult Saint Augustine as he kneels on the rose and green marble floor of a church. Augustine's mother, Saint Monica, watches the event from the right.The illuminator almost certainly made this lively, colorful miniature for a choir book belonging to a congregation of Augustinian priests in Siena. The initial probably introduced the chants for a feast associated with Saint Augustine or Saint Monica. Scholars have not been able to establish a more precise identification, though they have associated it with other cuttings believed to be from the same manuscript.
In a barren, mountainous landscape, the three wise kings Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar meet to continue their journey to Bethlehem. Heralds on prancing horses blare trumpets to proclaim the unification of humankind at the birth ofJesus. On the peaked mountains above, the kings appear again at an earlier moment. Their diminutive figures stand or kneel, watching for the star that will lead them to their king. In the right and left corners of theforeground,IsaiahandDavidhold scrolling banners inscribed with theOld Testamentprophecies of the Adoration of theMagi. TheAssumption of the Virginappears on the other side of this panel. Borne aloft by musical angels, theVirgin Maryslowly ascends to be crownedQueen of Heavenby God the Father above. Circles ofpastelcolors--yellow, pink, and blue--radiate from her, ending with clouds painted in each corner of thecomposition.Analtarpiecewing functions like a door to a cabinet. Artists often painted both sides of a wing so that a picture would be visible whether the  door  was opened or closed. Because this panel is painted on two sides, it may have once formed part of such a wing.
The most famous historical record of Europe in the 1300s, the monumentalChroniclewas written in French(Chroniques)by Jean Froissart and recounts the major political and military events from around 1322 to 1410. Focusing on the rivalry between England and France, theChronicleis a basic resource for the study of theHundred Years' War. Froissart also described the affairs of other realms, though largely as they related to the complex network of overlapping and shifting alliances around England and France.The Getty Museum'smanuscriptcontains the third of four books; its 730 pages cover only the period from 1358 to 1389, an indication of the level of detail Froissart sought to impart. The Museum's volume, from about 1480, shows the lasting esteem that theChronicleenjoyed: new copies of the text were still being made about seventy years after the author's death. The book was made inFlanders, perhaps in Bruges. The choice of subjects for the sixty-fourminiaturesstrongly emphasizes events involving the English, evidence perhaps that the book was produced for the English market. Indeed,King Edward IV, who built the first royal library in England, may have commissioned it.
Within an impressive stone house surrounded by an extensive walled garden, the poet, historian, and cleric Jean Froissart, author of theChronicle, kneels before theCount of Foix. Raising his hat in homage, Froissart presents a letter of introduction, hoping to conduct research for his book. Thisminiatureon the opening pages of the third volume of Froissart's account of European events of the 1300s asserts the eyewitness quality of his history by presenting him in person before one of his sources. For hisnarrative, Froissart interviewed witnesses, drew upon his own direct observation, and recorded gossip accumulated from frequent stays at the courts of England and France.The taste of the dukes of Burgundy for large,illuminatedhistory books was shared by other rulers who also patronizedFlemishartists. An important member of the English court, perhaps even the king himself, probably commissioned this copy of the third book of Froissart'sChronicle. The owner is not known, however, since parts of the border of this opening page that were destined for the owner'sheraldryand motto were left unfinished.
On the porch at the left, a Portuguese diplomat accepts a golden cup, a gift from Richard II of England. The presentation of the gift signified that Richard had agreed to support Portugal in its war efforts. On the right, inside a building, the Portuguese delegation arrives home to recount its success with the English. The king of Portugal sits beneath a cloth canopy greeting his ambassador. The strong vertical pillar of the building both divides theminiatureinto two distinct scenes and helps to inform the viewer that the two events are separated in time and place.
A man in a white tunic at the center of the scene greets the man in the blue robe with a kiss, distracting him while stabbing him in the side. Although the exact identity of the men is unclear, the scene may depict anOld Testamentstory about Joab, who committed murder on two separate occasions (2 Kings 3:27, and 2 Kings 20:8-10). These murders are often seen as precursors for the story ofJudasbetrayalofChrist. Thisminiaturemay, therefore, have originally been part of a cycle of typological Passion images in apsalterorbook of hours.The Master of Trinity College Ms. B.11.7 depicts the figures in elaborate costumes with naturalistically textured surfaces, as was characteristic ofInternational stylepainting. Three of the men wear polished silver armor, and the lower portion of the victim's robe is covered with a dense gold pattern composed of the repeated inscription,  O Mors  (O Death), indicating his fate.
In the early 1400s in the northern Netherlands, a new dynamic cultural circle developed under the patronage of Albrecht of Bavaria, Count of Holland. In a workshop closely associated with the count, the anonymous artists known as the Masters of Dirc van Delf illuminated this book of hours, perhaps for a member of Albrecht's family or one of his courtiers. These artists, who worked in the International style that so appealed to aristocratic taste across Europe, formed one of the first important illuminators' workshops of fifteenth-century Holland.While the Hours of the Virgin were most often illustrated with miniatures showing the Life of the Virgin, this book illustrates these services with scenes from the Passion of Christ. With their powerful dramatic style, the eight full-page miniatures provide visual meditations on the meaning of the story of Jesus, fostering the viewer's empathy for his supreme sacrifice. Historiated initials and decorated borders complete the decorative scheme.
Within the shallow, almost claustrophobic space of this miniature, Judas betrays Jesus with a kiss, a pre-arranged signal that alerts the Roman soldiers to Jesus' identity. On the left, the apostle Peter raises his sword to cut off the Roman soldier Malchus's ear. Clad in bright green, this small figure falls awkwardly to the ground before Jesus. On the right, soldiers muscle in to arrest Jesus.Pushing, gesturing soldiers on one side and Peter's upraised sword on the other overlap the image's frame. The artist crowded the composition in this way to heighten the scene's emotion and tension. Collapsed at the miniature's bottom edge, the figure of Malchus plays an important role, extending the pictorial space into the unpainted margin and drawing the viewer into the painting in this tiny book.
Within this initialD, the Madonna of Humility sits humbly on the ground. Despite her lowly pose, the anonymous artist or artists, known as the Masters of Dirc van Delf, reminded the viewer of the Virgin's lofty status as the Queen of Heaven by showing her crowned and celebrated by a music-making angel in the upper border. The theme of the Madonna of Humility became popular in the 1400s as Christians increasingly focused on the human qualities of holy figures. The artist(s) further emphasized the Virgin's humanity by representing her nursing the infant Jesus.The rubric,Incipiunt hore de domina n[ost]ra(The hours of our Lady begin), introduces the Matins text of the Hours of the Virgin, which begins with a verse from Psalm 50:Domine labia mea aperies et os meum annunciabit laude[m] tuam(Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise). An ornate, burnished gold leaf border with vines and bold blue and red leaves almost entirely encloses the text, including the initial. The bear and the vignette of a man battling a griffin in the border are not related thematically to the image of the Virgin.
The miniatures in the book of hours by the Masters of Dirc van Delf dramatically present a sequence of events from Jesus' Passion, the events leading up to the Crucifixion. Within this context, the miniature of Christ before Pilate serves as a visual focus for the prayers that follow. Pilate, the Roman prefect in Jerusalem who presided at Jesus' trial and gave the order for his Crucifixion, sits on a throne. Jesus' sad but patient expression suggests his acceptance of his fate.This confrontation between Pilate and Christ takes place within a shallow architectural setting much like a stage, with a flat, curtainlike, gold-patterned background behind. But the shallow space cannot contain the corporeal figures, who stand in front of the miniature's frame so that the figure of Jesus is presented both to Pilate and to the viewer. The solid weight of the figures and the frame contrasts with the delicacy of the fine sprays of leaves and flowers extending from the frame.
In this miniature of the Lamentation, Jesus' twisting body faces the viewer as his lifeless limbs extend in front of the frame on three sides. The tender assistance of the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist draws attention to Jesus' wounds, stimulating the viewer's meditation on his sacrifice. His wounds are graphically rendered as open gashes dripping with blood. The saturated primary colors of the frame and draperies further set off Jesus' pale, emaciated body. Behind the figures, the pink cross picks up the faint, glowing hues of his suffering body. The full-page Lamentation appears within a sequence of images retelling the Passion story in this book of hours, the most popular type of private devotional manuscript of the later Middle Ages. The miniature of the Virgin and John mourning over the body of Jesus was particularly appropriate to a culture interested in devotional practices. Inspired by a burgeoning literature describing his torments, pious individuals increasingly focused their meditations on Jesus' suffering.
In this miniature of the Entombment, the Virgin, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus, their eyes expressing sadness, gently lay Jesus' body into the tomb. The Virgin contemplates her son's face and the meaning of his death, on which the viewer is also called to meditate. The figures' broad forms extend beyond the confines of the painted frame, blurring the distinction between the miniature's and the viewer's space. The viewer is thus invited into the scene, especially by the figure on the right, who turns in toward Jesus in a position analogous to that of the observer.While the artist created naturalistic, three-dimensional figures and a seemingly weighty sculpted sarcophagus, he still placed them before a traditional flat pattern of small, colored squares or diamonds, an abstract design called a diapered ground.
This missal (a book containing the necessary texts for the celebration of mass) is illuminated with four large historiated initials and lavish decorated borders filled with cameos, gems, flowers, and hybrid creatures. The painting in the manuscript is both technically precise and conceptually playful. The figures inhabiting the initials have the minutely rendered details of manuscript illumination while still asserting a monumental presence. The border elements are as creative as the finest Italian manuscripts, executed with a wit that leaves the viewer wondering where the observation of nature leaves off and artifice begins.The manuscript's artist, Matteo da Milano, was known for his lively, colorful palette, robust modeling, and a penchant for exotic details of costume. He was among the most important and successful artists of the beginning of the 1500s in Rome. This manuscript was commissioned by a member of the powerful Orsini family, which can be determined by the appearance in the borders of the Orsini arms and the device of little bears (orsiniin Italian).
In thisillusionisticceiling painting, figures and objects areforeshortenedso that they actually seem to exist in the space above the viewer. The impression is one of infinite receding distance. Against a blue sky,puttiand other seemingly weightless figures float on clouds and hover in mid-air. Light green, blue, yellow, gold, red, and orange colors blend harmoniously to create an effect of dazzling brilliance.Painted as the final model for the ceilingfrescoof the great hall in the imperial palace in Innsbruck, Austria, thisallegoryrepresents two marriages between the families of Hapsburg and Lorraine. Themodellocelebrates HapsburgEmpress Maria Theresa'sunion of forty years earlier with Frans Stephen of Lorraine. Also honored is an even earlier marriage between the grandfather of Frans Stephan and one of the empress's paternal ancestors. Franz Anton Maulbertsch depicts the latter couple on the twomedallionscarried aloft by winged figures. In a triumphal carriage below, two figures--allegoricalpersonificationsof the two families--grasp hands while ahostof angels and other symbolic figures look on approvingly.
Professor Samuel F. B. Morse, the American inventor who pioneered the development of the telegraph, was also trained as a painter and earned his living through portraiture while a young man. In the winter of 1838-1839, he traveled to Paris to present his electric telegraph to the Academy of Sciences. While there, he took the opportunity to meet with his fellow inventor Jacques Louis Mand Daguerre. Morse promptly dispatched an account of the meeting, with an enthusiastic description of the French inventor's revolutionary new photographic process, to the editor of theNew York Observerin a letter of March 9, 1839.     Morse himself became one of the earliest exponents of thedaguerreotypein America, opening a portrait studio with J.W. Draper in New York in 1840. In this portrait, he demonstrated a sophisticated awareness of the camera through his steady composure and fixed gaze.
Once the secret of makingdaguerreotypeswas announced to the French public on August 19, 1839, fever for photography ran high in Paris. Jacques Louis Mand Daguerre had relinquished his patent on the process, which caused a great rush among opportunity seekers eager to earn a living by it.Thodore Maurisset's lithograph playfully imagined a time when vast crowds would wait in line to have their portrait taken. It pokes fun at the pandemonium caused by the daguerreotype's invention and chronicles the many ways entrepreneurs hoped to cash in on the craze, from selling supplies and equipment to giving lessons in how to perform photographic procedures.
The Crystal Palace, an exhibition hall in Hyde Park, London, was the site of the first international exposition in 1851. The exposition was a great success, attracting more than six million visitors during the five months that it was open to the public. The impressive structure, consisting of an intricate network of slender iron rods sustaining walls of glass, was built expressly for the exposition and was not intended to be permanent. The main body of the building was 1,848 feet (563 m) long and 408 feet (124 m) wide; the centraltranseptwas 108 feet (33 m) high. The Crystal Palace established an architectural standard for later international exhibitions, several of which were likewise housed in glass conservatories.John Jabez Edwin Mayall may have made this daguerreotype from the second tier in order to encompass the scale of the building. The full-grown tree in the image's center, which does not even reach the ceiling, gives a dramatic indication of just how large the building was. Animperial platesize, the daguerreotype was one of the largest ever made. Americandaguerreotypeswere larger than those made elsewhere; the American Mayall surely saw this grandiose building as warranting equally impressive treatment.
This large, two-handled drug jar has an exceptionally rare shape and bold design. It was produced for the pharmacy of the Sienese hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, whose emblem-a three-runged ladder (scala a pioli) surmounted by a cross-appears on both sides. This emblem refers to the hospital's location in front of the steps (scale) of the city's cathedral. The emblem is framed on one side by two birds, possibly peacocks, and on the other by two human-faced birds, or harpies, who were monsters believed to torment misers in the fifteenth century. The surface is also decorated with stylized leaves and dots, which resemble oak leaves and berries.The decoration is painted in a very thick, cobalt-blue impasto, often called relief blue because it was applied so thickly that it seems to stand out from the vessel's surface. The leafy shapes are outlined in, and scattered with, touches of manganese purple. Under each handle is a letterP, possibly intertwined with a backwardC,which may be the mark of the Florentine workshop of Piero di Mazeo.
Unaware that Louis-Jacques-Mand Daguerre, the inventor of the daguerreotype, vehemently disliked having his own portrait made, Charles Richard Meade traveled to Europe in 1848 to make a photograph that would show American audiences what Daguerre looked like. Daguerre politely refused Meade's request but invited him to stay for a visit at his home in Bry-sur-Marne, France. Through the coaxing of either Madame Daguerre or Daguerre's niece, Meade secured the sitting. Daguerre's reticence, however, is apparent; he looks a bit uneasy and anxious for the whole ordeal to be over.During that visit Meade made five portraits of Daguerre, which he later exhibited in the galleries that were part of the Meade Studios in New York. They attracted a great deal of attention from Americans, who had enthusiastically embraced the daguerreotype soon after its invention early in 1839. Becausedaguerreotypeswere unique objects, Meade made daguerreotype copies of the portraits that he judged to be popular with the art-buying public.
Acentaurturns around to face the heroHerakles, who attacks him from behind with a club. From either side a woman and an old man watch the conflict. The scene shown probably comes from the story of the rape ofDeianeira. Pretending to aid the couple on a journey, the centaurNessosattempted to carry off Herakles' wife Deianeira. The woman and old man are probably Deianeira and her father Oineus.The back of the vase depicts a scene from daily life. Four nude athletes train at several sports: three youths throw the javelin and the discus, and the youth at the right holds jumping weights. Athletic training was an essential part of a youth's education in ancient Greece.
Achilles and Ajax, two great heroes of theTrojan War, play a board game on this Athenianblack-figureamphora. Behind the table stands the goddessAthena. The scene of the warriors at leisure but with their armor at the ready might have taken place during a break in fighting the Trojan War.This depiction of Ajax and Achilles gaming was especially popular in Athenian art in the late 500s B.C.; over 150 surviving vases show the scene. Why was this image so popular  Some scholars have argued that it was politically motivated. They interpret this scene as a mythical parallel for the tyrant Peisistratos's return from exile, when he was able to regain power because the Athenian army was unprepared for battle. If so, then these vases would be anti-Peisistratid propaganda, alerting Athenians to the importance of vigilance by reminding them of the consequences of their recent failure.The back of the vase shows a warrior departing for battle, standing between two old men. This was a common scene on vases and, in this case, a subject loosely connected with the scene on the front of the vase.
This pilgrim flask, one of the rare porcelains produced in the Medici factory, is an example of the earliest porcelain made in Europe. By the late 1500s, maiolica wares had begun to decline in popularity among the affluent. In its place, soft-paste porcelain was invented, to satisfy consumers' demand for novelty and increasing passion for true porcelain from China.An exceptionally beautiful piece, the Getty Museum's flask is one of only about sixty remaining Medici porcelain pieces. It displays the finest qualities of the factory's production, including a translucent white body decorated with clear designs in underglaze blue.Flasks of this kind were fashioned after vessels used by pilgrims and travelers to carry drinking water. This piece would have served simply for display as the applied side loops, in the form of grotesque masks, would never have suspended the vessel from a pilgrim's shoulder. The arabesque patterns and stylized floral decoration--including rose, carnation, tulip, and palmette motifs--imitate Chinese porcelain as well as Turkish ceramic wares from around 1500.
Upon seeing the Temple of Jerusalem turned into a marketplace by moneychangers and traders in sacrificial animals, the whip-carrying Jesus bursts out in anger. With an animated composition laid out on diagonals, and monumental figures reeling, Bernardino Mei's canvas aptly portrays Christ's righteous fury.Mei borrowed the half-length figures and their unique, unidealized faces from Caravaggio's naturalistic followers. From the Baroque whirls of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture, he took the multiple twisting movements, then added a silvery light to harmonize the colors.Baroque artists often painted this subject because of its tumultuous action and intense emotion. Italians of the 1600s tended to interpret the theme as symbolic of the contemporary reform of the Catholic Church.
The golden apples of immortality grew in the mythological Garden of the Hesperides. On this Athenianred-figurelekythos, fournymphstend the trees, and the goddessArtemisapproaches in a chariot drawn by deer, accompanied by acentaur. Although the Garden frequently appears in Greek art in connection with the labors ofHerakles, it simply serves as an idyllic setting frequented by divinities on this lekythos. Gardens were a favorite theme in the work of several vase-painters in the late 400s B.C. The peaceful setting contrasted sharply with the grim reality of the ongoing war that Athens was fighting againstSpartaand her allies.The vase-painter attempted to create a sense of depth and landscape in the painting by adding faintly outlined rocks, such as those that partially hide Artemis and those supporting the Hesperids.
Peitho, the goddess of Persuasion, stands addressing a woman named Demonassa, who sits in a rocky landscape looking rather dejected. At the right, a small wingedEros, the god of love, places his hand on Demonassa's shoulder, which makes the subject of Persuasion's message clear. In Greek mythology,Aphrodite, the goddess of love, gave Demonassa to Phaon, a ferryman on the island of Lesbos, in return for a service he had done for the goddess.This cup provides an unusually good example of the division of labor among different artists in an Athenianred-figurepottery workshop. The Meidias Painter, the head of the workshop, drew the interior decoration on thiskylix. A second artist painted the exterior scenes of women conversing and adorning themselves. This second artist, who presumably worked in the shop of the Meidias Painter, was less skillful, or at least less careful, than the master. A third artist who specialized in painting ornament rather than figures probably painted the elaborate floral designs under the handles.
Eros, the winged god of love, kneels in front of a woman sitting on a rock and unfastens her sandal on this Athenianred-figurelekythos.Hermes, the messenger of the gods, identified by his kerykeion, andParis, shown as a young hunter, observe this scene from either side. Who is this woman  Certain elements of the scene, such as the sandal-loosening suggest that she isHelen, whose affair with Paris caused theTrojan War, whereas other elements, such as the presence of Hermes and the outdoor setting, suggest that the woman isAphrodite, the goddess of love. The artist appears to have blended theiconographyof two favorite scenes of the period around 400 B.C.: the judgment of Paris and the romance of Paris and Helen. This vase also shows several of the elaborations favored by vase-painters in this period: the use of a great deal of added white color and the addition ofgildingto enrich the vase's decoration.
Johann Friedrich Bttger, the first European to make hard-paste porcelain, developed red stoneware at the Meissen porcelain manufactory in 1708. One of the hardest ceramic materials ever produced, stoneware could be polished and engraved on a wheel. This vessel's form and smooth surface imitate the lidded cups of hardstone or carved ivory that Europeans admired and collected in the 1700s.
Throughout the 1700s, tea was made in concentrated form and was very strong and quite bitter. It was then diluted with hot water. Because tea was so expensive and precious, people mainly served from small teapots such as this one and often reused their tea leaves.Johann Friedrich Bttger, the first European to develop hard-paste porcelain, began producing red stoneware in 1708. For only twenty years, the Meissen porcelain manufactory produced this extremely hard material. This teapot's form, polished surface, and cast floral decoration imitate contemporary silver designs.
The owner may have used this small dish to serve condiments at the dinner table or just displayed it as a decorative item. The branch-like handle and feet made from a flowering twig complement the bowl's inventive form: a cupped, heart-shaped leaf. Suchnaturalisticforms echo Chinese scholars' porcelain brush rests. The floral theme continues around the outside in the painted decoration as birds, spurting fountains, and winged figures intermingle with twisting leafy branches. A fanciful scene of a wingedcupidholding a bulrush and seated astride a sea monster decorates the interior.
Characters from touring Italian theater groups known as thecommedia dell'arteinspired sculptors at the Meissenporcelainmanufactory from 1720 on. Beginning in theRenaissance, performances of various comedies by the professional actors'guild, orarte, had offered an entirely new form of entertainment, and this form of theater became increasingly popular in the 1700s.Commediacompanies traveled and performed throughout Western Europe; actors entertained their audiences with music, dancing, and acrobatics combined with dramatic stories told with improvised dialogue. Theater-loving Europeans collected porcelain examples of their favorite characters from thecommedia dell' arte, either singly or in groups, to ornament their dining tables and other areas of the home.This figure represents Beltrame di Milano, a wistful blind character from one of the more popular comedies. His theatrical pose and gesture enliven the unpainted porcelain.
Hand bells used for calling servants were traditionally made of silver or other metals in the 1700s. With the discovery of the recipe forporcelain, the Meissen porcelain manufactory became the first place in Europe to offer such objects to the consumer in porcelain.Decoration of early European porcelain often alluded to porcelain's Oriental origins. Two scenes of Chinese figures in imaginary settings decorate this bell. Scholars believe that these images are similar to the distinctive chinoiserie images designed by Johann Gregorius Hroldt, the chief decorator at the Meissen porcelain manufactory in the 1720s. He signed few pieces, but scholars have attributed many works to him based on his signed album of drawings, which still survives in Germany.
This vessel is really a  trick  pot. When wine is poured in at the base into a long funnel, the liquid does not spill out when the pot is righted, although there is no cover on the bottom. The wine pot copies a Chinese model in the form of a peach, a symbol of longevity in the Far East.The Meissen porcelain manufactory, where this wine pot was produced, was the first European factory to discover the recipe for making truehard-paste porcelain. The form of early vessels copied actual Chinese wares, while the painted decoration was based on fanciful chinoiseriemotifs. This pot depicts various imaginary scenes such as a tea ceremony and a goat herder.
These decorative vases included fifty-four different scenes filled with Chinese figures in various fantastic imaginary settings. Scholars believe that these images are similar to the distinctive chinoiserie images designed by Johann Gregorius Hroldt, the chief decorator in the 1720s at the Meissen porcelain manufactory. He signed few pieces, but scholars have attributed many works to him on the basis of a surviving signed album of drawings.These vases formed part of a garniture, a set of porcelain ornaments of various shapes that decorated the chimneypiece. Each of these vases is marked under the base with the monogramARforAugustusRex. Augustus the Strong was theElectorof Saxony and the king of Poland, who established a porcelain manufactory in the capital city of Dresden in the first decades of the 1700s. The factory later moved to the nearby town of Meissen.
Johann Gottlieb Kirchner produced the model for this life-size porcelain sculpture of a fox-looking a little guiltily around the chicken it is about to devour-as part of an extraordinary commission from Augustus the Strong, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, who envisioned a life-size porcelain menagerie for his Japanese Palace in Dresden. The Meissen Porcelain Manufactory had been operating for only twenty years when Augustus commissioned this series of porcelain animals to be rendered  in their natural sizes and colors.  The production of porcelain models of this size had never been attempted before in Europe.Some of the technical difficulties Kirchner encountered in fulfilling this commission are evident on this figure of a fox with a chicken. First, the large scale of the figure required a number of highly visible vent holes to prevent explosions in the kiln. Second, shrinkage during the firing process and strong downward pressure from the objects' own weight caused cracks of varying severity. Meissen craftsmen tried numerous ways to reduce cracking; though they were certainly very inventive, few methods worked. The cracks made a final firing with enamel colors impossible, since this would have shattered the already cracked figures. Some were painted in oil colors, which became dull and discolored. In most cases the paint was removed at a later date. Traces of paint can be seen inside the pricked ears of this fox. In many ways, the successful creation of this life-size fox with a chicken attests to the Meissen manufactory's diligent attempt to satisfy one of the richest and most powerful men of the time.
Measuring almost two feet in height, this life-size turkey was made as part of an extraordinary commission from Augustus the Strong, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, who envisioned a life-size porcelain menagerie for his Japanese Palace in Dresden. Though he had already amassed an unrivaled collection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain, Augustus wanted these new figures to be produced by his own factory at Meissen. When Augustus placed the order for these porcelain animals, the Meissen factory was still of very limited experience, having only discovered the formula forhard-paste porcelainabout twenty years prior. The figure was modeled by Johan Joachim Kndler, a sculptor who was hired by the manufactory in 1731 to assist with the commission for the animalsProducing such large figures presented a number of challenges for Kndler and the Meissen craftsmen. The clay's thickness and weight and uneven shrinking frequently caused the animals to crack and collapse in the kiln. This turkey, along with all other sculptures for Augustus, was originally meant to be painted in the animal's natural colors; however, doing so proved technically impossible. Despite these difficulties, the figures stand as important examples of an early and experimental aspect of ceramic art.
Potters at the Meissenporcelainmanufactory imitated the shape and decoration of Chinese porcelain when they made these vases. The form copies a traditional Chinese design known today as a ginger jar, with flat shoulders and a wide, curving base. The bold flower decorations of rocks, birds, and blossoms, known at Meissen asIndianische Blumen(East Indies flowers), were a European interpretation of more delicate Chinese and Japanese ornament. The termIndianische Blumenderives from the name of the largest European importer of Asian ceramics in the 1700s, the Dutch East India Company.
Elaborately decorated with multi-colored panels of landscape scenes, this ewer and basin combine influences from a variety of sources. The ewer's helmet shape copies a metalwork form, while the flowers decorating the stem and handle derive from Japanese ceramics.The painted scenes are attributed to Christian Friedrich Herold, who began working at the Meissen Porcelain Manufactory in 1726. He became a prominent painter there, specializing in landscapes. Both the ewer and basin are decorated with landscape and harbor scenes containing figures in contemporary European dress.
An entry dated20th November 1745in the workbook of Johann Kndler, the Meissen porcelain manufactory's chief modeler, describes the model for this piece:  A large Japanese group, with a pagod [man] seated on a green bank, next to him a Japanese woman who holds a sunshade over his head, close to him a parrot, which he feeds.  One of only two known examples, this brightly colored porcelain group is characteristic of the whimsical European view of Asia in the 1700s. The exoticism of the Far East fired the imaginations of European craftsmen, who mixed elements of Japanese and Chinese style to create a new type of decoration known aschinoiserie.Here  Japanese  figures wear robes decorated with fancifully drawnIndianische Blumen(East Indies flowers) and carry an ornate parasol decorated with a dragon.
The clock's swirling leaves and asymmetrical overall design are typical of the work of Juste-Aurle Meissonnier, a designer and goldsmith and one of the leading exponents of the Rococo style. In an engraved book of Meissonnier's works, published about 1750, the antechamber wall in a cross-section of a house features a large clock with a reclining figure below the dial positioned like that on the Getty Museum's clock.Such clocks, also known aspendules d'alcove(alcove clocks), were usually small, suitable for hanging in an alcove above a bed. The repeating mechanisms that chimed the nearest hour and quarter hour when a string was pulled eliminated the need to light a candle to see the dial. They also prevented the constant chiming that would awaken a sleeper. This is the largest known example of thependule d'alcove,indicating that it was made for an extremely imposing interior.The figures on this clock represent Love conquering Time, a theme often repeated on mid-eighteenth century French clocks. The two cherubs above carry away the scythe and hourglass, the symbols of Time, while Time himself lies vanquished below with his globe, protractor, and pair of compasses.
The stern-faced man looking slightly off to his right with noble bearing strikes the viewer with his forthrightness and candor. The deep crow's feet, creased forehead, and sagging skin suggest a mature age, while his modest, short-cropped hair and the lack of ornamentation speak of a stoic conservatism.  Above all, the representation establishes the sitter's moral authority. The distinctive mole at the corner of the left eye suggests that the subject is Cicero, the famous Roman orator, statesman, lawyer, and poet. According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Cicero's name derived from a description of the mole in Latin ascicer,or chickpea, a feature of the subject which became standard inRenaissancedepictions.German Renaissance sculptor Conrat Meit carved theHead of a Manin emulation ofbustsfrom the Roman Republican period; this period favored a stark style with unmarked eyeballs and forward-combed hair. The starfish pattern on the back of the head is also typical of ancient busts. This kind of bust, which has been reset on a modern support, would have probably decorated the interior of a noble residence.
On one side of the neck of this krater,Adonis, a god of vegetation, reclines on a couch betweenAphrodite, the goddess of love, andPersephone, the queen of the underworld, and their female attendants. According to myth, Aphrodite fell in love with the beautiful mortal youth Adonis. Shortly after, he was killed in a hunting accident. Aphrodite was so distraught thatZeus, the king of the gods, made Adonis immortal, allowing him to leaveHades, the underworld of the dead, for part of the year to be with Aphrodite. He always, however, had to return to Hades, where he was Persephone's lover. This cycle of death and rebirth was linked with the regeneration of vegetation and the crop seasons in ancient Greece. Originating in theNear East, the cult of Adonis was introduced to Athens in about 440 B.C.; its devotees were exclusively female.The other side of the krater's neck shows a scene from asymposium, or drinking party, in which three male couples recline on couches. On the sides of the stand, a scene ofDionysosreclining with attendants mirrors the scene with Adonis above. A hunt scene with real and mythological animals covers the top of the stand.The form of this monumental vase, a volute-krater resting on a separately made stand, is exceptional. The combination of ribbing on the body of the vase andred-figuredecoration is quite rare in Athenian pottery. Indeed, many aspects of this vase are more typical of the Greek colonies in South Italy than in Athens, perhaps indicating that this vase was meant to look South Italian or even made for export to that area.
Before an altar with a crown on a large cushion, Queen Isabella the Catholic kneels in silent prayer. She kneels atop an ornate bracket with an empty escutcheon and a large crown in the center, flanked by various emblems and trophies including pomegranates, flags, suits of armor, and two nude men.The study gives enough careful detail to allow a stone carver to accurately reproduce this proposed design for a polychrome marble statue of the Spanish queen. The calibrations, numbered one to six along the right side of the sheet, would have allowed another craftsman to judge the scale of the work. The careful shading down the right edge of the bracket and around the emblems that hang from it suggests that these areas should project further forward than the top portion of the design. The rectangular frame around the queen represents a shallow niche.Pedro de Mena y Medrano produced the design for a statue for the main chapel of the cathedral of Granada. A pendant statue portrays Isabella's husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon, who kneels opposite her. So popular were the two statues that they were copied for another cathedral, in Mlaga.
William Burton Conyngham, a young Irish aristocrat, likely commissioned this pastel portrait as a souvenir of his Grand Tour. Though Conyngham is depicted as a distinguished gentleman, his open and eager expression conveys a sense of spontaneity appropriate to his youth. The artist, Anton Raphael Mengs, was renowned for his ability to achieve in pastels the effect of the strong saturated colors and highlights characteristic of oil painting. This is evident in the luxurious velvet cloak, which is cut off at the picture's edge to emphasize its volume and richness. The light reflecting on Conyngham's nose and lips and the wet appearance of the eyes further mimics the effect of oil paint.
This milky-white bowl with a pierced lid was probably used to hold potpourri, which was common in elegant homes of the 1700s. Decorated with elaborate sculpted basketwork, numerous carefully overlapping leaves, and colorful flowers, this bowl is an example of the highly sophisticated wares produced by craftsmen at the Mennecy Porcelain Manufactory. As an added amusement, the designers painted a caterpillar and leaves on the bottom of the bowl's interior.This bowl comes from the large and important collection of Lady Charlotte Schreiber, a noted collector of European porcelain. She bought it from a dealer in the town of Versailles, France, and recorded the purchase in her journal on February 17, 1870:  We had intended to go and look at the skating, but the time was too short, and we confined ourselves to the shops. . . . close by the omnibus terminus, we found a very fine Mennecy basket and cover with colored flowers in relief . . . 
Made ofsoft-paste porcelain, this largebustwas probably fired in the kilns of Mennecy, which were only 22.5 centimeters high. As this sculpture is 42.5 centimeters tall, the king's bust had to be fired separately from the base and then joined together above the crown. The king's head sunk slightly in the kiln, giving him a rather raised ribcage.Louis XVappears at the height of his powers, at about the age of forty. The bust was probably inspired by a marble sculpture by Jacques-Franois-Joseph Sally, which was erected in the town of Valenciennes in 1752. The decorations on theplinthinclude thearmsof France beneath the crown surrounded by swords, a cannon, drums, and battle standards.
This figure probably once formed part of a series of figures of various street vendors. He holds out an apron displaying a fish, grapes, a slice of melon, and two cucumbers. After buying fish, fruits, or vegetables at market, these vendors walked through the streets of the towns, advertising their wares with shouts or songs. The modeler at the Mennecyporcelainmanufactory may have copied this figure from one of many engraved series of  Cries of Paris  depicting such hawkers. There were so many hawkers, forming a potentially powerful group, that the king allowed them special privileges, including free entry to certain theatrical performances.This idealized view of a peasant with his sturdy clogs, short jacket, and apron appealed to wealthy patrons, who ordered large numbers of these figures. Designers created such small sculptures to be seen from all sides as table decorations.
In 1872 Adolf von Menzel spent several weeks in the vast smelting works in Knigshtte, Upper Silesia, watching and recording German workers go about the hot, gritty work of iron production. While there he produced numerous studies for his paintingThe Iron Rolling Millof 1875, which was one of the first depictions of the modern industrial worker. The careful modeling and detailing suggest that Menzel composed this drawing not on the spot but after some reflection.Both the shifting, fractured quality of the shadows and the roughness of the carpenter's pencil enhance the sense of the worker's heavy, physical labor. The large size and powerful stance of the figure might reflect Menzel's view of the worker as an almost mythical hero, integral to the advancement and progress of modern society.This drawing and the final painting were applauded for capturing the spirit of the age: the German people's national pride and excitement as their homeland's economy began its shift from agriculture to industry. Within a single generation Germany would become a powerful industrial state, generating wealth from coal and iron and factory production.
Madame Louise of France, the eighth daughter of the French King Louis XV, probably drank from this bowl. Known as ancuelle,it would have heldbouillon--a light, nourishing broth taken as a snack between meals. Madame Louise's monogramMLand the coat of arms of an unmarried royal princess are painted on the lid and dish.Lidded bowls with accompanying dishes were produced in large numbers at the Vincennes and Svres Porcelain Manufactory in a variety of shapes, sizes, and decorative schemes. Royal coats of arms rarely appear on Svres porcelain, and monograms are almost as uncommon, except on certain dinner services.
Known as a  skeleton clock  because of its exposed movement, this type of timepiece became popular at the end of the 1700s. Collectors appreciated the movement as an object of beauty, to be enjoyed as much as the case, which would formerly have hidden the elegant enameled dials.Besides telling the time with the large dial, the lower dials indicate the days of the week and the days of the month. Above, a fourth dial records the phases of the moon.
The Vexed Manis one of a series of 69 portrait busts or  character heads  made by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, an eighteenth-century German sculptor active in Austria. Messerschmidt sculpted them during the last thirteen years of his life, while apparently suffering from mental illness.This bust portrays a middle-aged man with a sour expression, which seems to fall somewhere between a grimace and a scowl. The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.This bust and the series it belongs to reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia. A contemporary wrote that Messerschmidt told him that by making the character heads, he hoped to ward away spirits that invaded his mind.
Ray Metzker is best known for hisComposites, images stemming from his insight that a single work could be created from an entire roll of film. The works function on multiple levels. From a distance, they read as abstract, graphic tapestries. Close viewing reveals them to be composed of a series of individual  documentary  vignettes, which can be read both simultaneously and sequentially. These works hold an important status in the history of creative photography: at the time of their making, they were unprecedented in ambition and perceptual complexity.
In many cases I thought of people being on a stage--the darks serving as a muted background. InCity Whispersthe blacks take on a different meaning.... There is a change in scale and an increased fragmentation of figures. Now black has a more ominous role: figures are either emerging or being swallowed.-Ray K. Metzker, in conversation with Nathalie Herschdorfer,Light LinesWith hisCity Whispersseries, Ray Metzker took a relatively simple technical approach, returning to the familiar terrain of the streets of Philadelphia and Chicago that he had photographed years earlier. At once tough and graceful, these images are dominated by engulfing shadows and a sense of isolation and fragmentation. They represent the culmination of an artistic vision that merges the realities of modern life with the intrinsic expressive possibilities of the photographic medium.
While drawing on a centuries-old tradition, Constantin Meunier fashioned a strikingly modern portrait ofChrist. As in images dating from the Middle Ages, Christ has long hair parted in the center and a beard and moustache, and his sunken cheeks make him appear gaunt. These wide eyes and the intense expression evoke the pathos of tradition devotional images of Christ being led to his death, mocked, scourged, and finally crucified.Meunier's loose, sketch-like handling of the bronze, however, is thoroughly modern, reminiscent of Auguste Rodin's manner. To suggest the horizontal arms of the cross, Meunier extended the shoulders out to the sides; he also detached at the wrist the left hand that crosses the chest, leaving it as a particularly evocative fragment. The bust's truncation is similarly radical, with a jagged, cut-off edge ending in a massive, irregular base. Artists in the 1800s came to use this kind of jagged truncation as a symbol for the alienated artist. Here Meunier applied the symbolic content of the jagged cut to a traditional religious representation, expressing the idea that Christ was cast out by those whom he would redeem.
The fine rendering in this watercolor by Hendrik Meyer underscores his subject: an idealized version of summer in the Dutch countryside. In theforeground, a tree and a shepherd tending sheep are cast in deep shadow. Their silhouettes draw attention to a brightly lit mill house in which every brick, piece of wood, and blade of straw is visible. Beyond the mill an ivy-covered steeple, a field, and a village are, by contrast, much more pale to establish atmospheric distance. Other details suggest the summer heat: Women are barefoot, a dog drinks water from the mill's stream, and cattle gravitate toward the shade. Much of the scene is animated: Men tend to animals or reap hay; womenwash, spin wool, and chatter; animals wander about; birds soar above, and a frothy waterfall spills from the mill.Meyer's figured landscapes were produced as finished works for sale. They revived a seventeenth-century tradition of such scenes, hearkening back to Dutch painters such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder, as well as calendar illustrations in medievalbooks of hours. Artists represented times of the year by showing people engaged in seasonal activities. Summer months were often represented by peasants harvesting fields, carrying hay, and guiding oxen.
Hendrik Meyer illustrated the subject of this watercolor--an idealized version of winter in a Dutch village--in great detail. A barren tree rendered in crisp lines and white highlights, dominates the foreground. The sky is filled with gray clouds, smoke pours from a cottage chimney, and a nearby stream is frozen over. A partially submerged rowboat is covered with snow and ice. Despite the frigid weather, people are outside, keeping warm with activities such as chopping and gathering wood, sledding, and ice-skating. Other elements in the scene also suggest movement: a windmill, chimney smoke, and birds circling or flying in formation. The landscape is filled with delicate textures: grass peeking through snow, a thatched roof, and skaters' trails on ice.Meyer's figured landscapes were produced as finished works for sale. They revived a seventeenth-century tradition of such scenes, hearkening back to Dutch painters such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder, as well as calendar illustrations in medieval books of hours.

In the early 1760s, directed by themarchands-merciers,artisans began to make small round worktables; these items became popular, as they could easily be moved around a room for multiple uses. Theporcelaintop, which could withstand heated vessels without damage, was ideal for serving tea or coffee. Some tables were even sold with porcelain tea services that matched the decoration of the top.Themarchands-merciersor dealers were the first to use Svres porcelain plaques in furniture. Creating a worktable such as this one was a complicated process involving many stages. First the dealer commissioned a design and ordered plaques from the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. He then selected anbnisteto make andveneerthe carcass of the table, leaving space for the plaques; a variety of craftsmen also had to design and makegiltbronzemounts. Another specialized worker lined the drawers with silk. Finally thebnisteassembled the table and returned it to the dealer to be sold.
Although Michelangelo Buonarroti used the theme of the Madonna and Child many times during his life, here he chose to represent a variant of the motif, one not specifically related in the Bible but commonly depicted by artists in the 1400s and 1500s. The infant Saint John the Baptist and two angels join the Holy Family on an interlude in their flight into Egypt to escape Herod's massacre of Jewish male newborns. To the right, a lightly drawn donkey grazes; the angels are barely discernible at the top left. The focus of attention, however, is the central group of the Virgin and the two children.Michelangelo achieved a solid, sculptural effect by using a combination of different media drawn on top of each other: underdrawing with a stylus, black and then red chalk, followed by pen and brown ink. Finely modulated hatching and cross-hatching enhances the figures' sense of three-dimensionality. Changes reflecting Michelangelo's creative working methods are visible in the head of the Virgin, which is positioned simultaneously looking downwards to the left and upwards to the right.
At the bottom left, a well-dressed donor looks up at the Virgin and Child above. He may be Michele Guinigi, who pledged himself to marry Caterina Buonvisi. Caterina may be featured in the guise of Saint Catherine, shown on the right with her broken wheel, the symbol of her martyrdom. The painting may, in fact, have been a gift celebrating the marriage between Guinigi and Buonvisi, both from prominent Italian families. The families'coats of armsare shown on the Madonna's throne.All attention in the painting focuses on the Virgin nursing the robust infantChristin the center. To the left,Saint Jeromebows his head in prayer.This picture, formerly in the Lathrop collection in New York, was the linchpin for the reattribution of a group of works to a follower of Filippino Lippi. This obscure painter has recently been identified as Michelangelo di Pietro Membrini.
Francesco Paolo Michetti chose to title this drawingScherzoto reflect the intention behind his self-portrait. To express the idea of ascherzo, a sprightly musical composition or movement, Michetti applied his materials in a quick, gestural manner that conjures up the music's darting, skipping rhythms. The brilliance of Michetti's color, particularly the halo of white around his face, also evokes thescherzo's liveliness. During the later 1800s, many artists believed in a concept known assynesthesia: that color and sound were so closely related that color could stimulate the sensation of sound and sound could stimulate the sensation of color.At age twenty-six, in the same year that one of his pictures received great public acclaim, Michetti drew multiple self-portraits. His direct gaze, the proud angle of his head, and the bravura handling convey his self-confidence.
Images depicting the allegory of art were traditionally used to classify painting as one of the liberal arts. A woman, usually idealized, personifiesPictura(Painting) and holds objects vital to artistic creation. In her left hand she holds a palette, brushes, and a small plaster sculpture that served as a model for larger works. Around her neck she wears a mask on a chain, which may refer to art's ability to deceive through the art of illusion.Frans van Mieris the Elder adopted the antique model ofPicturabut updated it for his time. The model is not classically beautiful or idealized; she is an average young woman observed from everyday Dutch life.Van Mieris the Elder was Gerrit Dou's most promising student in the school offijnschilders(fine painters) in Leiden in the 1600s. The highly finished quality of this painting is an excellent example of this style of painting.
In theforegroundof this minutely detailed painting, a maid attempts to revive an elegant young woman who has fainted. In thebackground, a doctor examines a vial of the woman's urine. The dandyish doctor, whose ostentatious clothing suggests that he is a quack, was a stock figure in contemporary theater, and his inclusion here adds a touch of bufoonery. An erotic painting hangs above the fireplace, hinting that the woman suffers from lovesickness. A crying girl seen in the right background holds a burning ribbon, which was understood at the time as a symbol of pregnancy.Frans van Mieris the Elder was well known for his finely painted works andgenrepictures like this one. He often presented a theatrical and humorous view of daily life among the prosperous Dutch.
Using black chalk, Nicholas Mignard modeled the solid proportions of this figure and the sculptural qualities of his garments, adding discrete touches of white chalk forhighlights. He made thissquareddrawing of the vain, imperious-looking monarch as apreparatory studyfor the figure of Midas in a painting. According to Greek and Roman legend, King Midas was known for his greed and his foolishness.
Standing on the right, a kidnapper firmly grasps the arm of a young girl while an armored knight tries to hand over precious jewels. In this theatrical painting, John Everett Millais depicted a sixteenth-century scene of a father paying ransom for his two daughters.The subject matter and technique are typical of the Pre-Raphaelite movement founded by Millais. Although he wanted to express a moral seriousness in his work, the drama is unconvincing: the figures are stiff and too large for the room they inhabit.The Ransomreceived criticism of this kind when it was exhibited, but no one could find fault with Millais's painting technique. The sharp, near-photographic rendering of objects, materials, and individuals display Millais's technical brilliance.Millais's painting was a group effort of sorts. His mother made and designed the costumes, his friend Mr. Miller posed for the head of the knight and he drew the body from a gigantic railway guard named  Strong.  The girls were painted from one model, Miss Helen Petrie, and Major McBean posed as one of the kidnappers. The artist, however, did not much care for the painting and referred to it as  the picture with the dreadful blue-and-white page in the corner. 
During her three-year marriage to a wealthy Egyptian, Lee Miller lived in Cairo, where she explored new directions in her photography. Prior to living in Egypt, Miller's images were largely limited to fashion and advertising subjects. Once in Cairo, however, she concentrated on still lifes and the landscape. This image of a desert landscape seen through the torn screen of a tent embodies Surrealist impulses Miller acquired early in her career, while working with Man Ray. The view contrasts interior and exterior worlds much as the Surrealists contrasted the worlds of the unconscious and the conscious.
 The love of death which is the under-pattern of the German living caught up with the high officials of the regime and they gave a great party, toasted death and Hitler and poisoned themselves. -- Lee MillerLee Miller captured this scene: Three people lying dead in a dust-strewn office at the close of World War II. Leipzig, Germany's mayor, his wife, and daughter killed themselves fearing reprisals from the Allied troops who stormed the city. Miller's strong flash illuminating the bodies from above, as well as a desk in theforeground. Light only barely reaches the back of the room, where a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler leans against a doorjamb, receding into the darkness. Lee Miller's Surrealist influence is evident here in the photograph's dreamlike quality. At first glance, the three figures appear to be sleeping. Their bodies slump gently onto furniture.Miller was one of the first photojournalists to enter Germany with the Allies. Her photographs and words from the war were made forVoguemagazine, for which she had been shooting fashion spreads just one year earlier, although they were rarely published. The war, according to her son, Antony Penrose,  gave her a clarity of purpose which focussed [sic] her whole life ... to shape a world based on the principles of justice and truth and compassion. 
Before Jean-Franois Millet achieved international success as a painter of peasant life, he earned his early living as a portraitist. Here, he depicted Louise-Antoinette Feuardent, the wife of his lifelong friend Flix-Bienaim Feuardent, a clerk in the library at Cherbourg. In this portrait painted shortly after her marriage, Louise-Antoinette prominently displays her wedding band on her left hand. In a style reminiscent of seventeenth-century Dutch painters, Millet painted the modestly dressed sitter against a plainbackgroundusing a limitedpalette. Louise-Antoinette looks out of the picture, her brown eyes calmly assessing the viewer. Through a tightly controlledcompositionand a careful balance of monochromatic tones, Millet captured Louise-Antoinette's self-containment, reserve, and poised composure.
Moonlight shines through an open window, illuminating a bedroom. A black cat with glowing eyes enters and looks toward a startled man who pokes his head through the bed curtains. His shoes lie on the floor in front of the bed, and his clothes are on a chair where he left them.This drawing illustrates  The Cat Who Became a Woman,  a fable by the seventeenth-century French writer Jean de La Fontaine. According to the story, a man becomes infatuated with his cat and convinces Destiny to change her into a woman. He marries her, but on their first night together she springs from the marriage bed to chase a mouse across the bedroom floor. The fable's moral is  The truth will out : no matter how much one's outward appearance changes, one's essential character remains.In a wealth of tones hidden in deep shadows, Jean-Franois Millet evoked the story's haunting mystery.
Sometimes, in places where the land is sterile, you see figures hoeing and digging. From time to time one raises himself and straightens his back, ...wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. 'Thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of thy brow.' Is this the gay, jovial work some people would have us believe in  But nevertheless, to me it is true humanity and great poetry.Thus wrote Jean-Franois Millet about his favorite subject, agricultural laborers. Despite his philosophical intentions, these subjects earned him accusations of Socialist leanings. When he exhibitedMan with a Hoeat theSalonof 1862, it quickly became one of the most controversial pictures of mid-1800s France. He probably made this drawing as apreparatory studyfor that painting, now also in the Getty Museum.In this drawing, Millet concentrated on the man, showing his face as less brutish, less exhausted, and more defined than in the finished painting. He used subtle additions of white chalk to render the clouds in the sky and the sun'shighlightson the farmer's shirt. Drawn on buff paper, the entire scene has a soft, hazy quality achieved with a technique known as stumping.
 [A]s I have never seen anything but fields since I was born, I try to say as best I can what I saw and felt when I was at work,  wrote Jean-Franois Millet. At theSalonof 1863,Man with a Hoecaused a storm of controversy. The man in the picture was considered brutish and frightening by Parisian bourgeoisie. The Industrial Revolution had caused a steady exodus from French farms, andMan with a Hoewas interpreted as a socialist protest about the peasant's plight. Though his paintings were judged in political terms, Millet declared that he was neither a socialist nor an agitator.A religious fatalist, Millet believed that man was condemned to bear his burdens. This farmer is Everyman. His face is lit, yet composed of blots of color that give him no individuality. He is big and dirty and utterly exhausted by the backbreaking work of turning this rocky, thistle-ridden earth into a productive field like the one being worked in the distance. A tribute to dignity and courage in the face of a life of unremitting exertion,Man with a Hoewas long considered a symbol of the laboring class.
The gay side of life never shows itself to me. . . . The gayest thing I know is the calm, the silence, which is so sweet, either in the forest or in the cultivated land.Thus wrote Jean-Franois Millet. He conveyed calm and silence in this peaceful composition, which is anchored by a monumental peasant figure. A cloud has blotted out the sun, and the muted daylight conceals details while emphasizing the shepherdess, sheepdog, and flock as archetypes. The shepherdess and dog stand silhouetted against the sky and field, waiting patiently and with dignity in the timeless world of the peasant, which Millet sought to ennoble in his work.This pastel, possibly the earliest of at least four on this theme, relates to Millet's painting of the same name. He exhibited the painting, now in Paris's Muse d'Orsay, to great acclaim at the Salon of 1864.
Forming an invertedYwith his lean, nude body, a youth stands in an extremely stark pose that conveys the conflicting emotions of troubled adolescence. The exposed body and genitalia suggest defiance, yet he hides his head beneath his protectively closed arms, indicating shame and anguish. The emotions expressed through the figure's modeling and composition--despair, anxiety, and adolescent sexuality--are characteristic of Symbolist art, reflecting the recent interest in psychology and the unconscious as explored by such contemporary philosophers of the human condition as Sigmund Freud.The youth's tensed leg muscles and locked knees are a tour de force of marble carving. Indeed, George Minne challenged the marble material by thinning down the legs to such an extreme that they broke at the ankles and had to be repaired with pins. Despite the monumentality of the figure, the statue is only fourteen inches tall.
The Pythia, a virgin from the local village selected in ceremonies that established her asApollo'schoice, sits atop the sacred tripod as theDelphic oracle. To the left is theomphalos,the most sacred object at Delphi, regarded as the center of the earth. Aplinthon the right bears an inscription describing Apollo's conquest of Delphi with the Cretans, who became his first priests.The prophetess went to the tripod on the sacred seventh day of each month, the day of Apollo's birth, nine months of the year, to await the god's inspiration; her inspired utterances were later interpreted by a priest. The ancient Greeks considered the Delphic oracle--both Apollo's divine prophecy and the prophetess through whom it was spoken--the final authority on almost any matter, whether religious, political, or social.Camillo Miola merged academic andclassicaltraditions to construct his view of the classical past. He filled the canvas with seemingly archaeologically accurate costume, architecture, and furnishings and painted in a highly detailed style to create an ancient world that appears fully real.
As told in the Gospels, while Jesus hung on the cross, he turned to his mother saying,  Woman, behold your son,  and then entrusted her to the care of his disciple, John. This bronze relief represents that moment, with the Virgin Mary and John flanking Jesus on either side of the cross and a weeping Mary Magdalene kneeling at the base. The artist emphasized the Virgin's close relationship to Jesus through their interlocking gazes and mirrored gestures. Both are modeled with three-quarter profile heads, and the Virgin's open arms, expressing her acceptance of the event, mimic those of Jesus. In contrast, John and Mary Magdalen are in profile, and their more overtly dramatic gestures convey their tremendous grief.Francesco Mochi designed the clouds and figures with foreshortening to suggest depth, a strategy that is only apparent when the relief is seen from below, as the artist intended.Features such as the relief's elongated rectangular shape, large size, gilding, keyhole, and hinge indicate that it served as the door of a tabernacle on the high altar of a church. Priests stored consecrated hosts in locked tabernacles to prevent contamination.
Eyes puffy and squinting, nearly closed as if swollen shut, lips curled and slightly open, an unidentified man handing out pamphlets in Paris has been frozen in a split second of uncompromising reality. Lisette Model's unforgiving, almost cruel portrait exposes in him a shabbiness and ugliness that serves as a metaphor for society at its worst.Model frequently photographed greatly overweight subjects, as if to draw a parallel between the excesses of their lives and bodies. She mounted the print on a torn section of the society column of the newspaper, contrasting this gasping, sweaty man with the chronicles of the glamorous elite to emphasize her interest in the class struggle.
Lisette Model's portrait of a peanut vendor in the market in Nice is one of the most sympathetic portraits that she made. With his bright eyes engaging the camera and a slight smile warming his face, the unidentified street vendor holds a burlap sack filled with peanuts on his lap. His tanned, rough hands reach into the sack, cupping the peanuts as if he is both offering and displaying his goods. Emphasizing his working-class identity and his job as a vendor, Model mounted the print on a piece of the classified advertisement section of an English language newspaper, possibly done after Model moved to New York.
While visiting her family in Nice, a fashionable resort on the French Riviera, Lisette Model began a series of photographs of wealthy vacationers along the Promenade des Anglais and another series of photographs of the working classes in other parts of the city. This rear-view portrait of a circus performer is an unforgiving commentary on his generous proportions, exaggerated by Model's close cropping of the figure to fill the image's frame. The posts of the bench bisect him horizontally and vertically, dividing his body into neat sections of rounded pattern and texture. Identified only as a  Circus Man,  the subject's anonymity is secured: not even an eyelash peeks out from the smooth, blank side of his face.
Bowery old-timers claim her voice has had no match for power and ferocity since Maggie Cline used to stun with  Knock 'Em Down McCloskey. The uncredited text, referring to this photograph of the bar singer known as  Tillie,  accompanied a group of Lisette Model's photographs made at Sammy's Bar that were reproduced in the September 1944Harper's Bazaarmagazine. Taken from below and at a slight diagonal angle, the image captures the vitality and vibrancy of the performer belting it out on the stage at Sammy's, a local favorite in the Bowery district of New York, also visited by photographers Weegee and Diane Arbus. The angle from which the photograph was made also emphasizes the gleaming microphone, which seems to rise up to meet the challenge of projecting Tillie's already powerful voice.
A large man sits slumped on his chair, his head bent forward to his chest in slumber, his torn and stained shirt stretched to its limits across his belly. He leans on the chair back and nearby railing to support his weight, since his surprisingly small foot, barely longer than his pant cuff, appears inadequate for the balancing job. On the left, a baby's stroller suggests a domestic scene, its curved handle well within his grasp should he awaken to discover it there. The upside-down poster for theater entertainment and the graffiti-marked brick wall along Delancey Street, a working-class neighborhood in New York, frame the subject and hint at the world in which he lives.
Lisette Model's photographs of wealthy men and women are frequently unflattering and often brutal indictments of the pernicious excesses of privilege. This portrait of an unidentified woman walking down the street in New York is no exception. Her scowling face stands in glaring contrast to the finery of her garments, which seem to indicate a life of comfort and ease. Yet there is anything but ease in the exchange between the subject and the photographer who stood directly in front of her, almost blocking her on the street. As a sobering metaphor for the social ills of the nation, the image's close-up, unrelenting framing presents a visual paradox that describes and measures class and cultural distinctions.
Working every detail of the costume except for the mysteriously missing wig, the transvestite performer on the right in Lisette Model's photograph is a garish ode to showgirl chic. His milky, white chest and broad shoulders spill out over the top of the snug, strapless dress, exaggerating his false femininity. His stage partner struts in profile behind him on the left in fishnet stockings and plumed hat, lifting his skirts to flash some thigh. The shimmering curtain provides the perfect frame for their burlesque performance.One of the editors atHarper's Bazaarmagazine, where she worked as a photographer, encouraged Model to visit Hubert's Freak Museum and Flea Circus on Forty-second Street in New York. Always drawn to unconventional subjects, Model made several views of the performances, often emphasizing the eccentricities of the entertainers.
Oblivious to the photographer, this well-appointed couple at the San Francisco Opera looks intently ahead, off to the left side of the photograph. Unidentified and relentlessly observed, they are reduced to types. The man's slender, angular, and youthful face is juxtaposed with the woman's older, fleshier countenance. His pert, upturned nose is no match for her long, formidable snout, while his crisp, white shirt and bow tie are a dramatic contrast to her dark, velvety folds. One white-gloved hand holds a cigarette aloft; the other clutches a beaded handbag. Lisette Model's camera with its harsh, flash lighting recorded every superb detail, from the goosebumps on her upper arm to the shadowy ear visible in the distance just below his chin.
This photograph was made on assignment forHarper's Bazaarmagazine. Lisette Model was assigned to photograph the women who resided at dude ranches in Nevada for the six weeks required to qualify for residency and obtain a quick divorce.The divorce seen here, wearing an embroidered Western-style shirt, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses in the blinding hot Nevada sun, erects a barrier between herself and the photographer. Her right hand and half-smoked cigarette prevent the camera from getting too close, as do the elaborate rhinestone-encrusted glasses that reflect stark windows and not much else. The circumstances of her stay in Reno lend an air of desperation to her defensive comportment.
With water streaming almost obscenely from its mouth, this female headed fountain in Rome presents an uninviting image. The foul, dark staining from the water seepage just below the mouth makes the head appear as though it has been ravaged by an unknown illness. Its wide, round eyes stare out as if in horror at some scene out of the camera's range. Likewise, the fountain's crumbling surfaces wear unsettling textures, exposing the ravages of time and the elements upon the once-pristine monument. Lisette Model photographed the fountain up close in order to focus on the decay and ruin that lend the picture a distinct sense of foreboding.
Tina Modotti believed that photography had the potential to transform ordinary things into symbolic objects. Photographed at close proximity, this luminous pair of Easter lily and bud take on a sculptural quality. The subtle tonal variations of the platinum print convey the flower's and bud's distinct, tactile qualities. As the viewer's eyes move upward, the flower's dark stem gives way to smooth, light petals that bend back gracefully, becoming translucent at the tips. The closed bud, however, displays the slightly irregular texture of the petals, and, unlike the open flower, appears darkest at the tips. For Modotti, who described nature as innocent, mysterious, and erotic, the contrast between the open, light flower and the closed, dark bud may have symbolized her own emotional state.
   . . . the emptiness of the house is terrible . . . I had the illusion that you had just gone to town and would be back in a little while--only for moments the truth flashed through my mind and then the pain and loneliness almost choked me . . . Tina Modotti revealed these feelings to her former lover, Edward Weston, after his permanent departure from their home. The statement, like her portrait,No. 3, makes clear her sense of abandonment. This series of open doors inside the Mexico City flat they had shared creates a study of surfaces, spatial depth, grids, and angles. Devoid of any personal effects, the portrait appears empty, surely reflecting Modotti's mood at the time.
The worker's worn, dusty hands rest upon the handle of his tool, against a backdrop of his soiled work clothes. Although shown here in repose, the hands are a powerful symbol of a life of hard manual labor. The worker paused here for Tina Modotti's camera, not letting go of the tool and thus suggesting an imminent resumption of work. Modotti, a devoted Communist, was sympathetic to the plight of the laborer in her adopted Mexico, and her photograph serves as an anonymous but respectful depiction of all those in the peasant class for whom survival is a daily struggle.
A Shunammite woman throws herself at the feet of theOld TestamentprophetElisha, begging his intervention to save her son. The son had collapsed in the fields and was seemingly dead. Elisha then went to the boy's room and performed his most remarkable miracle: he  lay on the child, put his mouth on his mouth. . . and the boy opened his eyes. Most representations of the subject show Elisha in direct contact with the child, but Claes Cornelisz. Moeyaert chose a more unusual moment in thenarrative. With subtle ingenuity, he underscored the broader moral implications of the story by simply presenting the woman's universal appeal for assistance. To heighten the emotional drama of the scene, she and Elisha appear in theforeground, shaded darker for emphasis, against a backdrop of less distinct yet attentive onlookers.
Lszl Moholy-Nagy created this abstract photogram by placing objects on light-sensitive paper and exposing them to light without the use of a camera. The title of this photogram refers to a mirror; the shapes in this composition may have been made using a circular looking glass and its reflections. The large size of the print, approximately two by three feet, suggests that Moholy-Nagy used an earlier photogram as a negative to make this enlargement, thus this image is a  mirror,  or reversal of the earlier composition. The shadow effects of the circular and angular forms energize the space, suggesting movement.
 The organization of light and shadow effects produce [sic] a new enrichment of visions,  wrote Lszl Moholy-Nagy in a caption for thisphotogram. Eliminating shapes reminiscent of nature and seeking to explore the relationships of light, color, or tone and nonobjective form, Moholy-Nagy  painted  this picture with light using the cameraless photogram technique. He transformed unidentifiable objects into abstract representations of light and form. The softly blurred edges of oval, circle, and line reverberate with luminosity, while the small burst of light at the lower right streaks through the rich black tone like a miniscule comet.
The overlapping circles in thisphotomontagesuggest the range finder of a rifle and also a rapid-fire simultaneity of events. A female sharpshooter at the center of the circles reinforces the metaphor of shooting. Standing outside of the circles, a female gymnast lifting weights is seemingly unaware of the gun trained at her chest. The repeatingvignettesof a railway station colonnade, to which the alternate title of the work,Murder on the Railway Line, refers, lend a sinister, almost cinematic air to the composition. Lszl Moholy-Nagy did not intend a specific narrative; he sought instead to excite intuitive rather than intellectual responses in his audience.
 A wealth of undreamt-of optical experiences that will be profoundly stirring to our emotions  is how Lszl Moholy-Nagy described hisfotoplastiks(photomontages). This entire composition resembles an opened parachute. From out of an aperture emerges a figure with flailing arms and crossed legs upon whom is superimposed a tribal person using a blowgun, his head located where the other figure's head should be. A child tumbles midway through the composition; a uniformed figure lands neatly in the sunflower-like fireman's net below. From his hands and feet three lines emerge, suggesting marionettes being manipulated by a higher power.
A floating circle, a commonmotifin Lszl Moholy-Nagy's work, is a dominant, repeated form in this composition: one superimposed over the face of a human figure, a second substituting for another body, and the final and largest circle serving as the foundation upon which the figure perches. The detailed opulence of the plumed skirt cascading around the woman's body contrasts with the empty void of the black sphere obliterating her face and thus her identity.The title refers to the identical twin Dolly Sisters, Jenny and Rosie, who were a dance team popular in Europe and the United States from 1911 to 1927. They appeared at the Moulin Rouge in Paris and the Ziegfeld Follies in New York, and spent their final years in Los Angeles. They were renowned for both their beauty and their gambling prowess.
A choppy sea of people attending a rally for the Factory Worker's Association in Berlin dissolves into a pattern of round faces and hats punctuated by banners and flags, transforming an unmanipulated, documentary-style photograph into a formal composition emphasizing aesthetics over reporting. Individual faces begin to emerge in the crowd, many smiling, some in dramatic profile seemingly going against the advancing human tide. This is an unusual image in Lszl Moholy-Nagy's work from this period and may have been taken to serve as source material for an exhibition design or a commercial project.
Here Lszl Moholy-Nagy transformed muddy water rushing into a street drain into a study of light and texture. A strip of fabric that diverts water into the drain becomes a slashing diagonal line in the upper center, while the drain itself is transformed into a perforated rectangle reflecting light from its shimmering, soaked surface. Water seemingly flows in every direction as the layers of water and ground are compressed into a two-dimensional space.This image was made during a summer visit to Paris, but Moholy Nagy's unique vision incorporated none of the Parisian landmarks or pictorial elements that dominated the work of most photographers in that city.
This photograph is a somewhat menacing, surreal image of two naked dolls, one of them missing its legs. They lie helpless upon their backs on a piece of paper, with the shadows of chicken-wire fencing dissecting their vulnerable bodies. Despite their predicament, Lszl Moholy-Nagy used them strategically as a design element that interrupts the bold graphic forms of intersecting lines. The dominant diamond pattern of the railing casts deep diagonal shadows across the balcony, flattening out the composition, while the photographer's tilted view of the balcony defies traditionalperspective, removing the space from associations with the real world.
Thisfotoplastik, as Lszl Moholy-Nagy called hisphotomontages, was the cover design for the prospectus of a large housing development on the outskirts of Berlin. Residents could rent with the option to buy their apartments and were promised space for a garden, which Moholy-Nagy represented in the profusion of flowers and plants dominating the picture. Maintaining that such montages were  grounded in that kind of cerebral and ocular gymnastics which most city dwellers are compelled to perform day by day,  Moholy-Nagy filled the frame with a claustrophobic overlapping of images of domesticity and elaborate manors and gardens intended to suggest the pleasures of home ownership. The actual development being advertised appears immediately above the man's left shoulder.
Also calledLight Prop for an Electric Stage, this kinetic sculpture that Lszl Moholy-Nagy designed and photographed was intended to create light displays for theater, dance, or other performance spaces. With its gleaming glass and metal surfaces of mobile perforated disks, a rotating glass spiral, and a sliding ball, theLight-Space Modulatorcreated the effect ofphotogramsin motion. As photographed here, the geometric complexity of the design and the shapes created by shadows and light convey the dynamic possibilities of both machine and camera.
On a white marble base, two Vestal Virgins tend a flame that honors the goddess of the hearth, Vesta. A drawing still exists that shows the clock was designed to sit on a mantelpiece, itsclassicaltheme a suitable reference to the fireplace below. The altar that houses the clock's movement is fitted with horizontal enameled and jeweled hour and minute rings, while a sacrificial procession underneath is shown in gilt bronze. A branch of roses draped over the edge of the altar points to the time.Henri-Franois Dubuisson made the clock's dials.
In Virgil'sAeneid,Iris, goddess of the rainbow that trails behind her faintly drawn in black chalk, comes to Turnus, leader of the Rutuli nation, as a messenger from Juno. Iris tells Turnus to attack Aeneas's invading army now, for Aeneas has left camp. Ultimately, however, Aeneas killed Turnus and founded a city, which became Rome. The black chalk study of a Roman helmet in the upper left probably relates to the verso sketch of groups of ancient Roman soldiers.Pier Francesco Mola displayed his distinctive talent for incorporating figures into lush, windswept landscapes that enhance the scene's drama. He usually mixed pen and chalk as he did here, first quickly laying down the composition's essentials using black chalk, then picking out the most important lines in pen and ink. His characteristic fluid dark washes increase the sense of movement and tension.Mola made this study for a fresco on the vault of a room in a prince's summer palace. After a dispute with the prince, Mola left the project unfinished and it was later destroyed.
During his devotions in the wilderness, Saint Bruno, the founder of the Carthusian order, amonasticcommunity committed to solitary meditation, experienced a vision. Gazing intensely up at the sky, the saint tentatively reaches out to touch the mystical illusion of angels appearing in the sky. To the left, two tall trees cross each other at an angle, forming a cross. Below the rolling clouds, hills and land gently recede into the distance.The painter Pier Francesco Mola won fame in Rome for his rich landscapes and dramatic cloud formations, based on the Venetian landscape tradition. He painted Saint Bruno's white robes with long, smooth vertical sweeps of the brush, creating a landscape of the soft, heavy fabric.
In the 1620s Pieter Molijn pioneered one of the innovations in Dutch landscape art by organizing acompositionon a diagonal. Thirty years later, he used thisdeviceto animate a procession crossing the lake in this drawing. The diagonal not only leads the eye into depth but also unifies the composition from left to right. To add variety and interest, Molijn intersected the line in the middle with a sleigh going its own way.Using Holland's low horizon line and barren winter landscape and a relatively small number of figures, Molijn created an intimate picture that suggests the isolation of figures in nature and the hard work demanded by surviving the cold winters.
When the roll-top is raised, a writing slide may be pulled forward, revealing dummy drawer fronts that match the interior desk drawers above. Additional writing slides pull out at the sides, perhaps for assistants to take dictation. The desk was originally designed to sit in the middle of a room, where it could be seen from all sides; the gilt bronze mounts that decorate the lowerfriezeonce continued around the back.ThebnisteBernard Molitor, who made this desk, received many commissions from the French court. Although scholars are unsure exactly who commissioned this grand piece, an entry in a sale catalogue of 1800, when it was sold at auction, described it as having come from the royal chteau of Saint-Cloud. A further clue to its original owner are the very small fleurs-de-lis, symbol of the monarchy, stamped on the drawer handle of the center drawer.
Carved, painted, andgildedwood paneling(boiserie)formed the main decoration of walls in important eighteenth-century rooms. This room was originally used as a bedroom or largecabinetin a private Parisian home at number 18 place Vendme. In its original state, half of the room was paneled: the pier-glass, the window surrounds, and the fireplace wall. The back wall, where the bed was placed, was hung with fabric.Not all of the paneling from this room has survived, but the present installation approximates the room's original configuration. Additional modern panels, discernible by their lack of gilding, replace the lost elements. The floor, though old, is not contemporary with the room.
This secrtaire is designed in a rigidly architectonic style composed ofclassicalelements such as columns,pilasters, and a cupola. The panel in the midsection lowers to reveal drawers and pigeonholes designed as small rooms, withparquetrywalls and floors in many different naturally colored woods. Concealed above the fall front is a reading stand; below are drawers that can be rotated outwards.The interior of the secrtaire where the wood has been protected from daylight is pale yellow. This means that the cabinet has darkened considerably over time; with its pale woodveneer, white marble plaques, andgilding, it would have seemed much less somber. The secrtaire once had a large musical movement inside its base, which played a tune when the clock struck the hour.
The twelve apostles gather at the center of this letterVand gaze up in amazement at Christ, who rises into heaven on a blue cloud. The upward sweeping motion of the colorful acanthus leaves that climb up the form of the letter reflects and enhances Christ's movement. While the figures' gestures and drapery are naturalistically portrayed, the scene is set against a highly polished gold background, which lends it an otherworldly feeling.This elaborate initial, which originally began the chant for the feast of the Ascension, came from a large gradual made for the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence, of which Lorenzo Monaco, the designer of this image, was a member. Zanobi di Benedetto Strozzi and Battista di Biagio Sanguini probably painted this initial more than a decade later.
Although painted in his studio, this still life shows the influence of the outdoor experiments that Claude Monet undertook in the summer and fall of 1869, while he was living at Bougival on the Seine River. His exercises in different painting techniques are seen in the way he softened the outlines of forms and the manner in which he explored the descriptive possibilities of brushstrokes: broad and flat in the tablecloth, sketchy in the apples, and short and dense in the flower petals. Monet's technique is also apparent in the use of light to animate the surfaces of the flowers, fruit, and tablecloth and in the way the colors are affected by the light, by reflections, and by each other. These pictorial innovations became the foundation for the development of the Impressionist technique in the decades that followed.
In the muted palette of the emerging dawn, Claude Monet portrayed the industrial port of Le Havre on the northern coast of France. The brilliant orange of the rising sun glimmers amid the damp air and dances on the gentle rippling water, lighting up its iridescent blues and greens. Barely discernible through a cool haze, pack boats on the left billow smoke from their stacks. Painted during the spring of 1873 as the country struggled to rebuild following theFranco-Prussian war, thisSunrisemight also metaphorically suggest a new day dawning in France.Sunriseexemplifies Monet'splein air, or  outdoor,  approach to painting. The informal and spontaneous brushstrokes establish this picture as one of the first works, along with the famousImpression: Sunriseat the Marmottan Museum in Paris, in the Impressionist style that was to make him famous. The ephemeral play of light, water, and air would remain Monet's subject for the rest of his career.
In the fall of 1890,ImpressionistClaude Monet arranged to have the wheatstacks near his home left out over the winter. By the following summer he had painted them at least thirty times, at different times throughout the seasons.Wheatstackswas Monet's first series and the first in which he concentrated on a single subject, differentiating pictures only by color, touch,composition, and lighting and weather conditions. He said,  For me a landscape hardly exists at all as a landscape, because its appearance is constantly changing; but it lives by virtue of its surroundings, the air and the light which vary continually. After beginning outdoors, Monet reworked each painting in his studio to create the color harmonies that unify each canvas. The pinks in the sky echo the snow's reflections, and the blues of the wheatstacks' shadows are found in the wintry light shining on the stacks, in the houses' roofs, and in the snowy earth. With raised, broken brushstrokes, Monet captured nuances of light and created a solid, geometric structure that prevents the surface from simply melting into blobs. The wheatstacks are solid forms, and, while the outlying houses are indecipherable close-up, they are clear from a distance.
 Everything changes, even stone.  Claude Monet wrote these words in a letter and vividly demonstrated them in paint, conveying a wondrous combination of permanence and mutability as the sun daily transformed the facade of Rouen Cathedral. Extending the building's encrusted stone surface to the richly varied impasto surface of his painting, he portrayed the cathedral perpetually re-emerging in the suffused light of early morning.Monet created several groups of paintings exploring the color, light, and form of a single subject at various times of day, but his Rouen Cathedral series was his most intense effort on a single site. He painted there in late winter in both 1892 and 1893, then reworked his thirty canvases from memory in the studio through 1894. He began this example in 1893, working in an improvised studio in the front room of a dressmaker's shop across from the cathedral.After creating a coherent ensemble, Monet selected twenty paintings that he considered  complete  and  perfect,  including this one, for an exhibition at his Paris dealer's gallery in May 1895. Pissarro and Czanne visited and praised the series, and patrons quickly purchased eight paintings from the group.
Beneath a cloudless sky, the bright Mediterranean sun transforms Civitavecchia, the port of Rome, into a diaphanous jewel. Beyond the strong horizontal of the harbor wall, buildings of varying heights create a dynamic skyline. On the darker, earthy outcropping in theforeground, a woman and child observe a small group of men and horses moving toward the Tyrrhenian Sea. The water is dotted with boats and its pale blue coloration reappears in the hazy green-blue mountains in the far distance.Most Dutch visitors to Italy arrived at Civitavecchia and the port was beloved by artist-travelers. This view is one of a small series of Italian cities, including Rome and Pisa, that Pieter Moninckx produced during the 1660s and 1670s. Like many Italianates, Moninckx worked both from nature and from his imagination, but the topographic accuracy of this scene suggests that it was made on the spot.
Surrounded by attendants and seated at a round table before a tiled, outdoor pavilion, the Chinese emperor and empress enjoy a light meal. While the imperial couple are served tea and fruit, a servant reaches up behind them to remove a platter from a buffet of golden dishes and blue-and-white porcelain arranged in the European fashion. Seated on a stool to the left, a female musician with a monkey at her feet plays a stringed instrument resembling a sitar. In the center, a dwarf dances to her music, while to the right a maid drops incense into a golden incense burner.A large carpet covers the platform on which the emperor and empress sit. The edge of the carpet is woven with the inscription of Guy-Louis Vernansal, who was the chief designer of the tapestry series known asThe Story of the Emperor of China.
In one tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, a woman standing at the left, possibly the Chinese empress, gestures with her fan toward the tropical bounty and beyond to the six-storied pagoda and other buildings in the distance. The tapestry's foreground shows a field of pineapples and other plants, including a palm and a tall banana tree.The first pineapple grown in France had been given to the King of France, Louis XIV, but the fruit was still rare in the early 1700s and its form was probably unknown to the Beauvais artists who wove the tapestry. They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.
The Offering toBacchus, which shows a decorated pavilion housing a white marble statue of Bacchus, is one of a series of six tapestries known as theGrotesquesseries. The light subject matter and whimsical decoration appealed to a wide range of purchasers, and theGrotesquesbecame one of the most popular sets produced by the Beauvais manufactory. For over forty years, wealthy patrons ordered hangings from the series.Not only the decorative subject matter, which contrasted with the more formal biblical and historical themes of other contemporary tapestry series, but also the flexibility of the design made it popular. Weavers could easily adapt the composition and change the dimensions to fit a specific location without losing the meaning of the design. The orange-brown color of the background, known astabac d'Espagne(Spanish tobacco), also became extremely fashionable, and a few individuals ordered matching furniture upholstery to complement this unusual shade.
As imagined by a French designer of luxury goods, who had probably never been to China, the wife of the Chinese emperor Shun Chi embarks on a pleasure boat ride. Three servants attend the empress, one of whom plays a portable keyboard instrument and sings. Other musicians, acrobats, dancing rats, and monkeys entertain her from the landing.Originally one of a popular, frequently woven set of ten tapestries, this particular subject,  The Empress Sailing,  was least common among the series. Only one other surviving example is known.Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, commissioned this specific tapestry as part of a set for his country residence outside Paris. Nine tapestries from his set are known to survive, each with borders of the same design, including his monogramLAin the four blue ovals of the border. The Getty Museum owns seven tapestries from this set.
A painting by Nicolas Poussin,The Triumph of Pan, inspired the figures in this square-shaped tapestry, which include dancing women with tambourines, a goat, and a statue of Pan--the Greek god of flocks and fertility. They symbolize the sort of revelry inspired by Pan and the wine god Bacchus, who were celebrated at lively feasts during antiquity.The three female dancers and a young jester perform on a checkered floor in a narrow space partially enclosed by a balustrade and potted fruit trees. The statue of Pan stands beneath an ornate canopy in the center of this arcade. Columns on either side of the statue support an architectural cornice adorned with floral bouquets and a peacock. A large eagle hovers directly above.Befitting the tapestry's theme of honoring Pan, the border features a recliningchinoiseriefigure imbibing a cup of wine. Scrolls, floral bouquets, exotic birds, and hybrid human figures complete the ornate border design.
By the late 1600s, exotic creatures like camels were familiar to the French, who knew of them from classical writers like Aristotle and Pliny and from accounts in medieval bestiaries. At least some of the beasts may have been drawn from life at the royal menagerie at Versailles.In addition to animals and birds--a camel, leopard, lion, peacock, and parrots--this tapestry features human figures. These theatrical performers wear half-masks, and were based on characters from a popular form of street theater, theCommedia Dell' Arte(Comedy of Art). On the tapestry's left side, a violinist and a tambourine player accompany a tightrope walker. On the right, a jesterlike figure tends to the camel. Between them, cherubs perform precariously from ropes hanging down from a central cornice, with a peacock perched below them. Above, parrots balance on canopies hung beneath two trellises and amidst an assortment of swags, urns, and other ornate elements.Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, who designed this tapestry, is best known as an artist of floral still-life paintings in the Dutch tradition. The enormous bouquet in the tapestry's center reflects his specialty-floral paintings produced for the court at Versailles.
Across an expansive field of golden orange, musicians perform on a stage filled with suspended, gravity-defying objects. This saturated background color-a novelty in the late 1600s-acts as a foil for the blue, green, and red elements, which are arranged with theatrical flair amid columns, trellises, and drapery.The musicians and dancers are based on characters from theCommedia Dell'Arte(Comedy of Art), a form of Italian burlesque theater performed by traveling troupes. In the street, the performers would act out standard plots with improvised dialogue. The figures here seem engrossed in dancing or playing their instruments: a triangle, panpipes, flute, guitar, and horn.The tapestry's border is an allegory of the five senses-taste, touch, sight, hearing, and smell. Recurring decorative motifs include floral bouquets, squirrels, parrots, satyrs, sphinxes, andchinoiseriefigures.
In a tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, the empress sits cross-legged on a large cushion beneath a small domed pavilion in the open air. A maid shields her from the sun with a parasol, while two others serve her fruit and tea. To the right, a square table holds a large metal ewer and a basket with various glass and blue-and-white porcelain vessels. Floral swags hang from the poles of the pavilion, and a circlet of flowers is suspended in the middle.
Wearing a crown and the Order of the Golden Fleece around his neck, Solomon kneels to worship a statue on the pedestal. Toward the end of his life, the king became increasingly obsessed with pagan cults, which contributed to the decline and finally to the division of his kingdom. In the 1500s, artists from Protestant countries used the subject of Solomon's idolatry to warn against the use of imagery in the Roman Catholic Church. The rich costumes, the lavish floor covering and carved pedestal, and the rare pet monkey in the corner all show that this room belongs to a noble individual. The large paintings hanging on the back wall show battle scenes, with soldiers proceeding along the roads in the distance. The flamboyant robes and feathered hats resemble those worn by courtiers from southern Germany in the early 1500s, which suggests that the artist came from this region.
The Monogrammist M.S. is known only from his signature on this drawing.A horse awaits at the right, while a falconer and his royal dog lure back the falcon, shown bent over his prey. Crisp black outlines with small hatchings represent light and shadow and give three-dimensional form to the land, trees, and figures. In an approach typical of the 1500s, layers, or strips of land that together build a sense of depth, show the recession from foreground to background. To emphasize the vast distance of the mountains and town in the background, the Monogrammist M.S. sketched in only the barest of outlines indicating the far-off trees with tiny ovals. The drawing's high level of finish and prominent monogram and date indicate that he may have made it as a gift for a friend.Hunting scenes of this type were extremely popular in German art of the 1500s. By the Middle Ages, falconry, the art of using birds of prey (falcons, hawks, and sometimes eagles) to hunt game, had become a favorite pastime of wealthy aristocrats in Western Europe.
In this tabletop bronze sculpture,Venus, the nude goddess of love, andMars, the god of war, tenderly embrace in a union of opposites. Although Hans Mont composed the statue with a dominant view of Venus from the front and Mars from the side, the complex entwining of the figures encourages the viewer to walk around them. Mont reveals the characters' personalities through the shapes of their bodies: Venus curves her elegant long limbs in an unfinished spiral around the more rectilinear posture of the muscular god of war. As is characteristic ofMannerism,naturalismis sacrificed for elegance ofcomposition: Venus' forearms and wrists bend illogically as she wraps her long arms around Mars. While the figures' bodies express their emotional intimacy, their faces remain surprisingly impassive. The sculptor's choice of theme, the small-scale format, and the artist's use of bronze show the interest of artists andpatronsin reviving the culture and art ofclassical antiquity, beginning in the 1400s.
The large panels of tortoiseshell, brass, and pewter that cover the front and sides of this secrtaire were originally used to decorate tabletops in the late 1600s. One tabletop forms the front, cut in half to allow for both the fall front and a cupboard door beneath. The fall front lets down to form a writing surface. The second top has been cut along its length and used to decorate both sides of the secrtaire.Furniture such as this secrtaire, made in the style now termed  Boulle revival,  usually either incorporated panels of late seventeenth-centurymarquetryby Andr-Charles Boulle or were conscious copies of works by that master. Boulle's work was still so popular a hundred years after his death that severalbnistes,including Philippe-Claude Montigny, produced furniture imitating his designs.Thegiltbronzemountsand the form of this piece are typical of the earlyNeoclassicalstyle known asgot grec,popular with fashionable society. Indeed, the secrtaire is described twice, in the sale catalogues of twocourtiersatVersailles, Monsieur de Billy and the comte de Vaudreuil.
Although willfully distorted, this large bronze form remains instantly identifiable as a seated woman. The figure's lower half has been reduced to a bulbous mass that rests atop a minimally articulated stool. The top half is more contorted, yet plainly recognizable as a female torso. The woman's head turns distractedly to one side and, though lacking in anatomical specificity, achieves a surprising degree of expression.The creation of this sculpture reveals the lengthy gestation period that sometimes accompanied Henry Moore's work. In the late 1950s, he made amaquetteor small plaster model of this seated figure. Once he had achieved the desired shape, one of Moore's studio assistants then carved a plaster mold of themaquetteto be sent to a foundry for casting in bronze. But Moore, unsatisfied with the large mold, chose not to have it cast and continued to refine the plaster. It remained in his studio for many years and was finally cast in 1975--more than two decades after the original design was conceived.
Composed of swelling masses, the reclining mother tenderly cradles her small child. Drapery largely conceals the massive figure's anatomy, but a clearly delineated arm forms a protective right angle around the stiff, inert baby. The mother's eyes--the only feature of her otherwise blank face--stare unblinkingly outward at the viewer. A rich, golden surface, punctuated by bright highlights and dark caverns, enhances the sculpture's warm, protective quality. The horizontal form's hollows and curves, tarnished and hatched to emphasize depth, partly transform the figure into a glimmering, rolling landscape.This work combines several themes that preoccupied Henry Moore: the reclining figure, the relationship of mother and child, and the landscape. Moore began exploring the reclining figure motif in a series of drawings he made in the late 1920s--nearly sixty years before creating this sculpture. Despite his continued interest in this subject, the sculptor resisted attaching any specific or symbolic meaning to it. Instead, he insisted that the reclining figure was simply a formal vessel--a pose he understood and greatly appreciated-- that allowed him to explore questions of form.
This immense bronze sculpture is more than fourteen feet high. Its title does not reveal a specific subject and the form can be seen as abstract--its golden, undulating surfaces glimmering in sunlight. But the sculpture's vertical orientation also evokes an upright human figure. The dramatic, curvilinear contours suggest that the sculptor had a female form in mind.The sculptor Henry Moore always insisted that his work relate to recognizable forms,  Purely abstract sculpture seems to me to be an activity that would be better fulfilled in another art such as architecture. . . . I have never been tempted to remain a purely abstract sculptor.  This sculpture had its origins in a group of drawings created by the artist almost fifty years earlier. In the mid-1930s, Moore made a series of sketches based on carved wood figures from the South Pacific. Around 1940, he began to transform this imagery into three-dimensions, creating a series of helmet-encased heads.Bronze Formis directly related to this theme and was completed only a year before the artist's death.
This photograph, depicting a large group of slaves, was taken by Henry P. Moore at Hilton Head, South Carolina on the seven-hundred-acre Fish Haul Plantation belonging to Thomas Fenwick Drayton. The plantation was largely dedicated to producing cotton, and fifty-two slaves worked and lived there. Moore's photographs from this period document slaves' living quarters and include images of workers ginning and sorting cotton. This image depicts slaves who were in the process of being freed by the federal government.
This man's armor reveals some information about him, though his name is unknown. Such a suit was designed for the  foot tourney,  a combat in which two men faced one another over a wooden barrier and struck each other with a prescribed number of blows from a pike or sword. The armor was probably made in southern Germany, but officers from Austria, Spain, and parts of Italy would have sought it out. Soldiers always wore their sword on the opposite side of its primary use; thus this man's rapier, hanging from his right side, demonstrates that he is left-handed.The artist may have adopted this three-quarter-length, three-quarter-view format from Titian, who introduced the composition in military portraits in the 1530s. As court painter to King Philip II of Spain, Mor painted many such portraits of members of the Spanish court and the Habsburg family. Mor's new style of portraiture combined austerity and formal poses with insight into his sitters' characters, conveying their humanity along with their importance.
Two angels play a cello and a lute, while a third listens attentively in thebackground. Morazzone first drew the design in black chalk, then went over the figures with a brown wash to flesh out the forms. Finally he added a fine network of parallel hatching and cross-hatching in whitebodycolorto define such delicate details as the feathered wings, flowing drapery, and shining hair of each angel. The blue of the paper, particularly favored by Venetian artists during this time, adds a fourth tone to the scene.Morazzone produced the drawing in preparation for a ceilingfresco, completed in 1599, showing music-making angels in the vault of a rosary chapel in Lombardy. The basic architectural frame is similar in the drawing and the fresco.
This densely populated drawing offers a fascinating array of figures and attitudes. A monumental woman, her right arm outstretched, dominates the center of thecomposition. Behind her, noblemen and women enjoy a sumptuous feast around a long, rectangular table. At either end of the table, dutiful servants attend to the meal and at the left edge of the drawing, a cluster of servants prepare food and drinks. A servant in the leftforegroundprovides musical entertainment for the banquet.Morazzone created this large compositional study for an ambitious painting, likely commissioned by Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Despite its distinctive cast of characters, the drawing's subject has not been firmly identified. Some scholars suggest that the subject is the marriage feast at Cana, whereChristturned water into wine, orEstherbefore Ahasuerus. But there are no figures that are easily identifiable as either Christ orKing Ahasuerus. More recently, it has been proposed that the drawing represents a scene from Greek mythology, the marriage of Thetis and Peleus.
As the shadowy figure of Hercules observes from between two columns in the background, four wild horses rip apart the slender body of King Diomedes. The brown mare fastens her teeth on his arm, while another sinks her jaw into his leg. Bodies of the horses' previous victims lie piled to the right, above a pool of blood-stained water. This scene shows the dramatic climax from the eighth labor of Hercules, who was ordered to capture the four flesh-eating horses belonging to King Diomedes. Hercules killed the king in battle and fed his body to the horses, which tamed them. Gustave Moreau's fascination with violent, emotionally charged subjects portrayed in jewel-like colors typifies mid-1800s French painting. Here Moreau's luminous and delicately applied watercolor washes enhance an already dramatic scene, highlighting the vertical body of the doomed Diomedes, whose extended, stretched limbs repeat the dynamic rearing motion of the brown horse's front legs. In calm contrast, Hercules rests in the background, silhouetted against a blue sky subtly rendered with light patches of wash.
ThecentaurNessus offered to carry Dejanira, the wife of Hercules, across the river Evenus and then abducted her. Having already crossed the river, Hercules hid in the rocky crags beyond, readying a poisoned arrow to let loose on Nessus.Gustave Moreau contrasted the centaur's dark skin and muscular strength with Dejanira's pale flesh and graceful, lithe figure. Indeed, the two figures resemble dancers performing a ballet rather than opponents struggling for sexual conquest. With its jagged mountains, the hazy, mysterious landscape provides an eerie background. Moreau was not interested in presenting detailed information about the setting or its elements; he chose instead to disintegrate forms, allowing them to give way to areas of color that suggest shapes.He meant to includeDejanirain a set of pictures representing the changing seasons; the painting's autumnalpaletteof reds, oranges, browns, dark greens, and creamy whites conveys its other title,Autumn. Moreau described what he had in mind to the painting's first owner:I have tried to render the harmony that may exist between the world of nature at a certain time of year and certain phases of human life. The centaur seeks to embrace this white and graceful form, which is about to escape him. It is a last gleam, a last smile of nature and life. Winter threatens. Night is coming on. It is autumn.
In a light-filled workshop, a nail maker heats an iron rod in a forge. Equipped with hammers and anvils, two coworkers pound nails until sharp. Behind the figure on the left, a dog paces gingerly on a tread-wheel activating the bellows that fuel the forge.This small drawing is one of several studies Jean-Michel Moreau le jeune produced for prints featured in Diderot'sEncyclopdie.Each print catalogues an artisanal occupation-from shoemaker to roofer to floor-tiler-and is accompanied by a brief definition and a legend identifying the specific tools and practices of the trade.To maximize the view of every aspect of the nail-making process, Moreau carefully spread out the objects and workers across thecomposition. The sunlit room quite literally illuminates the profession and showcases Moreau's mastery of gray wash to describe the fall of light and shadows.
Pregnant with her first child and apprehensive, a young woman reclines on a daybed in a mirrored alcove. Facing her across the couch, her friend leans forward and reassures her:  The moment [the birth] is over, you won't give it a thought. . . . I have had four children and am none the worse for it.  The standing priest bolsters her with the words that form the drawing's title:  Have no fear, my good friend! Jean-Michel Moreaule jeunemade this drawing as a finished study for an engraving in the celebrated seriesMonument du costumeof 1776. With a plot loosely structured around the childhood and early marriage of a young man, Moreau depicted a variety of events and illustrated the most fashionable clothing to wear for each.The series reflects the social and moral behavior of the 1700s, but it also forms a vivid record of contemporary taste. The elegantly cut garments, ornate hairstyles, opulent textiles, delicate flowers, and expensive furniture andporcelainreflect the wealth and position of this social circle. Moreau's precise drawing style, focused on brilliantly rendered details and great delicacy of handling, suited both the domestic theme and its setting.
After enduring an epic voyage,Aeneaswas shipwrecked nearCarthageon the coast of North Africa, where Queen Dido received him. Although the two fell in love, Aeneas could not remain with the queen. Jean-Michel Moreau le jeune illustrated the moment after Aeneas announced that he must continue on his journey. Lashing out in rage, Dido hurls abuse at him.Moreau le jeune made this drawing as a highly finished model for an engraving by Jean-Batiste Simonet for thefrontispieceof the second volume of a French translation of Virgil'sAeneid, published in Paris in 1804.
The name of this vase,cuvette Mahon,refers to the British-occupied port of Mahn on the island of Minorca, which was captured by the French in 1756 at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. In addition to thecuvette Mahon,this French victory spawned other objects named after the town, including asauce  la Mahonnaise,now known as mayonnaise.The blue and gold decoration in three different patterns--trellis,pointill,andvermicul--over a pink ground is an unusual combination, very rarely seen on Svresporcelain. Jean-Louis Morin, who painted the farmyard scene, copied it from an engraving after a painting by theFlemishartist David Teniers the Younger.
Moulin was sentenced to a month in prison following the seizure of a number of his nude photographs by the police in 1851. He became more cautious thereafter, registering a large portion of his work with the government in order to claim official sanction. The seductive glance offered by this young woman pushes the image past what was considered acceptable at the time and may be the reason the photographer did not sign it.
A Moorish woman reclines on a sofa stacked with pillows; disaffected, she looks away from the camera. Her skirts are pulled up to reveal bare thighs, and her right hand rests suggestively and deliberately between her legs. Her left arm is bare and raised: in her languor and dishevelment, she displays a sexual availability ordinarily reserved for private eyes.A black woman sits at the end of the sofa, looking bored and distrustful while cradling her mistress's bracelet-topped feet in one hand and resting the other on her calf. Thebackgroundbehind the two women has been cut out, presumably to heighten the visual impact by focusing attention on the sitters.A convention of Orientalist imagery, the subject of the sexually available female attended by a black maid subscribed to a stereotyped fantasy of non-European women. Jacques Antoine Moulin made this image during a trip to Algeria; nine years later, he included it in an album that he compiled to commemorateNapoleon III'strip there.
This large, lidded jar painted with thecoat of armsof Jean d'Arlatan, Baron de Lauris, probably once held tobacco. Amazingly, the original loose-fitting lid, painted with a matching miniature coat of arms, still survives unbroken. A fanciful arrangement of arabesques topped by female busts frames the arms on the front, while the figure of Neptune with a dolphin is centered on the back. These delicatemotifsare based on the engravings of Jean Brain, chief designer to Louis XIV. This jar was produced in Moustiers, at one of the most important and influential of the French faience factories, which was run by the Clrissy family.In 1689 and 1709, Louis XIV ordered the French nobility to turn in all their silver, which was then melted down to pay for debts accumulated by the king during his numerous wars. As a direct result of these laws, faience, tin-glazed earthenware, became popular as a replacement for silver in upper-class households.
The whimsical decorations that cover the surface of this large plate are known asgrotesques. The feathered warrior about to shoot a fantastic bird, the savage with his bow and arrow beside an ostrich, and the violin player are all commonmotifsfound on faience,tin-glazedearthenware, produced in Moustiers. The figures stand on small patches of ground arranged in horizontal tiers, surrounded by hybrid animals, insects, and birds. In the vegetation around the edges, botanists today have recognized flowers that are common in the south of France, where the factory was located.This plate is a product of the Olerys Manufactory located in Moustiers and founded by Joseph Olerys in 1739. Thepaletteof painted enamel decoration--violet, green, and orange-yellow in color--shows the influence of Spanish painted earthenware, which Olerys brought to Moustiers following a trip to Alcora, Spain.
Who is this wildly embracing naked couple  Seated on a large stone beneath a tree in the wilderness, they wrap themselves in each other's arms in a fervent kiss. The helmet in the right corner suggests to some scholars that Jan Harmensz. Muller meant to depict the godsMarsandVenus. But the godMercurywas also traditionally depicted wearing a helmet, so other scholars now believe that the figures may represent Mercury and thenymphLara. In fact, the scene closely resembles a print that Muller engraved of Mercury and Lara.Muller's sure yet delicate contours define both god and nymph with a few simple strokes. Strong pen lines define the outlines of their bodies, while quick flicks of ink suggest the dimpled curves on stomachs, buttocks, and thighs. White bodycolor not only addshighlightsto the figures but also gives their hair texture and depth. Broad, looping strokes and areas of wash merely suggest the surrounding landscape. Scholars believe that the low level of finish suggests that Muller was still working out his ideas for the print that would later follow.
This night landscape represents the coastline at sgrdstrand, a small beach resort south of Oslo in Norway, where Edvard Munch spent his summers from the 1880s onward. Here Munch tried to capture the emotions called forth by the night rather than to record its picturesque qualities. The color blue conveys the mysticism and melancholy of the landscape, which seems full of premonitions. An abstract mound at the right represents a clump of trees; a white fence runs diagonally in front. The vaguely defined shape on the fence may be a shadow of two lovers, a recurring theme in Munch's work. He used an undulating line to depict the shoreline that continues into the trees at the right. Stars reflect in the water, and a flash of light in the trees shines brightly.Varying thicknesses of blue and green paint are blended together to form the impression of a night sky. Some areas are thickly painted, while others are left bare to convey the lighter segments of the sky or a celestial phenomenon.
Hubert Stowitts, the first American star of the Russian ballet, danced for several years as Anna Pavlova's partner. Stowitts was also a choreographer and a designer of sets and costumes whose work was deeply influenced by traditional Indian and Chinese dance. He designed both the dance he performs and the costume he wears in this photograph by celebrity photographer and dance critic Nickolas Muray.
According to Greek myth, the poet Orpheus played the lyre with such magical sweetness that he charmed the animals, birds, and reptiles that gathered around him, subduing their innate hostilities. Orpheus sits in the center of the drawing focused on his music, while around him birds perch overhead, a frog, lizard, and pair of doves crouch at his feet, and horses, deer, an elephant, a goat, and a unicorn draw near.Josias Murer belonged to a family of Swiss glass-painters who worked in and around Zurich in the late 1500s. Scholars know that he produced this drawing as a design for a stained-glass panel, since Murer left a blank border around the composition. No panel with this illustration still survives.The theme of Orpheus charming the animals was one of the most popular among artists living in Northern Europe in the 1500s and 1600s. During this era of intense political upheaval and religious strife, the story came to express the hope in the power of art and poetry to conquer, and even resolve, irreconcilable conflict.
Saint John the Baptistappears as an idealized youth rather than as a young child, his more traditional representation. He sits in the wilderness, holding his reed cross with his left hand and the Paschal Lamb with his right. The subject derives from a passage in theGospel,  John looked towardsJesusand said, 'Behold the Lamb of God.' (John 1:36)Bartolom Esteban Murrillo communicated the same message here through John's direct visual engagement of the viewer's attention. Executed in Murillo's early pen style, the drawing displays his distinctive use ofchiaroscuroand structured hatching.
Saint Francisof Paola is portrayed kneeling in the midst of a desolate landscape, dressed in drab clothing and leaning on a walking stick. The bearded old man expresses devotion to God through a heavenward gaze and a pious gesture. The painter, Bartolom Esteban Murillo, contrasted the saint's humble presence with a brilliant, spiritual vision and a miracle he performed during his lifetime.Murillo combined a realistic approach with an expressive manipulation of paint to underscore this unity of the earthly and the spiritual. The painting is mostly rendered in subdued, earthy tones. But a soft, intense glow infuses the wordCharitas(Charity), bathing five hoveringputtiand the saint in awashof golden light. Saint Francis of Paola founded the austere but charitablemonastic orderof the Minims, whose motto was  charity.  Surrounding the saint, light barely illuminates the dark, rocky terrain. But a bright area in the distance draws attention to anarrativescene: The saint stands on the shore of the Straits of Messina with two companions. After a ship refused them passage, Saint Francis performed a miracle by calming the stormy waters and ferrying the men across on his cloak.
Bartolom Esteban Murillo pictured the Virgin Mary standing in the heavens upon a crescent moon, with her hands folded and loose squiggles of hair and cloak billowing to the left. To create the image, he first drew in black chalk, then rapidly drew the principal contours in pen and ink. Barely discernible are the faint chalk indications of the cloud studded with putti heads on which the Virgin stands, which Murillo did not reinforce, suggesting that he abandoned the sketch before completion.Murillo's native city of Seville was devoted to the cult of the Immaculate Conception, so he painted and drew the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception many times.
Bartolom Esteban Murillo barely suggested the Christ Child's head, which seems almost to emerge from a void determined by his hair and clothing, and jotted in only the barest of settings, a slightly scribbly ground. This bold drafting style, expressed in extremely loose, staccato penstrokes, gives energetic freedom to a standard religious subject. In contrast to the sentimentality and usually smooth brushwork of his paintings, Murillo's drawings display fluidity and spontaneity.Known and admired for his idealized portrayals of children, Murillo often drew and painted scenes of the infancy of Christ, here identified by a shepherd's staff. This attribute also identifies the source of the subject, a passage in the Gospel of Saint John:  I am the good shepherd who gives his life for his sheep. Murillo drew this sketch on the back of a letter; the verso bears extensive writing in brown ink.
With light, delicate strokes, the artist created a scene of almost geometric simplification. Using spare contours and pale washes, he created the long cloak that covers the body of the monk; his small, round head; and the straight lines of the cross. Faint shadows extend out from either foot, as well as from the small winged putto holding an empty escutcheon in the left corner, giving both figures an impression of depth.Scholars guess that the monk may be San Diego de Henares de Alcal, a Spanish lay brother of the Capuchin order who died in 1463. San Diego was sent with missionaries to the Canary Islands and was canonized by Philip II of Spain. The king prayed to him when his son lay dying and, out of gratitude for the boy's recovery, asked the pope to make him a saint. Artists often drew San Diego carrying a cross or with the infant Jesus Christ in his arms.
This largewaxed-paper negativedisplays a view of the private mosque built for the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the 1630s. Dr. John Murray, who made this negative while working in India, altered it to improve the visual harmony and luminosity of the finished print. He achieved increased contrast by blocking out the sky area withpigmentand bleaching the deeply shaded section under the roof to more clearly show the mosque interior.The waxed-paper process was particularly useful for traveling photographers like Murray because the paper did not require immediate development. It also offered more translucency than other commonly used negatives. The process involved rubbing wax into the paper negative before it was sensitized and exposed. The wax created a smooth surface and reduced the blurring effects of paper fibers. Both the negative and the final print display great clarity of detail, as in the piercings of the surrounding wall and the outlines of distant buildings.
...A photograph is made by one of the 24 cameras at every 12 inches of progress, made by the animal during a single stride. The length of each stride may be calculated by the line of consecutive numbers arranged parallel with the track, a number being placed every 12 inches of distance.--Eadweard J. MuybridgeThe possibility for moving pictures originated from a rich man's bet: whether or not a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at any time during its stride. Because the unaided eye cannot see such an instantaneous event, Leland Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to photograph his racehorse, Occidental. After Muybridge produced the proof to win the bet, he continued his motion experiments and documented them in this album. He wrote the above passage on the album's first page, describing his methodical approach of rigging twenty-four cameras with electromagnetic shutters--tripped by wires as an animal ran across a track.Photographs of the cameras show how wires were attached to modified lens shutters; others depict the racetrack, where a long shed with the battery of cameras faced a track with a wall behind to silhouette subjects. Most pages depict animals and humans walking, running, and jumping before the cameras. Muybridge later devised the zoopraxiscope, a rotating device that animated sequences of images.
As the story goes, in 1872 railroad magnate and ex-governor of California Leland Stanford made a bet with a fellow horseman regarding a horse's gallop. Contending that all four of a horse's feet are off the ground simultaneously at some point while galloping, Stanford hired Muybridge to prove it photographically.Muybridge's first photographs of the horse were poorly exposed and thus inconclusive. After constructing a more efficient shutter and improving the speed of his film, he resumed his experiments with motion studies in 1877, but he was still producing only single images. Undaunted, he developed a system of first twelve and eventually twenty-four cameras, whose electro-magnetic shutter blades were opened by the stride of the animal tripping wires strung across the track. This series of twenty-four consecutive frames, which took less than one second to expose, was made after Muybridge had perfected his technique. Ultimately, Muybridge did prove that all four feet of a galloping horse were off the ground simultaneously.
Girolamo Muziano used a number ofdevicesto weave together the elements of this mountain landscape. A protruding rock extends from the left across the stream, leading the eye across the bridge and along a ridge on the far bank and on to a craggy peak in the distance. The small stream descending in a waterfall provides another compositional axis. Muziano used the paper's blank areas to provide his brightesthighlightsand further capture the viewer's attention.As this drawing shows, Muziano's precise technique and cross-hatched shadows were readily translatable to the engraved line. He often supplied compositional drawings for engravings, and this sheet may have been apreparatory studyfor a print. The three variations on thiscompositionin other collections indicate that this drawing may also have originally been intended as part of a series on the penitent saints. One shows a saint in the bottom left corner, while the other two have empty spaces there; perhaps Muziano left the spot open for that purpose.
Horses and athletic training, two of the favorite activities of privileged Athenian youths, decorate this Athenianred-figurecolumn krater. On the front of the vase, two naked athletes work out on either side of a clothed trainer, one with a javelin and the other holding weights used in the long jump. On the back of the vase, two youths walk along leading their horses. As was typical for this shape in the early 400s B.C., afriezeof animals in theblack-figure techniquedecorates the top of the vase's mouth.The Greeks always drank their wine diluted, and the column krater was a vessel for mixing wine and water. A krater like this would have been used at asymposiumor aristocratic drinking party, where the scenes decorating the serving vessels reflected the interests of the participants.
Standing against a wooded landscape, an unknown woman looks out at the viewer while plucking a sprig from a fruit tree. Her pale violet silk dress that shimmers when it catches the light, her elaborately styled hair, and the pearls adorning her hair, ears, and neck identify her as a woman of status.Jan Mytens specialized in portraiture in The Hague, Netherlands, where he enjoyed the patronage of the highest level of society, including the royal court. As in this painting, he often depicted his elegant sitters in half-length standing before idyllic landscapes.
Introduced in the 1860s, cabinet cards were studio-produced photographs mounted on cardstock. Inexpensive multiples offered for public sale, they often featured portraits of celebrities of the day--writers, musicians, actors--and were widely collected. Nadar's photograph ofSarahBernhardt (French, 1844-1923) as Phdre is from a collector's album of cabinet card portraits of Bernhardt by various photographers.A famous actress in the late 1800s, the  Divine Sarah  was a brilliant self-promoter at a time when the basis of celebrity was shifting from the political figure to the theatrical performer. Bernhardt pioneered the use of new technologies to disseminate her image: she was one of the most photographed women in the world, and the first major stage actress to star in films. She made several recordings of famous theatrical dialogues including a reading from Racine's Phdre at Thomas Edison's home.A recognizable figure, Bernhardt--often depicted in theatrical costume--endorsed commercial products. Contemporary with this cabinet card, her image appeared on cigarette cards, an early form of product promotion. Advertisements as well as collectable ephemera, cigarette cards like cabinet cards, reinforced Bernhardt's image in popular culture.
The extraordinary actressSarahBernhardt was about twenty when she posed for Nadar and had barely begun her long and phenomenally successful career. Nadar's photograph was probably the first of innumerable images by painters, photographers, sculptors, and graphic artists. At a time when Nadar was preoccupied with ballooning and willing to leave most of the portrait work to studio assistants, Bernhardt drew him back into the studio to make touching images of her delicate face. Here he wrapped her with a great sweep of velvet that bared one shoulder but showed no more of her slender body, centering all attention on her head, which is seen nearly in profile.The young woman with the supple shoulders and the golden voice became an incomparable and indomitable actress, famous first in France and then throughout the world for playing heroines-and heroes-in a wide variety of plays. Bernhardt's celebrity and the enormous attention she attracted everywhere she went anticipated the phenomenon of late twentieth-century media stars.
When the poet, playwright, and novelist Victor Hugo died in 1885, Nadar went to his deathbed to make a final image as a memorial of the great man. Nadar's sketch of the death chamber showed that black drapery was tied across a window behind the bed and then to one of the bedposts in order to visually isolate Hugo's recumbent figure against a somber background. For the photograph, a mirror reflected light back from the window to provide detail in the shadow area.During the 1800s, Hugo was thought to be France's greatest writer. He began to write while still a schoolboy, and his poetry was first published at twenty. His wildly popular novels soon followed. Hugo's troubled personal life, however, stood in sharp contrast to his successful career. His wife was conspicuously in love with another man, his favorite daughter drowned, and another went mad. A talented amateur artist, he was interested in photography and once contemplated illustrating a book of his poems with photographic negatives. By the time of his death, Hugo was revered: his body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe, and he was buried in the Panthon. Paul Nadar made this print in the 1920s from his father's negative of 1885.
Often referred to as the prince of critics, theater critic, novelist, and literary historian Jules Janin was an amazingly prolific French writer of the mid-1800s, now all but forgotten. In conversation he attributed his forty-year success to his having changed his mind every fifteen days, thus continuing to surprise the attentive audience of his weekly theatrical reviews.Scholars are undecided regarding the authorship of this portrait. For a brief period, Nadar and his brother Adrien Tournachon worked together in the latter's studio in the boulevard des Capucines. Three photographs of Janin wearing these clothes appear to have been made at a single sitting during this period. The three prints suggest a sequence of events in which Janin posed first for Adrien, then for both Adrien and Nadar, and then finally for Nadar alone. Janin's expression becomes progressively less friendly, perhaps due to a quarrel between him and Nadar or perhaps because his gout was troubling him. Nadar inscribed this print with Janin's name; it is probably the middle picture in the series, made by the brothers in collaboration.
Nadar made numerous self-portraits, which allowed him to experiment with poses and gestures before turning the camera on his illustrious subjects. The writer Charles Baudelaire's homage,  Nadar, the most astonishing expression of vitality,  applies easily to the intense young man gazing coyly but self-assuredly at a point just above the lens of his own camera.Perhaps Nadar was merely looking at an assistant helping to make the exposure, but he clearly intended to project an image of himself as the intense,Romanticartist. His left hand braces his body against the chair, while his right hand, cradling his chin and holding up his head, echoes the gesture of his left to create pictorial balance.This photograph was taken at mid-career; Nadar was already a celebrated writer,caricaturist, and portrait photographer. He was thus free to play with self-representation, exploring the many personas that made up a complex and talented man.
She pouts, she scowls: she is Nadar's wife, Ernestine, displaying the universally recognizable  I don't want my picture taken  expression familiar to anyone who has photographed a reluctant subject. But there is affection behind the defiantly crossed arms and the body she haughtily turns away from the photographer's demands. This portrait was made when Nadar was just starting out as a photographer, either just after his and Ernestine's engagement or just after their wedding. Ernestine Lefvre was eighteen years old to Nadar's thirty-four; she was a middle-class girl from Normandy, and he was a bohemian Parisian artist who socialized with painters, writers, and actors. Whatever her thoughts were when this portrait was made, their relationship was apparently a successful one: they had been married for fifty-four years at Ernestine's death.
A favorably disposed nineteenth-century critic described the fiery sculptor Antoine Augustin Prault thus:  The fever of poetry, the drunkenness of beauty, the horror of vulgarity, and the madness of glory possessed and tormented Prault.  Nadar's portrait captured the sculptor's turbulent energy through the tense twist of the pose. Prault's body turns to his right, his head slightly to the left, and his eyes farther to his left. His folded arms wrap around his body, momentarily holding in check his considerable physical and intellectual power, the better to be unleashed.By using strong overhead diagonal light to shape the large dome of the head and to cast half the face into shadow, Nadar emphasized the gravity of Prault's presence. Sitter and photographer produced a portrait that reveals the essence of the man rather than merely his appearance.
That Nadar was able to persuade theRomanticpoet Madame Desbordes-Valmore to sit for him at the very beginning of his career as a photographer had much to do with the reputation he had earlier gained as acaricaturistof literary and artistic circles. Her career, to which she had been late in coming, was nearly over. Although her name is now obscure, she was a well-known poet in her day, highly praised by her peers.When Nadar photographed her, Desbordes-Valmore was sixty-eight. She came to the studio somewhat reluctantly, citing her age and  the cruelty of the sun.  The resigned sadness of her weathered face bespoke not only climate but also the difficulties of her eventful life and the deaths of her brother, two sisters, two daughters, and most of her closest friends in recent years. Nadar focused the camera so carefully on her face and figure that the chair on which she sat and its shadow on the wall receded into the distance together. Nadar later photographed her a final time, on her deathbed in 1859. This is the only known print of this image.
The author of twenty-nine plays, Guillaume-Victor-mile Augier was one of the principal French playwrights of the 1800s. Said to be a bon vivant and something of a lady-killer, Augier here presents a wholly dignified, if distant, appearance for the camera, impeccably dressed and clearly prosperous. He and Nadar had known each other from around the 1840s.At about the same time and from nearly the same angle as this photograph, Nadar made an undatedcaricatureof Augier. Both emphasize, and in the case of the caricature exaggerate, the shape of Augier's most salient feature, his prominent nose. Profile views were rare in Nadar's photographs, probably because they made it impossible to capture the expression of the sitter's eyes and lessened the interaction of subject and photographer. The result here is a more formal portrait than Nadar usually sought.
The writer Alexander Dumas was Nadar's boyhood idol. Nadar's father had published Dumas's first novel and play, and a portrait of Dumas hung in young Nadar's room. The son of aFrench revolutionarygeneral and a black mother, Dumas arrived in Paris from the provinces in 1823, poor and barely educated. Working as a clerk, he educated himself in French history and began to write. In 1829 he met with his first success; with credits includingThe Three MusketeersandThe Count of Monte Cristo, published in 1844 and 1845, respectively, his fame and popularity were assured.Nadar was the first photographer to use photography to enhance the sitter's reputation. Given Dumas's popularity, this mounted edition print, signed and dedicated by him, was likely intended for sale.Dumas is represented as a lively, vibrant man. The self-restraint of his crossed hands, resting on a chair that disappears into the shadows, seems like an attempt to contain an undercurrent of boundless energy that threatened to ruin the necessary stillness of the pose and appears to have found an outlet through Dumas's hair. Around the time of this sitting, the prolific Dumas and Nadar were planning to collaborate on a theatrical spectacle, which was ultimately never staged.
Referred to as the  Michelangelo of the menagerie  by critic Thophile Gautier, Antoine-Louis Barye was about sixty when he posed for Nadar. The son of a Parisian jeweler, he studied animal anatomy thoroughly in books, in laboratories, and at the zoo. When a lion died, he and Eugne Delacroix dissected it. Here his stern visage reflects the notably taciturn man who, although he taught drawing, rarely spoke to his students, correcting their work simply by retouching. The overall effect of self-contained if melancholy dignity, of a man who has survived adversity and is beholden to no one, accords well with contemporary descriptions of Barye. His connection with Nadar was probably established through the painters who were friends of both. Barye was seldom photographed, and this image by Nadar, one of the few existing portraits, was later used as the basis for an etching.
Weary if not haggard, the poet and editor Gustave Mathieu looks out at the viewer with an expression made inscrutable by the cloud of moustache and beard that wholly obscure his mouth. His slight figure is nattily clothed in tartan vest, nubbly tweed trousers, dark jacket, and overcoat. The latter may have been desirable for warmth because at this period many of Nadar's portraits were made in the garden of his rue Saint-Lazare studio.Many of Nadar's sitters were already famous when he photographed them; others became well known later in their lives. Mathieu was neither; his birth and death dates are not known and, aside from this photograph, the remaining records of his life are slight. Mathieu may no longer be a recognized name, but the fact that this is a mounted edition print indicates that Nadar thought there was public interest in his image.
The writer Auguste Luchet regards the camera directly yet distrustfully. His life had been difficult, and his character and appearance were noted for their outward harshness. He was at least twice Nadar's subject, first in 1851 when Nadar made him the subject of a captionedcaricatureand second when he posed for the camera. Despite his rough-hewn appearance, Luchet had a delicacy of expression in conversation and an honest and generous heart.Luchet's political opinions aligned with those of Nadar, and the two men could be supposed to have much in common. It is thus somewhat surprising that Luchet stares suspiciously, awkwardly constrained in his pose. The overall effect of the portrait is intimate but far from flattering.
Here Theophile Gautier embodies the image of theRomanticpoet. He sports an elegant cap of damask cloth trimmed with braid. His shaggy beard and hair seem to grow right into his furry overcoat. He stands gazing thoughtfully away from the camera, solemn and erect, his hand thrust into his waistcoat.Gautier was a poet and journalist who championed the concept of  art for art's sake,  that is, that art need serve no other purpose than to exist for its own achievement. He later softened his approach, explaining that,  smitten in my youngest years with painting and sculpture, I became a delirious lover of art.  Gautier and Nadar were lifelong friends. As editor of the journalL'Artiste, Gautier published many of Nadar's photographs, including this portrait in 1859.The oval print is of the kind that Nadar offered for sale in his studio, an edition print. Another print of this same image is arched at the top like a tombstone.
Luxuriously dressed for her portrait, Madame Labiche wears her hair carefully arranged in the ringlets that were more fashionable in the 1840s than in the 1850s. Contrary to Nadar's usual practice, she is brightly illuminated, making the pattern of her silken dress evident. On the back of her head, she wears a ruffled day cap with wide trailing streamers. Perhaps to better show this complicated headgear, Nadar asked her to turn to one side, creating a profile view that emphasizes her long, straight nose. Her lips part slightly in a suggestion of a smile, indicative of her sweetness of character.Scholars know little of Labiche's life, save that her maiden name was Adle Hubert and that she and playwright Eugne Marin Labiche were married in 1841 or 1842 and had a son named Andr. Sometimes described as an heiress, she came from a respectable and stuffy family that found his profession disreputable and the theatrical milieu immoral. In the introduction to the 1878 collection of his complete plays, which he dedicated to his wife, Labiche recalled that the Hubert family insisted as a condition of his marriage to their daughter that he write no more plays. A year later his wife, seeing his misery, released him from the prohibition.
Jean-Franois-Philibert Berthelier was a singer, comic actor, and a kind of nineteenth-century  pop star.  In the 1850s his performances were wildly popular throughout Europe in concert halls andsalons. This portrait then would have been the equivalent of a publicity photograph. Nadar  photographed Berthelier in character; in a single still image, Nadar  skillfully managed to make the comedianlookfunny.He wears a fanciful, tassel-topped knitted cap while clutching a more sedate hat in front of him. His straw-like hair falls awkwardly around his neck in defiance of gravity and style. Berthelier wears an expression of mischievous glee as he looks off to the side, as if contemplating some act of impropriety taking place just out of the frame.
Gustave Dor was a painter primarily known for his illustrations of books, including a version of the Bible. He was a good friend of Nadar, who photographed Dor many times, even on his deathbed.Dor appears here in the flush of newly earned celebrity, a jaunty young man in checked trousers and a scarf. His sweep of hair cascades across his head as if blown by the wind; his overcoat gapes open to reveal a leg poised to carry him forward, as though he has places to go and can only sit still for a moment. Although the chair in which he sits is clearly visible, he appears to hover unanchored above it. Nadar has captured the spontaneity and energy of a young artist on the rise.
Pierre-tienne-Thodore Rousseau was one of the leading artists of theBarbizon School, also called theplein-air(open air) landscape school of painters. Nadar much admired the Barbizon painters and their emphasis on nature, declaring that among them Rousseau  has long exhausted praise.  Rousseau's melancholy landscapes displayed a wild and untamed view of nature, seemingly incongruous with the refined figure seen here.Rousseau stands looking at the camera with a directness not evident in most of Nadar's portraits. The photographer conveys Rousseau's strong, intense  character; only the unbuttoned second button on his overcoat suggests any lack of discipline on the part of this sitter.
The Bal Mabille was one of the more notoriousSecond Empiredance halls. The subject of this portrait, Finette, is decked out in her finest dress, sporting the lace bonnet with silk bow that the dancers at the Bal Mabille were famous for wearing. Her beauty mark and pin curl distinguish her from the respectable ladies of her day, although only with historical hindsight could this sweet-faced young woman obviously be a person of loose morals, possibly a prostitute. She looks sad, turning absently away from the camera. If, as historians have suggested, Nadar insisted upon covering up her body in the paisley shawl that appears in other photographs, this working girl was possibly disappointed that her portrait by the renowned photographer was not more obviously revelatory of her charms.
Playwright Eugne Scribe poses more conventionally than most of Nadar's sitters from this period. In his mid-sixties, the successful playwright wore elegant and expensive formal daytime clothing. He displays neither playfulness in his costume, as in some Nadar portraits, nor much liveliness of expression. The line of Scribe's mouth is so uncommonly straight as to give little idea of temperament. His left eye is mild and even, but his right eye arrestingly burns out from deep shadow, providing a clue to the anxiety that reportedly caused the playwright to gnaw on his handkerchief when a rehearsal was going badly.Scribe persevered in writing plays despite the failures of his first thirteen works. Critical and popular acclaim, and ultimately great wealth, rewarded his tenacious productivity in writing more than 230 plays and librettos, or texts for musical works. His work is now seldom performed, save for a few operas for which he wrote the librettos.
In Nadar's portrait, the society painter Alexis Prignon exudes a well-dressed prosperity slightly at odds with his weary expression. In 1856 he was decorated with the Legion of Honor, whose insignia he appears to wear on his outer lapel.Nadar's portrait of Prignon bears scant resemblance to the painter's own work, save for his elaborate wardrobe. He is sad-eyed, his expression nearly plaintive, and he has no illusions about the image of gentle fatigue he will present. Although not impatient, he perhaps wished the photographic process were over--despite its brevity when compared to the multiple sittings required for his portrait paintings. By sitting for Nadar, Prignon perhaps tacitly recognized the power of photography to endanger and supplant his own field of endeavor.
Nadar inscribed the reverse side of this print with the name  Mille,  probably an incomplete transcription of the name Millet. The sitter is thought to be the sculptor Aim Millet, about thirty-seven at this time and poised on the brink of his first great success.Nadar placed Millet in a dynamic pose, his body turned away from the camera to the right and his head twisted back over his shoulder to the left. Both the set of his mouth and his forceful gaze indicate strength of purpose tempered by benevolence; the intensity and energy in this refined figure accord with contemporary descriptions of Millet. As often in Nadar's portraits, the white of the sitter's collar sets off the head from the somber tones of the clothing--in this case, a loose-fitting corduroy jacket. The cuff echoes the collar's white, but the sculptor's talented hands are not visible.
For a photographer so gifted in drawing out the essential traits of his sitters, Nadar seems determined here to create a particularly serious presentation of himself. The result is uncharacteristically stiff and inexpressive. His arms are folded and his hands lost in the folds of his sleeves as if he were bound up in a straight jacket.Although by this time Nadar was an entrepreneur, his clothes present an informal combination of disparate elements in keeping with his self-image as an artist and Bohemian. He wears a silk tie so askew as to appear barely tied at all and a white shirt with a loose-fitting spread collar. His long, loose fashionable coat resembles a painter's smock, perhaps a self-referential nod to his occupation.
In this self-portrait, Nadar's myopia makes him appear to be intensely staring at the camera, producing the accurate impression of an unremittingly forceful personality. Suspended on a velvet ribbon, his eyeglasses dangle over one of his wrists. To give an impression of spontaneity, he may have intentionally arranged for them to be visible, because in the process of crossing his arms they would more naturally have fallen between his arm and chest. This photograph has the air of a person trying out an attitude in a mirror, and Nadar may have used a mirror to study its composition. The image's close-up intimacy results from the roughly cut edges, with the head and shoulders filling most of the frame.
Scholars know little of Madame Crmieux, not even her first name, though her maiden name was Silny. A native of Metz in northeast France, she married the lawyer and politician Adolphe (Isaac-Mose) Crmieux in 1824. Her personal qualities were such that in 1869 she was described as being  of the greatest distinction.  She seems demure if not slightly sad, with a faint smile playing about her lips and her eyes lovingly directed toward her husband, who likely stood nearby as she posed.Nadar very much admired Crmieux, whose political views often coincided with his own. He also admired Madame Crmieux and the harmonious marriage she and her husband shared, which lasted for more than fifty years and ended with their deaths one month apart in 1880.
 Art is not a pleasure-trip, it is a battle, a mill that grinds,  remarked the painter Jean-Franois Millet. Born into a peasant family of modest means, Millet celebrated the dignity of manual labor and the humanity, endurance, and piety of the field worker in his paintings. Nadar's portrait of Millet perfectly corresponds with a contemporaneous description of him as  a long, strong, deep-chested man with a full black beard, a grey eye that looks through and through you.  Among his intimates, however, Millet was amiable and occasionally serene.Millet said of photographic portraiture that  this art would never reach perfection till the process could be performed instantaneously and without the knowledge of the sitter. Only in that way, if at all, could a natural and life-like portrait be obtained.  Although he sat for other photographers, Millet may have had the stern formality of Nadar's portrait in mind when he made this statement, perhaps having a milder self-image than this picture gives.
Theophile Gautier here embodies the image of theRomanticpoet. He sports an elegant cap of damask cloth trimmed with braid, and his shaggy beard and hair seem to grow right into his furry overcoat. He gazes thoughtfully away from the camera, solemn and erect, with his hand thrust into his waistcoat.Gautier was a poet and journalist who championed the concept of  art for art's sake,  that is, that art need serve no other purpose than to exist for its own achievement. He later softened his approach, explaining that,  smitten in my youngest years with painting and sculpture, I became a delirious lover of art.  Gautier and Nadar were lifelong friends. As editor of the journalL'Artiste, Gautier published many of Nadar's photographs, including an engraving after this portrait in 1859.Another version of this image, an edition print of the kind that Nadar offered for sale in his studio, was trimmed to an oval.
Nadar very much admired the lawyer and politician, Adolphe (Isaac-Mose) Crmieux, whose political views often coincided with his own. Crmieux was sixty when he sat for Nadar in December of 1856 and, as an opponent ofNapoleon IIIlike Nadar, temporarily inactive in politics. Nadar began the sitting, the only one which he ever described in detail, by talking and laughing with Crmieux while placing him in the best light and adjusting the lens. Nadar seems to have placed the camera slightly lower than the subject's eye level, giving him added stature.Crmieux's contemporaries thought the sitter peculiar in both appearance and manner, although his wife disagreed, insisting that Nadar agree with her that her husband was handsome. At least in retrospect the photographer agreed, finding the man beautiful in the tenderness he inspired and merited but more truly--if unconventionally--beautiful because of his  superior intelligence, infinite goodness, perpetual forbearance, love of justice, and above all the inalterable serenity of his pure conscience. Nadar offered this kind of oval print, an edition print, for sale in his studio. Along with his portrait of Madame Crmieux, this image is exceptional in part because more is known about the circumstances of its making than any of Nadar's other portraits.
When Jules Martial Regnault, called de Prmaray, sat for Nadar in 1857, the two men had known each other for about fifteen years. Before his sitting, de Prmaray wrote to Nadar for advice on the most appropriate clothing for the photograph, suggesting the importance Nadar placed on apparel in his portraits. Whether de Prmaray's velvet smock belonged to him or to Nadar is uncertain, but it seems large for the writer's frail figure and the sleeves appear to have been turned back at the wrists, creating deep satin cuffs.On the back of his photographs, Nadar customarily wrote the professions of his sitters; he designated de Prmaray as a theatrical critic rather than as the playwright he also was. The deep circles under de Prmary's eyes may be symptoms of the severe illness that soon necessitated a three-year course of hydrotherapeutic treatments. By 1859 the critic's precarious health had forced him to give up all kinds of writing, and he died nine years later at age forty-nine.
When Marchal Francisco Serrano y Dominguez sat for Nadar, he was forty-six years old and the Spanish ambassador to France, a post he held only for a year. He is more elaborately turned out than any other sitter to appear before Nadar's camera, bedecked with medals--including the cross of San Fernando--that attest to his military prowess. His carriage erect, he looks thoroughly accustomed to holding himself in this formal posture.Because Nadar also photographed Serrano's successor Narvaez in full formal diplomatic regalia, he may have made the two photographs to commemorate the changing of the Spanish ambassadorial guard in September of 1857. Despite his illustrious career, Serrano is perhaps not remembered much today, even in Spain. In happy coincidence with his splendid appearance, however, the Calle Serrano, Madrid's equivalent of Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive, is named after him.
The turbulent life of the writer Henri Mrger originated and epitomized the durable myth of a starving artist struggling to survive in a garret in Paris. His friends were not-yet-famous poets, artists, writers, and musicians, and his short stories about their lives made him famous. These ironic accounts encapsulated and celebrated the bohemian milieu in which both Nadar and Mrger were conspicuous figures.Nadar and Mrger's lives were entwined throughout the 1840s, their deep friendship ending only when Mrger, weakened by hardship and dissipation at the age of forty, died in Nadar's arms. Shortly afterwards Nadar joined two friends in writing a memorial book that included Mrger's letters. It may have been at this time that Nadar rephotographed his 1857 portrait of Mrger to make this tombstone-shaped print. Mrger appears much older than his thirty-five years, and his eyes are oddly wary as he looks toward the camera and one of his closest friends.
The friendship between the painter Benot-Hermogaste Molin and Nadar dated to the early 1840s; by 1860 Nadar owned two works by the painter. As both men were portraitists, each brought a high degree of consciousness about posing subjects to this sitting, which took place while Molin was visiting from Italy.In order to recall portraiture in the grand manner of Anthony Van Dyck, Nadar chose to engulf Molin in a glamorous and voluminous cape of some shiny fabric, embellished by only a complicated, knotted and looped double cord. As Molin's right arm holds the cape across his body and his left is concealed beneath the garment, Nadar must have been the one who puffed up the end of his cravat to provide an additional flourish of white fabric at the neck. Molin's head, the only visible part of his body, is fully lit, concentrating all attention on his face. The circles beneath his eyes counter-balance the tight curves of his eyebrows.
As he was of royal blood, Leopold, Count of Syracuse was an atypical sitter for the antimonarchical Nadar. How he found his way to Nadar's studio is something of a mystery. Married to a prudish princess whom he apparently disliked, Leopold settled into a life of earthly pleasures, political dissent, lavish generosity, and patronage of the arts. He was nonetheless a talented and ambitious amateur sculptor whose wealth and position made it possible for him to erect public monumental sculptures of his own creation in his native Naples.Alluding to Leopold's job as sculptor or toRenaissanceprincely portraiture, Nadar arranged a great swath of velvet over his sitter's shoulder, effectively shielding his big body. Beneath this sweep of fabric, Leopold appears to wear only a simple shirt with a banded edge, a surprisingly unassuming costume for one of his rank. Together face, drapery, and lighting produce an effect strongly reminiscent of Titian's portraits.
In 1844 both Auguste Vitu and Nadar were journalists, living in garrets in the narrow rue des Canettes, across which they carried on aerial conversations. A jack-of-all-trades literary, Vitu revolved through the editorships of several small newspapers and was by turns editor, political or military historian, drama or literary critic, and writer of fiction and financial manuals.By the time Vitu sat for Nadar in 1860, his appearance betrayed his political opinions. His pointed and waxed mustache and goatee are modeled on those of Napoleon III. Nadar, a progressive thinker, lamented the fact that a man as spirited as Vitu had become a sympathizer of the Empire. The intensity of Vitu's gaze reflects his verve.
Mother Superior Marie Jamet's steady expression combines sad-eyed benevolence and sweetness. A halo of white surrounds and isolates her moon-shaped face from the dark sky of her hooded habit.Nadar was emphatically not religious, and scholars do not know how he came to photograph this nun. She was probably photographed because she was believed to be the founder of an order of nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, who were dedicated to the care of destitute elderly persons. Outside his normal range of literary society sitters, Mother Jamet may have been intrigued by Nadar's reputation as a portraitist.
 [O]ne of those places that everyone wants to see and no one wants to see again  is how Nadar described the catacombs. The Paris catacombs were former underground quarries that were refitted to house skeletons. Nadar ventured into them to create an unprecedented series of photographs illuminated by flashlight. He used a magnesium lamp, visible in the lower right corner of the image.Six or seven million skeletons were interred in the catacombs; in this photograph, seemingly every one is accounted for. Only sixteen carefully stacked protruding skulls on the wall are clearly distinguishable at left, yet they are all that is needed to indicate what the blackened squares in the distance represent.Around the time that Nadar made this series of a hundred photographs in the catacombs, two of his beloved friends passed away. The photographer may have been exploring his own mortality when he embarked upon this series, but it was also a fashionable pursuit to descend into these macabre depths. In mid-nineteenth century Paris, there were four annual visiting days for the catacombs, at which time they were filled with curious onlookers.
The dreamily romantic and physically frail Alphonse Daudet sat for Nadar in the early 1860s, soon after beginning his career as a poet, playwright, and writer of fiction. In Nadar's portrait, Daudet directed his intense gaze to some farther part of the studio. His pose seems wholly unassuming, his right hand toying with the chair fringe.The apparent informality of the pose was not accidental but the result of Nadar's intention to show the modesty of a very young poet of amiable temperament and humble demeanor. Nadar arranged the light so it would fall from the upper left, crisply delineating the smooth lines of Daudet's forehead and cheek and so illuminating his hair as to turn its color from black to brown.
Despite its small scale, Nadar meant thiscarte-de-visiteself-portrait to promote his extremely costly ballooning ventures. He hoped that circulation of these images of him seemingly rising into the sky in the gondola of a balloon might attract more paying spectators to the balloon ascensions he staged. Since cartes-de-visite sold for low prices, their sale alone would not have produced enough income to defray aeronautical expenses. Instead, they were likely given away as publicity.These photographs were a mixture of self-aggrandizement and profit-seeking and, at least to a modern eye, also humorous for their incongruities. The woven basket in which Nadar posed was probably a laundry hamper suspended on ropes in the studio--too small to carry a man comfortably for any distance, particularly kneeling, as the five-foot-ten Nadar must be doing. To give a modest illusion that he was flying, he posed his pretend balloon against a painted backdrop of clouds. He may have chosen dandyish clothes in order to imply that ballooning was a safe, even gentlemanly enterprise, in which money could be judiciously invested. His binoculars advertise the view to be had from on high, and the anchor adds a note of authenticity.

Since cartes-de-visite sold for low prices, their sale alone would not have produced enough income to defray aeronautical expenses. Instead, they were likely given away as publicity, although Nadar used the back of this one to write a note urging his assistants to make a certain Madame Grandet at home in the studio.These photographs were a mixture of self-aggrandizement and profit-seeking and, at least to a modern eye, also humorous for their incongruities.

His binoculars advertise the view to be had from on high, and the anchor adds a note of authenticity.
However much she may have deplored Nadar's enormous expenditures on his ballooning experiments, Madame Nadar supported him in the enterprise. Women's clothing of the 1860s, particularly the fashionable, enormous crinoline skirts, was clearly unsuitable for balloon ascensions, so she adopted men's clothing tailored to her specifications, including a soft-brimmed bowler hat into which her hair could be tucked. Among her accessories in some of these nine poses are what appear to be a case for binoculars and the anchor for a balloon, used to attach to a tree or the ground when descending.
Despite its small scale, Nadar meant thiscarte-de-visiteself-portrait to promote his extremely costly ballooning ventures. He hoped that circulation of these images of him seemingly rising into the sky in the gondola of a balloon might attract more paying spectators to the balloon ascensions he staged. Since cartes-de-visite sold for low prices, their sale alone would not have produced enough income to defray aeronautical expenses. Instead, they were likely given away as publicity, although Nadar used the back of this one to write a note urging his assistants to make a certain Madame Grandet at home in the studio.These photographs were a mixture of self-aggrandizement and profitseeking and, at least to a modern eye, also humorous for their incongruities. The woven basket in which Nadar posed was probably a laundry hamper suspended on ropes in the studio--too small to carry a man comfortably for any distance, particularly kneeling, as the five-foot-ten Nadar must be doing. To give a modest illusion that he was flying, he posed his pretend balloon against a painted backdrop of clouds. He may have chosen dandyish clothes in order to imply that ballooning was a safe, even gentlemanly enterprise, in which money could be judiciously invested. His binoculars advertise the view to be had from on high, and the anchor adds a note of authenticity.
Auguste Vacquerie, a poet, playwright, paintings collector, and occasional art critic, was admitted to poet Victor Hugo's intimate circle as a very young man. While in exile with Hugo and his family on Jersey, Vacquerie continued to write, grew the beard he wears in Nadar's portrait, and, having learned photography from Hugo's son Charles, made a series of photographs documenting the family and the local landscape. Thus for a short time Vacquerie was a photographer, one of the very few whom Nadar photographed.In order to compete with painted portraits, photographers of the 1850s and 1860s frequently employed artists to embellish their images. Nadar was not an exception in this practice, although few painted photographs from his studio have survived. In this example, variously dense layers of reddish-black ink cover almost the entire surface of the print, with the overall effect of coarsening the image. Although the ink has been skillfully applied, particularly in the hair and beard, the subtlety of expression around Vacquerie's eyes has been lost and the shape of his mouth distorted. The retoucher radically changed the shape of Vacquerie's left sleeve by painting out a billowing wrinkle in order to simplify the silhouette. With his photographic sensibilities, Vacquerie may have rejected the painted proof, causing it to remain in Nadar's studio.
Amandine-Aurore-Lucile Dudevant, ne Dupin, took the pseudonym George Sand in 1832. She was a successfulRomanticnovelist and a close friend of Nadar, and during the 1860s he photographed her frequently. Her writing was celebrated for its frequent depiction of working-class or peasant heroes. She was also a woman as renowned for her romantic liaisons as her writing; here she allowed Nadar to photograph her, devoid of coquettish charms but nevertheless a commanding presence.This portrait is a riot of textural surfaces. The sumptuous satin of Sand's gown and silken texture of her hair have a rich tactile presence. Her shimmering skirt melts into the velvet-draped support on which she leans, creating a visual triangle with the careful center part of her wavy hair. The portrait details the exquisite laces, beads, and buttons of her gown, but her face, the apex of the triangle, is out of focus. Sand was apparently unable to remain perfectly still throughout the exposure, and the slight blurring of her facial features erases the unforgiving details that the years had drawn upon her.
Introduced in the 1860s, cabinet cards were studio-produced photographs mounted on cardstock. Inexpensive multiples offered for public sale, they often featured portraits of celebrities of the day--writers, musicians, actors--and were widely collected. Nadar's photograph ofSarahBernhardt (French, 1844-1923) as Phdre is from a collector's album of cabinet card portraits of Bernhardt by various photographers.A famous actress in the late 1800s, the  Divine Sarah  was a brilliant self-promoter at a time when the basis of celebrity was shifting from the political figure to the theatrical performer. Bernhardt pioneered the use of new technologies to disseminate her image: she was one of the most photographed women in the world, and the first major stage actress to star in films. She made several recordings of famous theatrical dialogues including a reading from Racine's Phdre at Thomas Edison's home.A recognizable figure, Bernhardt--often depicted in theatrical costume--endorsed commercial products. Contemporary with this cabinet card, her image appeared on cigarette cards, an early form of product promotion. Advertisements as well as collectable ephemera, cigarette cards like cabinet cards, reinforced Bernhardt's image in popular culture.
The extraordinary actressSarahBernhardt was about twenty when she posed for Nadar and had barely begun her long and phenomenally successful career. Nadar's photograph was probably the first of innumerable images by painters, photographers, sculptors, and graphic artists. At a time when Nadar was preoccupied with ballooning and willing to leave most of the portrait work to studio assistants, Bernhardt drew him back into the studio to make touching images of her delicate face. Here he wrapped her with a great sweep of velvet that bared one shoulder but showed no more of her slender body, centering all attention on her head, which is seen nearly in profile.The young woman with the supple shoulders and the golden voice became an incomparable and indomitable actress, famous first in France and then throughout the world for playing heroines-and heroes-in a wide variety of plays. Bernhardt's celebrity and the enormous attention she attracted everywhere she went anticipated the phenomenon of late twentieth-century media stars.
When the poet, playwright, and novelist Victor Hugo died in 1885, Nadar went to his deathbed to make a final image as a memorial of the great man. Nadar's sketch of the death chamber showed that black drapery was tied across a window behind the bed and then to one of the bedposts in order to visually isolate Hugo's recumbent figure against a somber background. For the photograph, a mirror reflected light back from the window to provide detail in the shadow area.During the 1800s, Hugo was thought to be France's greatest writer. He began to write while still a schoolboy, and his poetry was first published at twenty. His wildly popular novels soon followed. Hugo's troubled personal life, however, stood in sharp contrast to his successful career. His wife was conspicuously in love with another man, his favorite daughter drowned, and another went mad. A talented amateur artist, he was interested in photography and once contemplated illustrating a book of his poems with photographic negatives. By the time of his death, Hugo was revered: his body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe, and he was buried in the Panthon. Paul Nadar made this print in the 1920s from his father's negative of 1885.
AsChristand his disciples approach the town of Nain in Galilee, they meet the funeral procession of a young man, followed by his widowed mother. Pitying the poor woman, Christ lifts one hand towards the bier, and the body of the man comes to life. In front of an arched gateway leading into the town, a crowd gathers around Christ and the dead man as he prepares to rise by stretching out one leg. Giovanni Battista Naldini presented the dramatic conclusion to a miracle found in Saint Luke'sGospel. He sketched the scene quickly with pen and brown ink, focusing on the huddledmassof figures rather than the details of individual faces. Dark strokes of brown wash give depth and form to the shapes, while whiteheighteningcreateshighlightson the muscular naked body of the dead man, on Christ's lower robes, and on other figures in theforeground. Naldini made this drawing as a preparatory sketch for analtarpiecefor a church in Florence.
Giovanni Battista Naldini used each side of this page to experiment with several positions for this male nude's arms and legs. On therecto, the man leans sharply forward, hands wrapped around the ledge or with the fingers folded under, knuckles supporting his weight in an alternate pose. The red chalk study on theverso, which is faintly drawn and somewhat rubbed, shows the same figure with his hands placed in the higher of the two positions from the recto.The striking pose of these figures closely recalls an onlooker in afrescoby Andrea del Sarto in a Florentine church.
Robert Nanteuil made thispastelportrait of Louis Doni d'Attichy, theBishopof Riez and later of Autun, as apreparatory studyfor an engraving made in 1663. Scholars believe that the print was intended to adorn the cover of a doctoral thesis dedicated to the eminent bishop. Broadly defining the sitter's garments and leaving thebackgroundplain, Nanteuil concentrated on modeling the facial features with the utmost precision, giving the illusion of rendering the sitter with exacting realism.
Documents in the Svres porcelain manufactory archives call these vesselsvases  ttes de bouc( goat's head  vases), after their elaborate handles modeled in the form of rams' heads with grape vines hanging from their mouths. Despite their removable stoppers, these vases were purely decorative objects, serving no practical purpose.The distinctive decoration of bold patterns ingildingover a dark blue ground is typical of a style popular in the 1760s. The Svres manufactory only introduced this deep blue glaze, known first asbleu nouveau(new blue) thenbeau bleu(beautiful blue), in 1763.
Charles-Joseph Natoire, who was often praised for his sensual depiction of the female nude, skillfully evoked the qualities of flesh in the full lips, long neck, rounded shoulder, and smooth, rosy cheeks of this head study. Natoire used meticulous layers of chalk and pastel for his subject's complexion, and long, loose chalk strokes for her hair. He made this drawing as a study for theEntry of Marc Antony into Ephesus, the first of three designs he created for a tapestry series to be woven at the Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory. In the completed design, this figure dances in the foreground, holding a tambourine-like musical instrument in her outstretched arms. Her upward gaze is directed to Marc Antony, who stands behind her, high on his chariot. Natoire's designs failed to please the Marquis de Marigny, Louis XV's director-general of theBtiments du Roi, and only one tapestry from the series was ever produced.
Madame Bonnier de la Mosson, a member of Parisian society whose literary salon was a popular meeting place for the most noted people of her day, appears as Diana, goddess of the moon, the forest, and the hunt. Jean-Marc Nattier depicted her seated in front of a dramatic sky and barren landscape, delicately holding a bow and arrow, wearing a revealing white chemise low on her shoulders, and wrapped in an exotic leopard skin.In eighteenth-century France it was fashionable for aristocratic women to have their likenesses made in the guise of mythological or historical roles. Nattier, one of the leading portraitists of his day, specialized in these flattering allegorical portraits. During his career, he painted portraits of most of the circle of Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour in either traditional or allegorical guise.
The contrasting textures and subtly modulated hues of this warm, sunny mountain valley; the high-rising rocks and trees that form a strong vertical element; and the picturesque buildings in thebackgroundreflect the artists' debt to DutchItalianatelandscape painters. Dutch landscapes of this type were collected in eighteenth-century England and France, where they influenced the development ofRococolandscape painting.A landscape specialist, Herman Nauwincx usually collaborated with a figure painter, in this case Willem Schellinks, who adapted himself easily to the style of Italianate artists such as Nauwincx. Both artists were active in Amsterdam, where this poetic panel was probably painted. The subject of a wooded mountain landscape with water in theforegroundis typical of Nauwincx, whose prints offer parallels with this scene.
Amidst a rapidly changing urban landscape, Charles Ngre photographed traditional street people. The itinerant musician, stooped slightly from the weight of his instrument, is about to enter a door. One foot stands on the step and his hand rests upon the doorknob. In comparison with Andr-Adolphe-Eugene Disdri'sOrgan-Grinder, made around the same time, this musician is depicted at the weary end of a day's labor rather than playing at his instrument.Because exposure times in the 1850s prevented much spontaneity, Charles Ngre had to pose his subject upon the threshold in a stance that the organ-grinder could maintain for the duration of the exposure. The vignette effect of the print's darkened edges was a technical sacrifice that Ngre accepted in order to shorten his exposure time. Serving also as a frame for the subject, the dark rim draws the viewer's attention to the isolated figure and produces a more focused image.
This leaf registers the names of all the members of the shoemaker's guild in the neighborhood of San Procolo in Bologna, the area where the leaf's artist lived. The bottom of the page contains thecoat of armsof the guild with a leather-cutting tool, a shoe, and a sandal. At the top left, the artist depicted a massive, imposing figure ofSaint Dominic. The weighty presence of Dominic sets off his sensitive, expressive face and the delicate manner in which he holds a bunch of lilies. Dominic was included on this leaf because the neighborhood of San Procolo included the parish of the church of San Domenico. The artist, Niccol da Bologna, was active in local government and had an official job as the cityilluminator. In that capacity he illuminated guild registers like this one.
This illumination shows Pentecost, the moment in which the Holy Spirit descends upon the twelve apostles in order to give them the ability to speak foreign languages so they might preach throughout the world. Although all twelve apostles are shown, sometimes only a forehead or a hint of a nose indicates the body. The narrative style of the artist, Niccol da Bologna, was often crowded and intense. His solid, squat figures are compressed into the small space of the initial, overlapping one another. This cutting is one of twenty known large historiated initials made for a choir book commissioned by the Carthusian monastery of Santo Spirito in Lucca.
Young children had difficulty remaining still for the long exposure times necessary to produce adaguerreotype.Sheldon K. Nichols ingeniously solved this problem with this pose, in which the little sister rested her head and body against her big sister. The pose was so successful that the younger girl looks relaxed, as though she is actually enjoying the experience, and she also gets to show off her new ballet slippers.
This plate tells the story of a musical contest between the godApolloand the satyrMarsyas, drawn fromOvid'sMetamorphoses. According to the ancient legend, Marsyas discovered a flute and foolishly challenged Apollo, master of the lyre, to a contest, the winner of which could inflict whatever punishment he chose on the loser. The figures on this plate are adapted from twowoodcuts. On the left, Apollo stands watching a young Marsyas attempting to play his instrument upside down. The victorious Apollo, on the right, then takes a particularly cruel revenge, tying his opponent, now changed into an old and bearded man, to a tree and flaying him alive. This plate, which was part of a larger service, displays thecoat of armsof the family who commissioned it in the center.
Italian nobles dressed in their finery gather in pairs or small groups as they enjoy the wedding festivities of a noble couple. Nicol dell'Abate may have drawn this scene from the popular romantic epicsOrlando innamoratoandOrlando furioso,which looked back on medieval chivalry with Renaissance nostalgia.Nicol dell'Abate made this highly finished oil sketch as a study for a painting. The tiny holes pricked in the figures in the left foreground indicate that they were being prepared for transfer to a wall, canvas, or panel. The artist or his assistants would have blown fine charcoal dust through the holes to reproduce the exact design.Three related studies by Nicol, similar in size, shape, and style, also depict chivalric subjects, again possibly from theOrlando cycle.He may have used all these drawings in preparation for anOrlandocycle that he painted in the ducal palace in Sassuolo, near Modena.
The legendarySaint Catherine of Alexandriagracefully thanks God the Father and his angels for rescuing her from torture on a spiked wheel. The soldiers of the emperor Maxentius had attempted to break this faithful Christian on the wheel because of her public protest against the worship of idols, but the wheel fell to pieces and she was unhurt. Flying splinters were said to have killed some spectators.In this large drawing, Nicol dell'Abate integrated two complex sets of figures against a characteristically picturesque and elaborate landscapebackground. In theManneriststyle, he moved the action in both heavenly and earthly realms to the front of the picture. Arranging assorted figures in a variety of exaggerated positions along an agitated line at the bottom, Nicol added humor by featuring a splinter-filled spectator's backside at the right. He derived the upper group of figures--God looming in profile and the repetitive angels receding in a diagonal underneath a cloud formation--from a ceilingfrescoby Pordenone.
Though the function of this vase was primarily decorative, its interior was once fitted with a tray to support flowering bulbs. When it held flowers, the pierced lid of the vase was not used. When there were no flowers, the pierced lid was replaced, and the vase could be used to hold potpourri.The Niderviller porcelain manufactory modelers invented this unusual Rococo shape. The factory's painters-perhaps the artist Joseph Deutsch, who may have left the initialsJ.D.painted on the front of the box-added the finely painted perspective view, floral garlands, and a local noble's coat of arms. The arms show that the noble was Grand Commander of the Teutonic Knights between 1758 and 1775.
The Panathenaia, a state religious festival, honoredAthena, the patron goddess of Athens. Held in its expanded form every four years, the festival included athletic, musical, and other competitions. Amphorae filled with oil pressed from olives from the sacred trees of Athena were given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. These amphorae had a special form with narrow neck and foot and a standard fashion of decoration. One side showed Athena, the goddess of war, armed and striding forth between columns, and included the inscription  from the games at Athens.  The other side showed the event for which the vase was a prize. Leading vase-painters, commissioned by the state, decorated these vessels, which continued to be decorated in theblack-figure techniquelong after it had gone out of fashion for other vases, probably due to religious conservatism. The same conservatism applied to the depiction of Athena.On this example, the figure of Athena is portrayed in anArchaisticor old-fashioned style. TheNikefigures atop akanthos columns flanking Athena are a detail that allows scholars to date this vase precisely to 363 2 B.C. The back of the vase depicts Nike, the goddess of victory, crowning the winner of a boxing match between young men, while an older, bearded judge looks on. The leather thongs held by the youths identify them as boxers; they were wrapped around the hands and served as the ancient equivalent of boxing gloves. In 370 B.C. the victor in youth boxing won forty amphorae of oil; the second place winner took home eight.
A sacramentary, the most important type of liturgical book used in the early medieval Church, contains the prayers recited by the priest at Mass. The book lay open on the church altar--the most sacred site within the building--where the priest celebrated the Mass while worshipers looked on. This Ottonian manuscript includes a full-page Crucifixion and beautiful illuminated initials executed in gold and silver ink. The quality of the decoration of this manuscript, of which only a fragment survives, suggests that it may have been made for the occasion of the consecration in 1017 of Hugh, the young son of Robert the Pious king of France, as Robert's co-ruler and successor. Since it includes prayers addressed to saints venerated at Beauvais, the book may have been presented by King Robert to the bishop of Beauvais, who was present at the consecration event. The writing and illumination have been attributed to Nivardus of Milan, who worked at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Benot-sur-Loire, at Fleury, France. In addition to the gold and silver letters, the manuscript is decorated with elaborate interlace ornament and sprays of leaves that recall classical and ninth-century Carolingian models.
This page marks the beginning of the prayers recited by the priest during the preparation of the bread and wine for the Eucharist, the Christian sacrament that early Christian commentators associated with the Jewish tradition of sacrifice. The opening wordsTe igitur(You, therefore) are placed within the framed miniature.Inspired by the relationship between the Eucharist and Christ's sacrifice on the cross, the illuminator transformed the opening letterTinto the cross of the Crucifixion. While the Virgin Mary and Saint John stand at the foot of the cross and turn towards Jesus with the traditional gestures of mourning, Jesus' powerful body and open eyes suggest his ultimate victory over death. The use of purple-painted parchment, long associated with art works of imperial patronage, enhances the image's majesty, while the exuberant interlace boxes that link the cross ends with the image's frame add tension and vibrancy to the design.
This page contains the first line of a prayer for Easter. The initial letter, aDin the round shape of the uncial script, occupies most of the page and supports a growth of dynamic interlace that winds around the letter. After the initialD, the first line of text continues in gold on a bar at the bottom of the page:D[eu]s qui hodierna die(O God, who on this day).An exuberant gold vine with silver leaves springs from a pair of twisted columns flanking the large initial. Two figures, who bear no thematic relationship to the text, climb on the vine. Their poses and the colors of their clothing--one in blue tunic and red leggings and the other in red tunic and blue leggings--contribute to the lively design of the page as a whole.
The modern-day visitor to Paris would have difficulty recognizing this vista of what was then called Place Louis XV but is now Place de la Concorde. The painting was made before 1787, when construction began on the bridge that now crosses the river there. In the foreground, figures strolling along the left bank of the Seine had a clear view across the river of the grand, ceremonial space linking the Champs Elyses, shown all the way on the left by a triumphal arch, with the Tuileries gardens on the far right. In the center, two imposing buildings housed government offices. In front of these buildings is a monumental bronze equestrian statue of Louis XV that was melted down for a cannon in 1792. As one of the great new public spaces in Paris in the 1700s, the Place de la Concorde was portrayed by many painters and engravers.
Four rigid bronze forms create a skeletal tent. Two interlocking diagonal beams serve as the tent's opening. These beams, as well as a third vertical form, have pointed tops suggestive of spears. Positioned on top of these beams, a single horizontal beam demarcates the tent's top edge. This snake-like form also insinuates violence: its gaping mouth, sharp fangs, and bulging eyes suggest that within the tent lies danger.Isamu Noguchi originally created this form as a stage set for choreographer and dancer Martha Graham's 1950 productionJudith. This sculpture is one of three bronze casts made from the balsawood original that appeared on stage. Graham'sJudithwas based on the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. The widow Judith seduced and then decapitated the general Holofernes who was laying siege to her hometown. Noguchi's sculpture alludes to the tent in which Judith beheads Holofernes. The tent's phallic spears convey Holofernes' desire for Judith; the serpent form, the peril awaiting the doomed general.Noguchi created stage sets throughout his career. When working on a scenic design, he would often arrange the elements on a miniature stage. This allowed him to play with the formal and spatial relationships between the objects. Noguchi desired his three-dimensional forms to animate space and positively alter the viewer's experience of the environment.
Venus, goddess of beauty and love in ancient mythology, leans on a tree trunk to remove her remaining sandal. She turns inward, drawing the viewer in to examine her nude body. Carved fully in the round, the figure provides views from multiple angles.Along with statues ofMinervaandJuno, Venus illustrates the subject of the Judgment of Paris, drawn from ancient mythology, when Paris was asked to judge which of the three goddesses was the most beautiful. Venus, here carved in a satiny white marble and in the greatest state of undress, won.
These three marble statues representingMinerva,Juno, andVenusformed part of aJudgment ofParisgroup. TheNeoclassicalgoddesses accompanied a figure of Paris; now considered to be primarily a pastiche from the 1700s, the figure of Paris was then believed to be a heavily restored Roman marble statue, with parts perhaps dating to the 100s A.D. In the ancient mythological story, Paris judged who was the most beautiful among the three goddesses. Although the figures have a cool remoteness, a powerfulnarrativeengagement animates the group in a way rare for sculpture of the 1700s. Indeed, the artist's conception of using a room as a stage for the narrative recalls Bernini's dramaticBaroquecompositions.Charles Watson-Wentworth, second Marquess of Rockingham, commissioned the three statues from English sculptor Joseph  Nollekens. As a testament to hisclassicaleducation and the taste he developed during hisGrand Tourof Italy at age eighteen, the marquess assembled this group and other works in his Neoclassical sculpture gallery. The group was designed for the marquess's London house, and after 1782, taken to his heir's estate at Woodhouse, near Rotherham in Yorkshire.
Goddess of war and wisdom, the statelyMinervastands like a majestic column as she raises her helmet. At her side rests a large shield, on which is carved the frightening head of the Medusa, used to ward off enemies. Her body is composed in a spiral, which provides interesting views from several different angles. The marble statue formed part of a Judgment ofParisgroup. According to ancient mythology, Paris was chosen to decide betweenJuno, Minerva, andVenusfor the title of  the fairest.  Although Minerva promised him fame and glory in war, Paris chose Venus.
MatronlyJuno, goddess of marriage in Roman mythology, bares one breast and undoes her dress forParis'sjudgment of who among the three goddesses,Venus,Minerva, and Juno, was the most beautiful. This ample figure, crowned and heavily draped, stood with three other marble statues representing Venus, Minerva, and Paris.
Jean-Antoine Nollet designed and assembled this pair of globes, which show maps of the earth's surface and skies. Globes frequently adorned the libraries of the aristocracy, lending an air of scholarly respectability in an age when uncharted territories around the world were being mapped and new trade routes established. They frequently appeared in eighteenth-century portraits but were usually supported on simple turned columns. These examples, with their red and yellowlacqueredstands decorated with Chinese figures, are exceptionally elaborate and may have been made to match similarly lacquered furniture.A pair of globes on tripod stands similar to those in the Getty Museum's collection is reproduced in an engraving from 1740 of the library of a wealthy eighteenth-centuryfinancier, Joseph Bonnier de La Mosson. The second floor of his townhouse was devoted to a series of seven rooms, including a chemistry room with fountains and ovens; an apothecary; alatheroom; a room for his drug supplies; a room that housed his collection of minerals and rare animals, stuffed or in jars; and a room filled with machines and models relating to clockmaking, navigation, and hydraulics.
Jean-Franois Nollet, a noted scientist who taught physics to the French royal children, designed and assembled this globe, which shows a map of the earth's surface. In 1728 he dedicated it to the duchesse du Maine, the wife ofLouis XIV'seldest illegitimate child. The duchesse was Nollet's most importantpatronand aunt to the comte de Clermont, to whom the celestial globe is dedicated.Louis Borde, the engraver of the map, also sponsored the costly printing process. He was the publisher who provided the money needed for the engraving of the copper plate, supervised the different stages of printing and the distribution of the prints, and remained in principle the owner of the plate.
Jean-Franois Nollet, a noted scientist who taught physics to the French royal children, designed and assembled this globe, which shows a map of the night skies. He dated the globe1730and dedicated it to Louis de Bourbon-Cond, comte de Clermont.Clermont was an importantpatronof the arts who became protector of the Socit des Arts in 1728. This was a new organization established to provide collaboration between the arts and sciences; painters, sculptors, astronomers, clockmakers, architects, and goldsmiths were all members.
Alfred Stieglitz leans over a photograph, retouching the print in order to correct any minute white spots caused by dust on the negative. Behind him are two paintings by John Marin, an artist frequently exhibited at Stieglitz's New York gallery,An American Place.One of Stieglitz's photographs takes center place in this portrait. Despite their respective marriages and a considerable difference in age, Dorothy Norman and Stieglitz had an intimate relationship. As a result of Stieglitz's encouragement, Norman began experimenting with photography in the early 1930s. In her memoirs she described her initial entry into photography as  opening up a new world,  in which she became  increasingly challenged and entranced.  Many of the portraits she made of Stieglitz became part of her 1973 biography,Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer.
Dorothy Norman composed this striking portrait of Alfred Stieglitz in such a direct manner that it resembles a passport or driver's licensesnapshot. The shadow behind Stieglitz reveals that he is indeed up against a wall, while the donning of his hat and overcoat indicate that the picture was not made at a moment of relaxation. Norman had been experimenting with photography under Stieglitz's instruction for about six years when she made this image. Often regarded as the father of American photography, Stieglitz was an influential figure in Norman's life. After meeting at his New York gallery, they began an intimate relationship that lasted almost two decades. In the 1930s, Norman published a journal entitledTwice A Year,which contained reproductions of Stieglitz's work as well as essays on his philosophy of art and its interpretation.
 I photograph, photograph, photograph. I learn as much from Stieglitz's making portraits of me as I do from my own mistakes. Portraying him becomes more and more difficult. While I remain beautifully still for him, he makes comical faces, sticks out his tongue . . . anything to make me laugh-before he settles down . . .  Thus Dorothy Norman revealed that Alfred Stieglitz was not always as serious as he appears in this photograph. Norman and Stieglitz met at his New York gallery in 1927 and soon after began an intimate relationship that continued until his death almost twenty years later. Norman frequently photographed Stieglitz, whose heavy eyelids, thick spectacles, and bushy eyebrows provided a soft frame for his powerful gaze. This thoughtful image conveys the closeness and trust shared by the maker of the photograph and her subject.
Dorothy Norman made this photograph of Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Jean Steichen atAn American Place,Stieglitz's third and final New York gallery. In this portrait, Steichen holds an unknown work of art and presumably consults with Stieglitz. Norman, a writer and liberal activist, was a vital presence at the gallery, overseeing the gallery's operations and frequently photographing Stieglitz and his visitors. She made this image shortly before Steichen became Curator of Photographs at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
Huddled closely together, the Virgin suckles the infantChristwhile Mary Magdalene andSaint Catherine of Alexandrialook on in adoration. Behind,Josephstands conversing with Saint Anne, Mary's mother. The sitting women seem large and compressed into a small space, and bright, vibrant hues of yellow, green, and red describe the clothing. The tight space, vivid colors, and twisted, artificial postures of the figures reflect the most advancedManneriststyle from Rome. Arranged in a loose pyramidal shape, the faces of the three young women are classically idealized. Mary Magdalene and Saint Catherine wear jewelry and expensively brocaded fabrics, in contrast to the simple garments of Mary, Joseph, and Anne.
A muscular young man with a strong profile, who looks fully destined to kill a giant and to reign as Israel's king, this David is no innocent boy with a slingshot. Carelessly cradling Goliath's huge, severed head with one arm and his oversize sword in the other, he gazes off into the future.Pietro Novelli set David against a blank background, pushed his three-quarter-length body up close to the picture plane, and portrayed him as a common man rather than a patrician, following Caravaggio's famous examples. He followed Jusepe de Ribera in using a darkpalette, portraying David as an individual rather than a generic common man, and emphasizing the ghastliness of Goliath's head. Novelli probably painted this picture during his time in Naples, where these dramatic contrasts of light and shade were typical.
This drawing illustrates Christ's agony as recounted in the Gospel of Saint Luke:  He himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray: `Father, if it be thy will, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but thine be done.' And now there appeared to him an angel from heaven bringing him strength, and in anguish of spirit he prayed the more urgently; and his sweat was like clots of blood falling to the ground. 
A well-dressed young man serenades his beloved outside her window. With his feathered cap and the abundant folds of his cape flowing to the ground, the guitarist makes a striking visual statement against a plain backdrop. His body faces the lover's window, but he turns his head toward the viewer granting access to his confident, comfortable gaze.The object of his musical affection is not shown. But in the lower margin, an inscription in Venetian dialect narrates the man's actions. Loosely translated it reads: To relieve the beloved of her longing, he sings while scratching the guitar. The work's inscription seems innocent enough, but the wordssmaraandchittarahad rather vulgar meanings in Venetian slang of the period. The phallic guitar reinforces these salacious undertones. That the entire scene is placed within a lined border suggests that the drawing served as a design for a print and was perhaps part of a series of engravings illustrating bawdy Venetian sayings.
On September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and instructed his armies to implement the order as they advanced into Confederate states. Among the first slaves to be liberated were those on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation near Beaufort, South Carolina, which had been occupied by the Union army since late 1861.Newly freed men, women, and children are recorded at the historic moment as they assembled for their departure. Timothy O'Sullivan made this view of more than a hundred individuals standing in front of their former quarters, their meager belongings packed in burlap bundles as they begin their lives of freedom. The numerous blurred figures indicate the moment's transitory nature. Even though many in the group look up toward the camera to be photographed for the first time in their lives, the act of being recorded was clearly subordinate to the emancipation at hand.
Slowly, over the misty fields of Gettysburg--as all reluctant to expose their ghastly horrors to the light--came the sunless morn, after the retreat by [General Robert. E.] Lee's broken army. Through the shadowy vapors, it was, indeed, a  harvest of death  that was presented; hundreds and thousands of torn Union and rebel soldiers--although many of the former were already interred--strewed the now quiet fighting ground, soaked by the rain, which for two days had drenched the country with its fitful showers.This paragraph opens the text that Alexander Gardner wrote to accompany this photograph inGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.Both text and image eloquently capture the war's toll of death and destruction, especially apparent after the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863. Although Gardner's caption identifies the men in the photograph as  rebels represented...without shoes,  they are probably Union dead. During the Civil War, shoes were routinely removed from corpses because supplies were scarce and surviving troops needed them.
The dead shown in the photograph were our own men. The picture represents only a single spot on the long line of killed, which after the fight extended across the fields....The faces all were pale, as though cut in marble, and as the wind swept across the battle-field it waved the hair, and gave the bodies such an appearance of life that a spectator could hardly help thinking they were about to rise to continue the fight.Thus Alexander Gardner vividly described the aftermath of the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, where Timothy O'Sullivan photographed the fallen Union dead. General Reynolds was killed during the battle and had already been removed from the field. O'Sullivan made the photograph while working for Gardner, who printed the image and included it in hisGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.
Timothy O'Sullivan's darkroom wagon, pulled by four mules, entered the frame at the right side of the photograph, reached the center of the image, and abruptly U-turned, heading back out of the frame. Footprints leading from the wagon toward the camera reveal the photographer's path. Made at the Carson Sink in Nevada, this image of shifting sand dunes reveals the patterns of tracks recently reconfigured by the wind. The wagon's striking presence in this otherwise barren scene dramatizes the pioneering experience of exploration and discovery in the wide, uncharted landscapes of the American West.O'Sullivan's photographs from the 1867 Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel expedition were intended to provide information for the purpose of expanding railroads and industry, yet they demonstrate his eye for poetic beauty.
In 1873 Timothy O'Sullivan led a splinter group from Lieutenant George Wheeler's geological expedition to Zuni Pueblo in northeast Arizona and to the pre-Columbian cliff dwellings known as the White House Ruins at Caon de Chelle, mostly dating from the eleventh century. O'Sullivan was one of the first people to photograph the structures nestled in the canyon wall.Above the architectural forms, the monumental striated rock formation hovers illogically where the sky should be. O'Sullivan, photographing from a great distance, conveyed the sense of overwhelming scale. Along with the two tiny figures standing at the left center, the photograph's original caption, which identifies the location as:  In a Niche 50 feet above Present Caon Bed,  provides a measure of scale.
With the turn of a key in the small hole in the table's side, the top automatically slides back and the drawer below opens, revealing lidded compartments and a book rest. The mechanism is activated by interior springs, which are tightened by winding another key.Jean-Franois Oeben, thebnistewho made this table, was a particularly talented maker of mechanical furniture and was given the special privilege to forge his own metal fittings. He specialized in elaborate, multi-purpose pieces of furniture that he decorated with floral marquetry of stained woods. On this table a naturalistic bouquet of tulips, daffodils, roses, and other flowers spreads across the top surface, loosely tied with a ribbon. Originally the marquetry was vibrantly dyed, but the colors have faded and only the green shades remain.
Anbnisteused various brilliantly colored exotic woods and stained native woods to create the floralmarquetryon the doors of these corner cupboards.bnistesspecializing in this type of work, such as Jean-Franois Oeben, sometimes sold such panels already made and ready to be glued onto a piece of furniture.Oeben used the grain of the wood to create the effect of movement in a leaf or a petal. Tulips, carnations, roses, lilies, and daffodils are recognizable in hisnaturalisticbouquets. Elaborategiltbronzemountsof interlaced flowers and branches, designed by a specialized sculptor and made by a bronze caster, set off the marquetry panels.
When unlocked, the top of this small table may be slid back, revealing a drawer covered with a sliding lidveneeredwithmarquetry. By pressing a button, the sliding lid releases, showing silk-lined compartments that may once have held writing materials and various pots for powder, rouge, and beauty patches. This table would probably have been placed in the bedroom, where it would serve for both dressing and writing.The fine floral marquetry on the top of the table is characteristic of the work of Jean-Franois Oeben, a royalbniste.The naturalistically arranged bouquet represented on the top surface contains various flowers including roses, tulips, and daffodils. A garland of blossoms appears to hang from a grill above. At the four corners, a lion, a swan, a dove, and a salamander represent the four elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. Thetrellismarquetry around the sides of the table and floral marquetry on top are formed from small pieces of wood dyed in various shades, including blue and green, all of which are now almost completely faded.
Although thebnisteJean-Franois Oeben produced a number of similar commodes, this one's unusually short legs and shallow depth indicate that he probably made it for a specific location. The gilt-bronzemountswithmotifsdrawn from ancient Greece made it acommode  la grecque(in the Grecian style). Collectors at the forefront of fashion, such asMadame de Pompadour,Louis XV'smistress, admired theparquetryand the laurel leaves andguillochemotifs drawn fromclassical antiquity.As he did in other works, Oeben fitted this commode with an ingenious locking mechanism, using one lock to control the whole commode. The side drawers in thefriezecannot be opened unless the center drawer has been pulled out slightly. A metal rod at the back of the drawer is then released, allowing the sides to be opened smoothly. Each of these drawers opens with circular pulls, cleverly corresponding to the guilloches in the gilt-bronze frieze.
Drops of blood are visible on Christ's brow as he carries the cross to his Crucifixion. The immediacy of this close-up image invites the viewer to contemplate the pain and meaning of Christ's sacrifice.Associated with Leonardo da Vinci, Marco d'Oggiono subtly manipulated light and shadow in this work to heighten the impression of Christ's patient submission to his fate.Images of Christ carrying the cross were extremely popular in northern Italy in the late 1400s. Oggiono made this painting and others like it for the purpose of private devotion.
With his head tilted back, his mouth open as if singing, and his arms thrown out in dramatic gesturing, the man on this vase shows the effects of a long night of drinking. He appears unaware of his surroundings or even his full bladder. Luckily, a servant-boy is there, anticipating his master's needs. The boy stands patiently carrying his master's belongings--a walking stick and a basket covered with a cloth--and holds out a jug for him to urinate into. Many Greek vases were designed for use atsymposia, or drinking parties. Vase-painters frequently depicted the physical effects of indulgence, from over-stretched bladders to upset stomachs. Since symposia were aristocratic events, faithful servants often appear, shepherding the revelers through their difficulties.The decoration on this vessel is particularly appropriate. This special form ofoinochoe, called a chous, was used during the Anthesteria, a three-day religious festival in honor ofDionysos, the god of wine. A drinking contest was held on the second day of the festival, and choes were used to hold a standard amount of wine for the contest.
An air of pious reflection permeates the four saints in this initial. The Olivetan Master treats these four figures both as a tightly knit group and as individuals. They are tied together through formal rhythms and echoes. For example, the two figures on the end have their arms crossed and display voluminous sleeves, while the two interior figures have their hands in gestures of prayer and also have almost identical contours along the right shoulder. Although the drapery in a certain sense might be read as one continuousmassof billowing cloth, the individuality of each figure is brought out through color, facial type, and subtle distinctions in gesture and expression. Particularly moving is the figure second from the left who has just turned toward his companion.
Holding a full wineskin, asatyrruns along looking back over his shoulder. Satyrs were half-human creatures and followers ofDionysos, the Greek god of wine. The satyr wears the ivy wreath also associated with human revelers, but his tail and ears show his animal nature.Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use atsymposia, or drinking parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of human revelry and drinking, or, as in this case, with mythological scenes of Dionysos and his satyrs. Only the interior of this cup has painted decoration; plain black glaze covers the outside.
Oltos was an important vase painter specializing in the decoration of bilingual andred-figurecups. He painted both theblack-figureand the red-figure decoration of his bilinguals. Like most of his late bilingual eye-cups, this black-figure tondo bears the inscription,  Memnon is beautiful. The figure painted in the tondo has no distinguishing attributes to aid identification. He is nude, except for a mantle thrown over his left shoulder and right arm. Touches of added red, an old-fashionedmotifused in black-figure and characteristic of Oltos, embellish alternate folds of the mantle, as well as sections of the man's hair and beard. Like the figure in the tondo, the red-figured youth on the exterior of the cup is anonymous, in his case entirely nude except for a purplish added-red wreath around his head.Bilingual vases were developed as a style of vase decoration in Athens around 525 B.C. They combine the two traditional Athenian vase-decoration techniques: the older technique of black-figure, and red-figure, the technique that would gain popularity and continue to be used through the fourth century B.C. On a black-figure vase, silhouettes in black gloss are contrasted against the red-orange clay of the vessel. On a red-figure vase, the forms come from the red-orange color of the clay, and the space around them is filled in with black gloss. Like most bilingual cups, this is an eye-cup, with large eyes painted on the red-figured exterior and a single black figure on the tondo of the interior. Red-figuredpalmettesappear at the handles, and a single red figure occupies the space between the large eyes on one side.
Scenes of nude male revelers and hetairai, or high-class prostitutes, decorate this Athenianred-figurekylixor cup. On the interior of the cup, a reclining hetaira plays kottabos, a popular drinking game atsymposia, or aristocratic drinking parties. The woman slips one handle of a cup over her index finger and tries to flick the dregs from the bottom of the cup at a target some distance away.Related scenes cover the outside of the cup. On one side, another reclining hetaira playskrotala, castanet-like instruments, while one youth offers her a large cup and another youth dances behind her. On the other side, three more youths dance.Scenes of hetairai were a were a popular subject in Greek vase-painting, especially on vases meant to be used at a symposion. For most Athenian men, the only interaction that they would have with women outside their own family was with mistresses or hetairai, who were usually slaves or foreigners. Respectable Athenian women led a very secluded life in which the nudity and frolicking shown on this vase would have been unthinkable.
Asatyr, a semi-human creature of Greek mythology, crawls over a large rocky outcropping toward a sleeping maenad, whom he is about to kiss. The maenad, one of the female followers ofDionysos, the god of wine, reclines on a striped cushion. The wineskin in the background may explain her sound sleep. Filling the interior of this fragmentaryred-figurekylixor cup, this scene of an erotically charged encounter between the human and bestial companions of Dionysos was a particularly fitting decoration for a vessel used at asymposiumor drinking party. Sexual sparring between satyrs andmaenads, the one side pursuing and the other evading, was a favorite theme on symposium vessels. The image of the satyr creeping up on his helpless sleeping prey had a particular appeal. Each side of the exterior of the cup once displayed a figure of a dancing satyr shown in a complex pose. The best preserved of these satyrs is shown from the back; only the profile-view legs, tail, and drinking horn remain of the other.
When Catherine Opie photographed this mini-mall in Silverlake, a Los Angeles neighborhood near downtown, its businesses reflected the bilingual nature of a community that included many Spanish-speaking residents of Mexican and Central American heritage.This is one of seventeen images that make up the series Mini-malls. The large format of both the film negative and the resulting digital print (made from scanning the negative) increases the legibility of details. Signs in a variety of languages underscore the ethnic diversity of Los Angeles's inhabitants and the challenges of immigrant assimilation.  Inspired by the quality of expansiveness that permeates late-nineteenth-century landscape photographs, Catherine Opie began documenting contemporary urban landscapes with a 7 x 17-inch panoramic format camera. Her 1997-98 series of Los Angeles mini-malls focuses on the decidedly unspectacular architecture of strip malls that originated in response to automobile culture and convenience shopping. Photographed at dawn or predawn on weekends with the camera placed parallel to the buildings' facades, the images are devoid of people and cars. Rendered as black-and-white inkjet prints on watercolor paper, they blend elements of nostalgia and romanticism with a deadpan documentary style. These low-slung structures offer the convenience of one-stop shopping, in which beauty salons, video stores, travel agencies, and medical clinics are interspersed with family-owned restaurants and fast-food franchises.

Through both the decoration and mechanism, this clock and its lavishly ornamented case illustrate the latest scientific discoveries at the beginning of the 1700s. The four continents known at this time--Africa, Europe, Asia, and America--adorn the corners of the case. The area below the dial is fitted with a brass grille engraved with geometric designs andallegoricalsymbols corresponding to five of the seven planets known at the beginning of the 1700s: Saturn (Time),Mars(War),Mercury,Venus(Love), andJupiter.The clock and pedestal were originally separate pieces. At some point, Gilles-Marie Oppenord transformed them from a clock on a pedestal (probably made by his father, Alexandre-Jean Oppenordt) to a long-case clock, which kept time more accurately. Craftsmen placed the pendulum and weights of the later movement into a pedestal base and cut an opening into the front to show the pendulum's swing. They then added additional bronzemountsto mask the alterations and to further decorate the piece.Jean-Franois Dominic created the clock's movement. Michel Stollenwerck created the musical movement.

In a tumultuous, windblown scene, five bearded fishermen and six wingedputtihaul a bursting net of fish aboard their boat. One in a series of fivereliefpanels portraying marine scenes, this panel was probably created as part of an ensemble for a state or municipal building with a maritime function.The men's strenuous exertions and the representation of the wind's effects imbue the piece with vitality. Although the stomachs of the putti protrude in the voluptuous curves of high relief, the fishermen's larger muscular figures form a lively series of curves in low relief. The viewer's eye traces over their curved backs and follows their billowing clothing, experiencing the movement of these struggling figures. Reinforcing the action, theFlemishartist Gerard van Opstal carved thealabasterinto small planes that constantly shift directions. These planes break up the surface's solidity and give the work a flickering, watery quality akin to Peter Paul Rubens's effects in paint. This technique is similar to that used for carving smaller-scale works in ivory andboxwood, materials with which van Opstal was trained.
Bernaert Van Orley, the preeminent Netherlandish tapestry designer of the early 1500s, conveyed the prestige and wealth of  his subjects, Count Johan IV of Nassau and his wife, through a number of devices. They wear ornate costumes and their horses wear lavish festival trappings, evoking the pageantry of the late Middle Ages. The encyclopedic inscription in the cartouche at top, the swag, and the coats of arms immediately communicate this couple's elevated status, while the brilliant watercolor heightens the scene's grandeur. Perhaps in reference to the family's vast domains, Van Orley showed a wide expanse of land, including forests, farmlands, and mountains.The Netherlands' royal family commissioned this elaborate drawing for a famous series of tapestries, now destroyed. Called the  Nassau Genealogy,  they depicted the splendor of the lineage of the House of Orange-Nassau from the 1200s to the 1500s. The drawings themselves were considered such major achievements in Van Orley's career that Karel van Mander mentioned the  very beautiful and richly painted cartoons  in his 1604 biography of the artist.
Bearing sacrificial offerings that include a sheep and a ram,worshipers approach a statue ofJupiterat the right. While he took the subject matter andcompositionof the frieze fromclassicalart, Lelio Orsi departed from classicism's characteristic calm and balance by populating the frieze with vigorous, squat figures who sometimes overlap the architecture. The liberal excesses of Orsi's later style are evident in the large-headed, gross-featured youth at right who presents his knifepoint for a woman to touch. Imitating anantiquebas-relief, thereliefis set into a convincing architectural structure with telamones supporting the entablature on either side. Orsi's exaggeratedchiaroscurohelps to achieve the three-dimensional effect. Such sculpturalillusionismdistinguishes his drawings from those of hisManneristcontemporaries. Orsi was well known for his painted decorations on the interiors of buildings, most of which have been destroyed. Scholars know many of his designs forfriezes, similarlysquaredfor transfer, which they have often connected with decorative projects in his hometown of Novellara.
Lurking in the shadows,grotesquemonsters slowly emerge to taunt Saint Anthony. Grinning with satanic delight, the demons take human and animal forms. Unperturbed, Saint Anthony continues to read his meditations. Divine light illuminates his figure, forming a brighthaloaround his head. After his parents' death, thisearly Christianmonkretired to the Egyptian desert to contemplate God. He remained there for fifteen years; during this time he began his legendary combat against the devil, withstanding demonic apparitions and erotic visions. After resisting temptations, Saint Anthony emerged at last from the desert and organized and instructed a group of hermits who sought to imitate his example. Thus he became the father of Christianmonasticism.Lelio Orsi depicted this struggle of good and evil, vividly using light and shadow, loose,painterlybrushwork, and a strong diagonalcomposition. Included in the painting are Saint Anthony's attributes: a tau cross (T-shaped), the pig, and the crutch at his side.
When this cup was filled, the water birds decorating the interior of the lip would have appeared to wade on the shore of the  wine dark sea.  Made by an East Greek potter on the island of Samos inIonia, just off the coast of modern Turkey, thisblack-figurecup is an adaptation of what is known as an Athenian Little Master cup. With a somewhat more delicate form, it differs slightly from the Athenian examples in shape. The cup also follows East Greek traditions in the choice of decorativemotifsand their placement. Water birds were a favorite East Greek motif for centuries. The rosette inside the cup, a motif derived from theNear East, was popular in the art of Samos in this period. The use of a zone of figural decoration on a cup's interior lip is found only on Ionian, not in Athenian, Little Master cups.This cup attests to the international contacts and trade that flourished in the Mediterranean in the 500s B.C. Made in Ionia, the cup adapts an Athenian model; it was eventually shipped toEtruria, where it is said to have been found.
Projecting from a white marblemedallion, the face of the popular octogenarian Pope Alexander III looks out with informal candor. The medallion format, usually reserved for tomb monuments, here was chosen to represent a still-living figure. The pope wears a non-liturgical cap and cape usually worn for informal audiences. His smooth clothing contrasts with his sagging, aging flesh. This un-idealized, casual image is very rare in papal portraiture of the 1600s.Both the base and the double-headed eagle, symbol of the Pope's Ottoboni family, were carved from a single piece ofbigio anticomarble. The sculptor skillfully manipulated the color of the stone so that the white-and-gray veined portion comprised the base while the darker, black-and-gray part of the stone was used for the eagle.The sculpture was a gift fromCardinalFrancesco Barberini, whom Alexander had made a cardinal in 1690.
In Jean-Baptiste Oudry's rendering of a scene from a popular fable, a group of animals gathers to discuss a plague sweeping the land. They decide that nature is punishing them for their sins, and the guiltiest among them should be sacrificed. Each animal describes its own vice, but explains it away. When the innocent but lowly donkey makes a weak case, the powerful beasts turn on him, in the moment illustrated here. The fable's moral is that social standing often determines legal judgment.Oudry often depicted animals in his art. He was especially inspired by poet Jean de La Fontaine'sFables,a popular collection of satires written in the 1600s. Employed as a tapestry designer by day, he worked after hours over a five-year period to produce 276 illustrations of the fables. The drawings are rich in contrast, with dark ink and whiteheighteningon blue paper. Oudry rendered them in meticulous detail, with loose and inventive brushwork. He eventually sold the drawings, which were published in a luxury edition of La Fontaine'sFablesin 1755.
An eagle and a magpie meet while flying over a field. The eagle invites the magpie to join him on his flight across the countryside, but cautions her to say only good things because other birds may overhear them. Disregarding the warning, the Magpie chats away and offers to share gossip, which offends the eagle. Jean-Baptiste Oudry's rendition of the tale shows the eagle flying away from the magpie. The moral of the fable is that in the company of others, it is necessary to be discreet with words.Oudry often depicted animals in his art. He was especially inspired by poet Jean de La Fontaine'sFables,a popular collection of satires written in the 1600s.

A fox, tired of eating chicken, asks a wolf how to hunt larger animals. The wolf teaches the fox to disguise himself as a wolf, and together they stalk a herd of sheep. The shepherd flees with his flock, leaving behind a sacrificial lamb. For his illustration of the tale, Jean-Baptiste Oudry chose the moment when the lamb figures out the plot. To the wolf's dismay, the lamb fools the fox by directing it to chase a rooster. The fable's moral is that to change one's basic nature is impossible.Though he worked as a tapestry designer, Oudry labored in his spare time over a five-year period to produce 276 illustrations for Jean de La Fontaine'sFables,a popular collection of satires written in the 1600s. Oudry's drawings were published in a luxury edition of theFablesin 1755.
This drawing by Jean-Baptiste Oudry illustrates a fable by poet Jean de La Fontaine. The fable is based on a myth told in Niccol Machiavelli's novelMandragola.Pluto, the ruler of the underworld, sits above his subjects in the fiery depths ofHades; the demon Belphagore stands before him. As the drawing shows, he is about to send Belphagore to earth to find the answer to an eternal question: whether spouses influence their mates to sin. In the guise of a rich merchant, Belphagore forces a woman to marry him. She is in love with another man, however, and escapes with him. Even after Belphagore disguises himself again and tries to seduce her, she stays virtuous.Employed as a tapestry designer by day, Oudry worked after hours over a five-year period to produce 276 illustrations for De La Fontaine'sFables.The drawings are rich in contrast, with dark ink and whiteheighteningon blue paper.

Before the total destruction of the gardens of Arcueil, [Jean-Baptiste Oudry] never failed to go and draw there whenever he had a moment's leisure.... One could always find people sketching, and everyone eagerly consulted M. Oudry; in these picturesque pastimes he excelled like an instructor in his class.Thus wrote Oudry's biographer in the 1800s. Many of Oudry's nearly fifty large-scale park scenes from between 1744 and 1747 depict these gardens of Arcueil, at the Prince de Guise's chateau near Paris, which were destroyed not long after. Oudry's landscape drawings, of which approximately one thousand still exist, combine a love of nature; a free, rapid drawing style; and a sensitivity to the effects of light.Here Oudry used white chalk sparingly for subtlehighlightson the tan paper. He created depth with a strong receding diagonal line and black chalk markings ranging from the darkforegroundto the lighter areas of the sky. Scholars are uncertain whether Oudry or a later artist added the figures.
In theforeground, weeds grow without restraint, and unpruned trees and shrubs creep upward on the brokentrellis. At the center of thecomposition, light falls through the arch and onto the dilapidated steps. Through the arch, a stairway overtaken with vegetation leads upward, disappearing into thebackground. At the bottom of the stairs, a loose stack of stones topples to its side. This neglected and forgotten garden imparts a melancholy sense of loss and decay. In this view of an overgrown, abandoned garden, Jean-Baptiste Oudry conveyed his mastery ofchiaroscuro. This drawing is one in a large series of over one hundred studies that Oudry made between 1744 and 1747 of the abandoned gardens of the Prince de Guise's chteau at Arceuil, France.
This photograph was carefully composed to both obscure and reveal the model's body. Given the battery of lights and equipment required to make the exposure, it is unlikely that the figure is actually showering; rather, she is a model evoking the pleasure of doing so. Note the pale gold reflections of the studio lights on the shiny surface of the plastic, an effect that required masterful lighting skills.
Despite my considerable experience in the field of photography, I was for a long time unsure whether I would ever succeed in producing a good carbro print. Many of these pictures were produced with considerable technical difficulties unknown to today's users of more recent and much simpler color materials. Each shot cost $150, and many hours of work were necessary to produce it. Three different shots with varying exposures had to be made with three different color filters. After this, three separate color images each one thousandth of an inch thick had to be transferred onto paper one by one and precisely superimposed one on top of the other.--Paul OuterbridgePaul Outerbridge described the practical and technical concerns with making this image, but what of the aesthetic impulse  The photograph has been cropped from the full negative, which included the model's face and slightly more of both arms, to this disturbing image of a woman piercing her own breast and abdomen with the sharp tips of meat packer's gloves. Although Outerbridge described the arduous carbro process, this photograph contains very subdued color. The realistic representation of flesh tone, however, and the lack of pubic hair--it was airbrushed out--make the nude subject even more shocking.
Paul Outerbridge probably made this image of a single-family suburban home, symbol of the American dream, as a part of an advertisement for a construction company. Set back from the street with a generous lawn and newly planted trees, the homes in this development would have greatly appealed to young families who were looking to retreat from congested urban centers such as Chicago and New York in the 1930s. The blue sky with billowy white clouds completes the presentation of a serene suburb.Outerbridge may never have intended for this image to be seen on its own. He actually used the photograph as part of a secondcomposition, entitledTools with Blueprint.
Paul Outerbridge actually used a picture of a picture in thiscompositionthat includes a house under construction, tools, and a blueprint. Partly framed by two-by-fours, the picture of the home on the left creates the illusion of a window opening onto a pleasant suburban neighborhood. The vertical and horizontal two-by-fours convey a sense of strength, suggesting the solid security of a well built home. He probably made this image as an advertisement for a construction company.In the 1930s, the most practical way to create quality color photographs like this was by employing the carbro color process. This method is extremely labor intensive, requiring patience and precision. Outerbridge consistently and expertly employed this technique. As a result, the colors in his photographs are as descriptive today as they were sixty years ago.
 Sunday afternoon, we get it together. I cook the steaks and my wife makes the salad.  These words, written by the man in a chef's hat with his arm around his smiling spouse, seem to express immense satisfaction in a humble ritual: the backyard barbeque.This photograph is part of the seriesSuburbia(1972), which depicts the rituals and lifestyles of San Francisco East Bay residents in the late '60s and early '70s. With clearly conceived notions of Americans--at work and at play, indoors and out, in family and in social groups--Owens's intention was neither to criticize nor parody the conformity and materialism he witnessed in middle-class America. Instead, he enabled his subjects to speak for themselves. Using medium-format cameras outfitted withwide-angle lensesand fill-in flash, Owens involved his friends, relatives, and neighbors in the project not only by photographing them, but also by asking them to record their comments on cards, which he included as captions in the book.
Bill Owens's photograph of a housewife and her children doesn't simply illustrate the caption she provided. Instead, it provides a wry counterpoint to--and yet incorporates all of the inherent contradictions in--her words.  I believe in women's liberation. I'm tired of the image of the woman who has the most sanitary toilet bowl, the cleanest floor and the brattiest kids as the supermother. I want to be able to change with my children and to change with my life as I grow older. Staying at home and taking care of the kids doesn't help.  The woman sits contentedly on a couch in her bathrobe, feeding her baby as her other young child watches television. A stylized portrait of a woman hung over the fireplace seems to symbolize the feminist viewpoint she alludes to.This photograph is part of the seriesSuburbia(1972), which depicts the rituals and lifestyles of San Francisco East Bay residents in the late '60s and early '70s. With clearly conceived notions of Americans--at work and at play, indoors and out, in family and in social groups--Owens's intention was neither to criticize nor parody the conformity and materialism he witnessed in middle-class America. Instead, he enabled his subjects to speak for themselves. Using medium-format cameras outfitted withwide-angle lensesand fill-in flash, Owens involved his friends, relatives, and neighbors in the project not only by photographing them, but also by asking them to record their comments on cards, which he included as captions in the book.
This three-partaltarpiecedepicts the visionary experiences of the layman Chiarito del Voglia, who commissioned it in the 1340s. The central panel--executed ingildedgessoreliefand showing the apostles receiving communion through narrow tubes emanating from Christ's navel--is most unusual in subject matter and medium.The left wing displays scenes from Christ's Passion, the events leading up to hisCrucifixion. In an unusual addition, three scenes below the main panel feature the bearded donor Chiarito participating in theMass. In the central scene, he participates in the communion of the Apostles shown above by means of a tube that extends down to his mouth.On the right wing in the bottom panel, Chiarito, seen standing alone, listens to amonkpreaching to an audience. His powerful vision is made manifest in the scene above. He imagines the blood ofChristflowing down from the Trinity, shown in the top panel, to bathe the crowd below. Diagonal lines on the pulpit direct the viewer's eyes to the flowing blood.
This miniature depicts the Ascension, Christ's appearance on earth after the Resurrection when his apostles witness him being taken to heaven. Christ is shown as an object of veneration, like a cult statue, purposefully separated from the other figures in the narrative. All of the other participants direct their attention toward him--even the angels with instruments who appear along the sides. The two kneeling figures in the border below, who also gaze in adoration up at Christ, are members of the Compagnia di Sant'Agnese, a group of pious laypeople (both men and women) who met at the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. The manuscript from which this leaf comes was a laudario, a hymnal used by the group in their public devotions. The hymn for the feast of the Ascension begins below the miniature.The miniature's artist, Pacino di Bonaguida, was well known in Florence for his devotional paintings. Here he has focused attention on the figure of Jesus, who is isolated at the center of the image. Christ's robes of brilliant yellow and white, however, make him less substantial than the figures below and at the same time, more radiant, absorbed into the brightness of the gold surrounding him, as he ascends to heaven.
At the center of this miniature, Saint Lawrence, a Roman deacon who lived during the third century A.D., endures torture on a flaming grill during his martyrdom as several Roman soldiers and two judges look on. At the upper right, two angels lift Saint Lawrence's soul up to heaven where God receives him with open arms. This scene was painted by Pacino di Bonaguida, one of the leading Florentine artists of the early 1300s. This miniature demonstrates Pacino's characteristic palette of rich blue, bright orange, and acid yellow, as well as his compositional creativity.This miniature comes from a laudario, a type of manuscript filled with lauds, or songs of praise, written in Italian and used by pious lay communities. This laudario was commissioned by a group of worshippers called the Compagnia di Sant'Agnese that sang the hymns in this manuscript at the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence.
In this easily comprehensible scene, theVirgin Maryand her mother Anne hold theChristChild, probably observed by Mary's husbandJosephand her father Joachim. But the identity of the two older people remains debatable: some scholars speculate that they might be Biblical prophets, who lived long enough to see the Christ Child as God had promised them.Joseph Paelinck stressed the humanity of theHoly Familyin this moment of peace and intimacy. His simple, orderlycompositiongives equal attention to each of the individual figures. Thedeviceof the draped wall encloses the space and intensifies the viewer's focus on the interaction among the large, idealized figures. Elements such as the dramatic lighting and the sharply articulated folds of drapery show Paelinck's admiration of Jacques-Louis David'sNeoclassicalstyle.
Asphinxholding a pomegranate branch, a bull, birds, and a man grasping the bull by one horn decorate this Mycenaean sieve jar. With its strainer spout, this jar would have been used for wine or any other liquid that might contain particles needing filtering.Most decoration on Mycenaean pottery consisted of extremely stylizedmotifsof marine or floral origin. Around 1400 B.C., however, artists, probably inspired by wall painting, developed a less common pictorial style of pottery decoration. Bulls were frequent subjects on this pictorial pottery, and the man grasping the bull by the horn on this jar may be a bull jumper. Bull jumping, a ritual performance that originated in the Minoan culture on Crete, involved literally grabbing the horns of a bull and somersaulting over its back. If this man was a bull jumper, the sphinx and the pomegranates may indicate an unsuccessful leap resulting in his death, since they had funerary connotations in later Greek art.Most Mycenaean pictorial pottery has been found in the eastern Mediterranean, especially onCyprus. In the 1300s and 1200s B.C., Mycenaean Greeks exerted a strong influence over Cyprus. Scholars are not certain whether Mycenaean pictorial pottery found on Cyprus was imported or made there, either by immigrant Mycenaean potters or by Cypriot potters under Mycenaean influence.
Intended as a grave offering, this Athenian white-ground lekythos depicts family members visiting a loved one's grave. A youth, standing at the left, ties fillets or ribbons around thesteleor grave marker. On the right, a girl, her hair cut short as a gesture of mourning, holds an alabastron, a small oil vessel, and a flower. The grave itself appears as a high mound marked by a tall, thin stele. In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape, the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual, and the decoration on the vessel shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well, but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.
A young woman and a youth face each other over a low stool on this Athenian white-ground lekythos. The youth hands the woman an egg, which functions in Greek art as both a love gift and a symbol of rebirth. The scene surely depicts a family preparing for a funeral, since the woman holds a fillet or wide ribbon in her hand. Long fillets were tied around tombstones as a part of funerary ritual.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessel shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes.

In the mythological battles of the Greeks, the conflict did not end when a warrior killed his opponent. There was then a struggle over the corpse. The victorious warrior would try to strip the armor from the fallen opponent and perhaps mutilate the body or hold it for ransom, while the fallen soldier's comrades tried to win back the body.The front of this Athenianblack-figureneck-amphora shows such a conflict. In the center of the scene, two warriors battle over a corpse, stripped of all its armor except for the helmet and shield. A similar scene appears to the left. To the right, a warrior chases a fleeing opponent. The scene on the back of the vase shows a group of warriors flanked by riders and onlookers, and a procession of galloping horsemen decorates the shoulder on both sides of the vase.
The excessive mourning of the mythological figure Niobe decorates thisApulianred-figureloutrophoros.Niobe'sfoolish boasting led to the slaughter of her fourteen children by the godsApolloandArtemis. For nine days and nights, she mourned, ignoring family members' attempts to comfort her. Finally,Zeustook pity on Niobe's grief and turned her to stone. On this vase, Niobe stands in a funerarynaiskossurrounded by four attendants holding grave offerings. Her brother Pelops drives up in his chariot with his bride Hippodameia to urge her to stop grieving. By painting the lower part of her dress white, the painter indicated Niobe slowly turning to stone from the feet up. The back of the vase also depicts a funerary naiskos flanked by attendants and containing a large funerary lekythos. Both the structure and the vessel are painted white to represent stone.Loutrophoroi, made of both terracotta and marble, were placed as markers on the graves of the unwed. In the scene on the front, two loutrophoroi flank Niobe. The one on the right with figural decoration is the same form as this vase. As these painted depictions show, this terracotta loutrophoros would originally have been placed on a stand.
With elaborate scenes on both sides, thisloutrophorosor ritual vase is characteristic of the work of vase painters in southern Italy around 330 B.C. The multilevelcompositionon one side shows successive moments in one of the godZeus'smany seductions of a mortal woman. At the bottom, Zeus in the form of a swan approachesLeda. Above, Zeus meets withAphrodite, the goddess of love, presumably enlisting her help for the seduction. Both episodes are surrounded bypersonifications. The vase's other side displays a woman in anaiskos, a small open building, surrounded by attendants.  Beginning in the 600s B.C., Greeks colonized parts of southern Italy and Sicily. From about 450 B.C., these colonists began producing their own fine, decorated pottery, which eclipsed the imported Athenian wares by the 300s B.C. This pottery, known as South Italian, grew directly out of Athenian shapes, style, and subject matter. The colonists quickly developed their own variations, inventing new shapes, finding their own styles, and depicting subjects not otherwise found in Greek art. Scholars divide South Italian pottery into regional schools of production, the largest of which isApulian.
Dionysos, the god of wine, stands calmly in the midst of a group of dancingmaenadsandsatyrson this Athenianblack-figurecolumn-krater. Wearing a festive wreath of ivy leaves and holding his drinking horn, the god appears unaffected by the frenzy of his companions. Scenes with Dionysos were a favorite decoration for vessels like this column-krater, which would have been used at a symposion or drinking party to mix the wine with water.On the other side of the vase, two lions ravage a bull. The motif of the lion attack was central to Greek art and literature from the 800s through the 500s B.C. and served as a metaphor for heroic or even divine triumph. It was referenced in a wide variety of contexts, from the epic poems ofHomer, to the sculpture on monumental temples, to the decoration on vases made for private use, such as this one.Plantmotifsdecorate the rim of the vessel. Ivy leaves cover the outer edge, andlotusbuds encircle the top. The bearded heads on the handle-plates were a typical decoration for column-kraters.
The Greek godDionysosappears on thisApulianred-figurecup in his role as the god of theater. An actor costumed as a phlyax and holding a wreath stands before Dionysos. The god sits on a chair with a cloak wrapped around his legs holding aphiale, or offering dish, which contains three white objects, perhaps eggs. The term phlyax is used for both farces parodying the heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life and for the actors who performed them. These plays were popular in the 300s and 200s B.C. in the Greek colonies in Italy. The term phlyax probably derives from the Greek verb  to swell  and finds its meaning in the actor's costume of a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus. On the outside of this cup, set on a low disk foot, a seated woman holding another phiale with eggs faces a kneelingErosholding a fillet or ribbon. On the other side, a similar scene is depicted. A nude boy kneels before a woman holding a phiale and a mirror.This cup represents a change in the theatrical scenes that were so popular on South Italian pottery. About 360 B.C., painters shifted from depicting scenes from plays to alluding to the theater by showing either an actor or Dionysos.
As these two figures gaze longingly at each other and the couple falls in love, the fate of a generation of Greek andTrojanwarriors is sealed. On this Athenianred-figurelekythos, the artist depicted the moment when Paris, the Trojan prince, meetsHelen, the wife of hishostMenelaos, the king ofSparta. Helen will run off with Paris, sparking theTrojan War. Paris and Helen meet in the palace at Sparta, whose lavish setting is indicated by the elaborate doors with raisedreliefknockers. Helen's companions frame the scene; one seems rather amazed to see a tiny version ofAphrodite, the goddess of love, blessing the union as she flies through the air in a chariot drawn byerotes. A lekythos was a container used for precious perfumed oils. Because it had a narrow neck, the oil poured out slowly and the cup-like mouth served as a funnel for filling the vessel.
The Panathenaia, a state religious festival, honoredAthena, the patron goddess of Athens. Held in its expanded form every four years, the festival included athletic, musical, and other competitions. Amphorae filled with oil pressed from olives from the sacred trees of Athena were given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. These amphorae had a special form with narrow neck and foot and a standard fashion of decoration. One side showed Athena, the goddess of war, armed and striding forth between columns, and included the inscription  from the games at Athens.  The other side showed the event for which the vase was a prize. Leading vase-painters, commissioned by the state, decorated these vessels, which continued to be decorated in theblack-figure techniquelong after it had gone out of fashion for other vases, probably due to religious conservatism. The same conservatism applied to the depiction of Athena.On this example, the figure of Athena is portrayed in anArchaisticor old-fashioned style. TheNikefigures atop akanthos columns flanking Athena are a detail that allows scholars to date this vase precisely to 363 2 B.C. The back of the vase depicts Nike, the goddess of victory, crowning the winner of a boxing match between young men, while an older, bearded judge looks on. The leather thongs held by the youths identify them as boxers; they were wrapped around the hands and served as the ancient equivalent of boxing gloves. In 370 B.C. the victor in youth boxing won forty amphorae of oil; the second place winner took home eight.
One side of this vase shows the Judgment ofParis, a myth with a long history in Greek art. The youngTrojanprince Paris sits amid three goddesses and their guideHermes, god of travelers. Paris's task is to decide which goddess is the most beautiful:Hera, queen of the gods;Athena, goddess of wisdom; orAphrodite, goddess of love. But this was no mere beauty contest. Paris chose Aphrodite because her bribe was the best: He could have whomever among mortal women he thought most beautiful. His choice ofHelen, queen ofSparta, was the ultimate cause of theTrojan War. The other side of the vase depicts a battle of Greeks andAmazons, a favorite theme for vase painters in this period.The bold use of color, raisedreliefareas, andgildingon this vase is typical of theKerch Styleof Athenianred-figurevase painting, named for an area on the Black Sea coast of southern Russia where many of these vases were found. Thepelikewas a favorite shape for Athenian vase painters of the 300s B.C.
Bands of animals, including lions, panthers, bulls, boars, sphinxes, goats, a ram, and a swan, decorate this Corinthian black-figure oinochoe or jug. With their added colors against the light background, they serve a decorative rather than a narrative role. Rosettes fill the areas between the animals. The use of large areas of incised polychrome decoration such as the tongues or the scale pattern on the shoulder of this vase is typical of Corinthian pottery in the period from 640 to 625 B.C.The oinochoe was part of the standard Greek table service for the mixing and serving of wine. This one has a pinched spout to facilitate pouring.
Fourfriezesof animals decorate the body of thisCorinthianblack-figureolpe, or pitcher. The rows of slowly moving animals--lions, panthers, goats, deer, bulls, boar, swan--are typical choices for a Corinthian vase-painter in the second half of the 600s B.C. Rosettes surround and separate the animals. The animals and filling ornament are carefully drawn, and the vase-painter applied a large amount of added red color, which contrasts with the black of the glaze and the whitish color of the clay.The olpe was a favorite vessel in this period among Corinthian vase-painters. In the early 600s B.C., Corinthian potters and vase-painters discovered theblack-figure techniqueof pottery decoration. This new Corinthian pottery, with its simple and repetitive yet visually attractive and colorful decoration, completely took over the pottery market and was widely exported throughout the Mediterranean.
Like a variation upon a theme, these two terracotta busts subtly contrast with each other: one woman looks up, the other down, one turns to the right, the other to the left, but neither woman meets the viewer's eyes. Sculptor Augustin Pajou modeled the busts with a striking simplicity. Their faces are modeled in smooth planes, and their hair, loosely tied with a ribbon, is indicated by thinly marked grooves. Pajou was paid 240 livres for these busts, which were designed as models forgiltwood console ornaments on a balcony for the Salle de l'Opra at the royal palace atVersailles. This elaborate theater was being newly renovated in preparation for the wedding of Marie-Antoinette and the Dauphin. The finished wood heads are now lost; they were probably destroyed in a subsequent renovation of the room.
Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom and war, strides forward to protect Painting, Sculpture, Music, Justice, and Medicine, the attributes of which lie at her feet.Augustin Pajou's midsize marble statues were generally intended for wealthy collectors. Scholars believe this piece was originally owned by Duke tienne-Franois de Choiseul, an important member of the French aristocracy and a collector of paintings and prints. Choiseul also had a predilection for refined cabinet sculptures, like Pajou's figure of Minerva, and owned at least two other works by the sculptor. Pajou's accomplished rendering of antiquity, very much consistent with Enlightenment taste in the late 1700s, undoubtedly appealed to Choiseul. The subject of the statuette aptly reflects Choiseul's love of art, his diplomatic skills, and his position as secretary of state for war under the French king Louis XV.
Fluted Doric columns on rectangular pedestals molded withclassicalmotifsform the main structures of this pair of candlesticks. Winged figures and male nudes participate in the design by holding drip pans and candle sockets in their outstretched arms.In 1832, the celebrated Bolognese designer Filippo Pelagio Palagi was selected by King Carlo Alberto of Savoy to redecorate a number of rooms in several of his palaces. The formal style of these candlesticks is in keeping with other metal objects and furniture designed by Palagi, so scholars assume that these pieces originally formed part of the decor of one of palaces.
This lounging bed, once a settee with a back, was ordered by Carlo Alberto on the occasion of his son Vittorio Emanuele's marriage to Maria Adelaide of Habsburg Lorraine in 1842. It was part of a large suite of furniture for Vittorio Emanuele, Duke of Savoy and first king of a united Italy, and his bride for the nuptial apartment in the Palazzo Racconigi outside of Turin. Its form and decoration combine elements from a variety of sources. The palmettes and Ionic capitals come from ancient Greek art, while lotus petals and lion's-paw feet are inspired by Egyptian motifs. The furniture, designed by Filippo Pelagio Palagi, was executed by Gabriele Capello, nicknamed Il Moncalvo, and other craftsmen.The sophisticated inlaid decoration was made using an innovative technique that allowed the craftsmen to quickly create a smooth, uniform surface. The striking upholstery, with its bold patterns and vivid color, is a copy of the original fabric, probably designed by Filippo Pelagio Palagi and hand-woven in Lyon.
A gathering of deities decorates the front of thisred-figurevolute-krater, made in a Greek colony in the region of Lucania in southern Italy. The twin godsApolloandArtemisoccupy the center of the scene. Apollo holds a kithara, denoting his role as god of music, and Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, is accompanied by her sacred deer. Their motherLetostands at the right. On the left, the godHermesleans on a pillar inscribed with his name, which represents either a boundary marker or a goalpost. Two pairs of youths stand conversing on the back of the vase.The volute-krater was a large serving vessel used to mix wine and water at asymposiumor drinking party. Large symposium vessels like this one began to be produced in the Greek colonies in Italy in the late 400s B.C. Before this time, the colonists had simply imported their fine pottery from Athens, but at this time local painted pottery workshops emerged. Proportionally few vases made in Lucania, the  toe  of Italy, have survived.
A man of many interests and talents, Bernard Palissy developed his distinctive  rustic-ware,  such as this basin, by casting shellfish, plants, and reptiles from life. He then attached them to traditional ceramic forms and decorated these objects with runny, lead-based glazes, increasing their wateryrealism.During his own lifetime, Palissy's works were highly popular. Such influentialpatronsas Anne de Montmorency andCatherine de' Medici, Queen of France, commissioned him to decorate grottoes in their private gardens, settings for diversion and contemplation in the 1500s. Palissy's rustic works were so successful that they were imitated during his own lifetime. In the 1800s, such notable ceramic factories as Svres in France and Wedgwood in England also copied them.
Venus twists on the bed in a curved yet inviting pose, and Mars extends his limbs below, with a putto aiding him to disrobe. The bodies of these mythological lovers respond to each other in their similar anticipatory gestures, creating a dynamic experience of space. The composition's bold diagonal, from the maidservant airing the bedclothes at the top left to Mars's armor at the bottom right, further enhances the scene's sense of drama and spatial depth.Palma Il Giovane perpetuated many elements of Tintoretto's style, such as the sexual magnetism that galvanizes this entire canvas. Palma painted few mythological subjects, probably for a small circle of his intellectual friends. The poet Giambattista Marino spent time in Venice from 1606 to 1607, and Palma may have painted this canvas for him.
In the boat to the left stand Sir Guyon and the palmer, a pilgrim holding a palm branch who has returned from the Holy Land. Phaedria stands in the boat to the right, gesturing across the Idle Lake to the Enchanted Isle on the right, replete with dancing nymphs glittering in the evening sun. The subject is adapted from a passage in the Faerie Queene, a poem first published in 1590 by the English writer Edmund Spenser. In the poem, however, Phaedria refused, much against Sir Guyon's wishes, to take the palmer as well, and he was left behind on the bank. In Samuel Palmer's adaptation, the palmer is included, presumably intended as an autobiographical reference.From the start, Samuel Palmer conceived this English Romantic narrative as a work of art in its own right. This visionary and idealized landscape is a highly finished and virtuoso display of his achievements with watercolor. From the dappled clouds to the melting sunlight that modulates all that it envelops, the range of technique is extraordinary. Much of the work was done with the point of the brush.
Giovanni Paolo Panini probably made this study of three men in varied poses to provide figure types for his views of Rome, calledvedute.Although he usually focused on elaborate architecture, he gave a sense of scale and humanity to his scenes by adding numerous small figures performing various tasks.Panini drew these figures very quickly with thick black chalk lines, later adding gray wash in a range of strengths. He first lightly sketched in the overall form of the central figure, then added layers of wash to define the creases in his breeches and jacket. The darkest washes represent the shadows.
Achilles, dressed in women's clothing, holds a shield while admiring a sword. Based on ancient legend, Achilles' mother, knowing that her son would die if he fought in the Trojan War, disguised him as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes' household, where he lived among the king's daughters. When war threatened, Ulysses and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch him, knowing they had to trick him into revealing himself. Cunningly, they deposited a heap of gifts before the women: jewelry, clothes, and other finery, but also a sword and shield. When it came time to select from the gifts, Achilles instinctively grasped the weapons, thus revealing his true identity.Pietro Paolini placed his figures in a dark, shallow space, dramatically lighting the figure of Achilles. Additional highlightsilluminatethe faces of the other figures and pick out the shiny jewelry and weapons. The youthful, smooth complexions of Achilles and the king's daughters contrast with the aged, wrinkled appearances of Lycomedes and his wife.
This virtuoso carving, produced from a single plank of limewood, demonstrates the accomplished skills of its maker, Aubert Parent, who came to prominence in 1777 when one of his panels was accepted as a gift by Louis XVI, king of France. The relief shows a vase of flowers, including poppies, roses, lilac, lilies-of-the-valley, and daisies, on a plinth. Parent used various levels of carving to make the design seem more lifelike. For example, the flattened  carved  acanthus leaves on the vase contrast sharply with the  real  leaves of the roses and grapevine surrounding it. Parent once noted that the delicate lilac blossoms in particular were extremely difficult to carve, as they had to be worked from both above and below without breakage.The lower part of the scene--a pair of birds defending their nest from a grass snake and a slug--alludes to parental responsibility and, indirectly, to the duty of the French monarchy toward its subjects at the beginning of the French Revolution.
In response to the tumultuous political events of theFrench Revolution, Aubert Parent created thisallegoryof the French monarchy and the drafting of the new constitution by the National Assembly. On September 14, 1791,Louis XVItook an oath to support the new political regime. Parent'srelief, carved from a single piece of limewood, links amedallionof the Roman EmperorHadrian, symbolizing the French king, with a medallion of the Roman Senate, representing the National Assembly. The dead bird (the old regime) and the unguarded nest (France) symbolize the failure of the new constitution and the end of the monarchy.
Pierre-Adrien Pris studied and drew these ancient Roman tables, stools, ewers, and lighting devices while on a visit to a Roman museum. He based the chair with thesphinxeson a Pompeian wallfresco. He made many such drawings in preparation for illustrations in a book titledVoyage pittoresque; ou Descriptions des royaumes de Naples et de Sicile(A Picturesque Voyage; or Descriptions of the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily), published in 1783. Designers copied these images to furnish the homes of clients eager for rooms in the style ofPompeii.Although scholars had studiedclassicalremains with great interest since theRenaissance, they could not obtain accurate information about them before the 1770s without actually visiting Italy or Greece. By that time, printed reproductions of actual classical wall decoration and furniture made on the spot began to appear, providing a fertile source of inspiration for both painters and craftsmen. In the past, artists had created objects and designs based on strange blends of ancientmotifsand newly invented ones. Now, with direct copies of actual objects available to a wider market, a new demand arose for more authentic classically inspired interiors.
Renowned for the austere remoteness of his Mannerist paintings, Parmigianino nonetheless created drawings that display dynamic energy and human warmth. He used self-discipline to transform his initial passionate concepts from the freedom and rhythms of sheets like this to the famed glacial grace of his panel paintings. An instinctive and prolific draftsman, he often covered both sides of sheets with varied figures and themes.Scholars generally connect the drawings on the recto--Saint John the Baptist, Saint Jerome, a crucifix seen from the side, and several heads--with Parmigianino's famous altarpiece, theVision of Saint Jeromein the National Gallery of Art in London. Parmigianino may also have drawn these figures as a compositional study for a similar, earlier altarpiece that was either lost or never made. The verso includes a standing Christ Child, another crucifix, and a large, handsome greyhound that appears in a paintingfrom about 1523.
Even as he sleeps, this naked Saint Jerome ripples with energy, as does his billowing blanket. Coupled with his quick, fertile imagination, Parmigianino's mastery of pen, ink, wash, and heightening gives this rendering a refreshing spontaneity. The artist crafted the dynamic composition from lively, fluid, yet never superfluous lines and modulated the wash with the touch of a brush for lighter or darker tones. He used white heightening, which can easily overpower a drawing, in a precise, economical, and balanced manner.Parmigianino made this drawing in preparation for an altarpiece,The Vision of Saint Jerome, of about 1526, now in London's National Gallery, but the painted figure ended up less powerful and older than this vigorous creature. His study of  monumental ancient sculpture and Michelangelo's art led to this figure's expansiveness and muscularity.A later collector may have cut the sheet at the top, eliminating parts of the head and arms.
Parmigianino crammed two interlocking studies of theHoly Family, one drawn upside down from the other, onto this sheet of paper. At the bottom, the Madonna sits on the ground holding her right breast, while a female attendant beside her holds theChristChild. When the sheet is turned the other way up, a variant of the same group appears, this time including theMadonna and Child, perhaps withSaint Elizabethand the infant John the Baptist.The two studies overlap at the center, showing how rapidly yet harmoniously the artist's train of thought sprang from one study to the other. The heads interlock across the middle of the sheet, and the bodies seem to mirror each other. Parmigianino then made his choice between the two, reinforcing with brush and wash thechiaroscuroin the more fully resolved one. An early drawings collector probably cut the sheet from a larger leaf of studies.Parmigianino almost certainly made these studies in preparation for a print ofThe Adoration of the Shepherds.
Parmigianino made this drawing and many others in preparation for his most famous painting, theMadonna of the Long Neck. With that painting, he ventured to extremes in molding the human body to create an image of grace and beauty. These studies demonstrate the freedom of his penwork and his fertile thought process in experimenting with a variety of poses before settling on his elegant final solution.On the recto, Parmigianino explored how to position the Madonna and Child together, focusing on the Christ Child's pose. The baby here has curly hair and open eyes that suggest a liveliness absent in the finished work.The upper left corner of the sheet's verso contains a study for the Virgin's head. She appears with her head tilted downward, as in the painting, but she wears a veil that Parmigianino later discarded. Next to her is a woman in profile who does not appear in the painting. In the lower right corner, Parmigianino drew a study of the temple's entablature and columns, an idea he ultimately omitted.
Parmigianino relied only on line to create gradations of light and shadow and to model his forms. A wide range of hatchings and cross-hatchings unify the drawing. Light diagonal lines create the open atmosphere of the sky, while darker cross-hatching shapes the substantive parts: David's muscular body, his fluttering cape, and the ground behind him.Parmigianino used sure yet delicate contours to define David, but Goliath's head is a mass of wispy, waving lines of beard and hair providing the flimsiest of outlines. He suggested Goliath's sunken eyes with quickly jotted marks and enhanced the thrusting effect of David's dynamic step forward with his billowing cape. The sure ink lines and lack of corrections display the artist's instinctive and prolific draftsmanship.  He had no sooner taken a pen in his hand to learn to write than he began to draw marvelously,  reported his biographer Giorgio Vasari.
Beginning in 1778, the Svres Porcelain Manufactory produced garnitures of five vases to a design called thevases des ges(vases of the ages). These ornamental vases were made in three sizes: a large central vase with handles in the shape of bearded male heads, a pair of smaller vases with heads of young women, and a pair of still smaller vases with heads of boys. In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles. The scenes painted on the fronts of these vases showed episodes fromThe Adventures of Telemachus,one of the king's favorite books. The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Svres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the rpareur, tienne-Henry Bono. The design was created after engravings by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard and after designs by Charles Monnet. tienne-Henri Le Guay gilded the vases.
Bartolomeo Passarotti studied the male nude on this sheet, ingeniously showing the same figure from four sides. Varying the quality of line to achieve his desired effect, he used undulating outlines and distinctive, sharply defined cross-hatching that resembles an engraver's technique. Thicker lines along the outlines and in the body's interior add emphasis in selective areasAs with many Mannerists, Passarotti distorted musculature in order to explore his anatomical interest in powerful, acrobatic figures. He twisted the bodies and omitted the right forearm, adjusting the poses to fit all the views on one sheet and to create a pleasingcomposition. Characteristically, he sketched in some of the feet without much detail and gave only the most summary treatment to the heads. He may have made this drawing simply for study purposes or as part of a book of anatomical studies.
Jean-Baptiste Pater modeled this figure and her voluminous dress with short, hatched lines. The down-to-earth woman reflects his strong interest inFlemishpainting and the Flemish enthusiasm for depictions of the everyday life of common people. Like his mentor Jean-Antoine Watteau, Pater filled notebooks with studies of figures in varied poses and costumes for later use in his paintings. Pater made this characteristic red chalk drawing as a study for a mother and child in a now-lost painting showing troops resting in the countryside.
Nelly Peissachowitz created a kind of self-portrait as a photographer using the crackled and stained tools of her trade. This still-lifecompositionwith photographic developing equipment was probably a student exercise for the Vorkurs. The Vorkurs was a preliminary course that each student completed before becoming an apprentice in one of the specialized workshops such as furniture-making or weaving. It aimed to encourage a creative approach to composition and materials.
The inscription that wraps around this design for a stained-glass window identifies the arms as those of Marcus Belidorus de Casnio, an ancestor of the noble von Paar family. A bare-breasted woman supports the bottom of the family's coat of arms, which is tied to a leafless tree. From its branches hang other elements of their emblems. The crowned bull on the left carries the initialsMBon the end of a sword. The motto hanging from the tree readsStemmata virtuti et munificentie ad avcta. Herov[m] propria(The family trees of heroes grow greater through virtue and munificence), suggesting the continuation of the glory of de Casnio's descendants. A small turreted palace beside a lake in the background displays a specifically Northern European style.To give this scene depth and volume, Georg Pencz combined delicate line drawing with carefully applied washes.
Artists usually illustrated the figure of Justice with attributes of a sword, representing her power, and scales, showing her sense of balance. Paying close attention to her lines and proportions, Georg Pencz drew a powerful female nude in profile. Prominent black chalk lines, diagonal and vertical, indicate his efforts to align various parts of her body. For example, she holds her right hand high to form a diagonal line with her face and right nipple.At first glance, Justice seems to float against a background of fluffy clouds, emphasizing the unbroken silhouette of her form against the empty sky. Her toes, however, project slightly from the picture's bottom frame, as if her feet were firmly balanced on a beam. Pencz's sculptural hatching and cross-hatching suggest he made this design for a print, but no such example is known.
The bearded figure of Joseph of Arimathea carefully lifts Christ's cloth-wrapped body into a sepulcher-his own tomb, recently hewn into a recess in the rocks. Numerous weeping and gesturing figures surround the tomb. The gospel of Saint Matthew vividly describes this scene of Christ's entombment, and Luca Penni closely followed the biblical description.Penni's distinctive style of drawing often accentuated outlines, particularly of facial features. Here he also drew over several faces to emphasize their outlines, such as the profile of the bearded man on the right and the woman with her arms raised. Delicate areas of white heightening form the delicate tufts of grass that hang over the edge of the cave and create highlights on the hair and clothing.
In this depiction of the ancient city's remains, Philippos Margaritis, a native-born Greek, and Philibert Perraud, a Frenchman, photographed the Arch ofHadrianat Athens, a masterpiece ofclassicalarchitecture. The Arch, built around 131 A.D., is a light, elegant structure, with an opening flanked by freestanding columns and a colonnaded upper story. Barely visible beyond the Arch at upper right is the distant mount of the Acropolis.
Elegantly attired and wearing a powdered wig, Charles-Franois Pinceloup de la Grange slightly raises his head and gazes searchingly into the distance. A member of the Orlans nobility, Pinceloup de la Grange had recently received several prestigious government appointments. The painting and a pendant portrait of the sitter's wife may have been intended to celebrate his achievement.The portrait was painted near the outset of Jean-Baptiste Perronneau's career. Primarily working in the medium of pastel, Perronneau was one of the most prominent and accomplished portraitists in eighteenth-century France. He was especially successful in securing patrons, like Pinceloup de la Grange, in the French provinces.
Facing leftward, Magdaleine Pinceloup de la Grange gazes into the distance. Her refined dress is accented by flowers, ribbons, and pearls. But Magdaleine does not appear quite as at ease as her husband, Charles-Franois, in a companion portrait. She sits straight upright, her back parallel to, but not quite touching, the chair behind her.With both hands, Magdaleine grasps a large gray-blue cat that bemusedly engages the viewer. Because of its large size and distinctive coloration, the cat can be identified as achartreux,one of the oldest and most cherished French breeds. Jean-Baptiste Perronneau included feline companions in several of his portraits of female subjects, reinforcing the elegance and sophistication of his sitters. Here, the bells on thechartreux'scollar echo the pearls around Magdaleine's neck, suggesting that cat and sitter alike are refined objects for visual delectation.
The arms ofLouis XV, who came to the throne as a five-year-old in 1715, announce this tapestry's royal origin and purpose. Under the head ofApollo, from whom the sun's rays emanate, a large crown tops a simulated bronze cartouche. Within the cartouche, the three fleurs-de-lis symbolize the arms of France, hanging in the center of an ermine cloak flanked by two military trophies. Suspended medals hang below, in front of the crossed scepter and the  hand of justice,  symbolizing the king's legal power. A royal ceremonial helmet at the bottom seems to rest upon another military trophy. The tapestry's color and design were new, but its celebratory purpose and the specific imagery harked back to the symbols ofLouis XIVfrom the previous reign.The Gobelins tapestry manufactory wove twenty-eight examples of this tapestry over a period of about fifteen years. One of theseportiresdecorated the door of a salon atVersailles, others hung in several of the royal chteaux, and French ambassadors used several to decorate their embassies.
In this intimate portrait of the Holy Family, Joseph leans protectively over the shoulder of the Virgin Mary, who twists around to show him the Christ Child. Baldassare Peruzzi drew the figures so that the viewer seems to be looking up at them, while they in turn look back down at the viewer.Deftly handling the point of the quill, Peruzzi indicated both the lighting and the volume of the forms with a delicate network of hatching and cross-hatching. Numerous lines suggest the wavy strands of Joseph's hair and beard, the Madonna's long, flowing robes, and her strong legs beneath the folds of fabric.A grid in black chalk has been drawn over the figures of the Virgin and Child in order to simplify copying the drawing onto another surface.
Knowing that her son would die if he fought in the Trojan war, Achilles' mother sent him to live with the daughters of King Lycomedes disguised as a woman. Odysseus, hearing that Achilles was there, went to the palace dressed as a merchant. He offered the girls jewelry and clothing but also included a sword, spear, and shield. When a trumpet sounded, Achilles automatically grabbed the weapons, thus revealing his disguise. Here Odysseus stands at the left, inviting the king's daughters into the palace.Baldassare Peruzzi produced this drawing in preparation for one of four oval frescoes in a Roman villa. The drawing's high degree of finish, with no pentimenti, indicates that it may have been used as a modello.
Numerous details indicate that Baldassare Peruzzi made this design for an altar as a presentation drawing, to be shown to a patron for approval. He took great care when drawing the altar's intricate decoration, meticulously outlining the scrolling rinceaux pattern interlaced with animals along the frieze and base of the columns and carefully shading the delicate fluting, dentils, and egg-and-dart motifs. He also showed the effects of shadows on the top and right parts of the altar frame and noted the size of various components on the design so that this large altar could be built with precision.Although this drawing does not relate to any known structure, it probably represents an unexecuted design for a side altar for the cathedral of Siena. Three of the saints in the niches appear facing to the right, toward the main altar, indicating that this altar would have stood in the left aisle.
Capitalizing on the popularity of calling cards in the mid-1800s, the French photographer A.A.E. Disdri seized upon the idea of pasting photographs to small cards. Cheap to produce, the carte-de-visite instantly became a popular form of portraiture during the 1850s and 60s. Images of celebrities and performers were in high demand and it was not unusual for a collector to assemble a group of such cards in one large album. Among the various dancers shown here is the noted ballerina Marie Petipa.
Before the late 1500s when forks came into common use, people ate with their fingers and therefore had to be able to wash their hands at the dining table. Between courses, guests were offered scented water from ewers such as this one to wash their hands, which they held out over shallow basins.Ewers and basins in precious metal were produced mainly for use on important occasions and would at other times be displayed on a buffet at the side of the room. This set was commissioned to commemorate a wedding between the Fuggers, the most illustrious of all German banking families, and the Palffy von Erdds, a famous Hungarian family. Documents in the court archive in Vienna show that the silversmith Abraham Pfleger, one of the most gifted German silversmiths of the late 1500s, produced two sets of ewers and basins on the occasion of the marriage of Maria Fugger to Duke Nikolaus Palffy von Erdd in 1583. This set, dated 1583 on the enameled plaques, is one of those two sets.
A young man grasping his armor of shield, helmet, and spear stands before a woman who holds out her hands toward him. Theemblemon this young man's shield may reinforce an implicit connection with death. In Greek thought, snakes had strong connections with death and the afterlife.Scenes of men arming and departing for battle appeared frequently on Athenian vases of the mid-400s B.C. When they appear on white-ground lekythoi, a type of oil vessel used exclusively for funerary purposes, the meaning of the scenes is clear. The implication was that the man donning his armor and leaving his wife for war would never return. When the scenes appear onred-figurelekythoi, such as this one, which were not confined only to the funerary realm, the meaning is open to question. Did the Greek viewer see a simple everyday scene, or was there an ominous message of a doomed soldier 
Thisred-figurelekythos captures an intimate moment of a woman at her toilette. The nude woman glances back over her shoulder, momentarily turning her gaze from contemplating herself in the mirror. The unknown vase-painter included familiar household items, such as the small chest at the left and thekalathos, or wool basket, at the right. Scenes of a woman at her toilette are found in Athenian vase-painting from the early 500s B.C. on, but the women are usually clothed. The portrayal of this woman as nude may indicate that she is a hetaira, or prostitute. The use of added white paint for the woman's flesh--an unusual choice in red-figure pottery of the mid-400s B.C.--further emphasizes her nudity. This vase did not fire properly in the kiln. Much of its surface is a red-brown, rather than the standard deep black of Athenian pottery. The side of the lekythos to the right of the woman even has a  ghost  of ameanderpattern band caused by touching another vase during firing.
A nude youth holding a crop rides his horse on the front of this Chalkidianblack-figureneck-amphora. The back of the vase depicts a man and a woman who appear to be conversing. Chalkidian pottery was made by a workshop of immigrant Greek vase-painters who settled in Italy. Scholars call the style Chalkidian because some vases bear inscriptions written in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece. Through two generations of production in Italy, Chalkidian pottery remained thoroughly Greek in conception. For example, the depiction of a rider on this vase derived from the long-standing Greek use of the horse as a symbol of status and wealth. A painter's miscalculation on this vase sheds light on his creative process. On the front of the vase, the Phineus Painter first drew a set of lines marking out the panel for decoration. Then, he proceeded to paint the horse but found that the panel was too small and the horse's tail hung out over the edge. The last stage of vase decoration was to cover thebackgroundareas with black glaze. When the Phineus Painter reached this point, he had to accommodate the tail by creating a slanting area behind the horse rather than following his vertical guidelines.
Eyes, ears and a nose forming a face decorate each side of this Greek cup. The cup itself has a distinctive form with a deep bowl, a large foot with a tall, concave profile, and a thick ring joining the foot and the bowl. Scholars refer to cups with this combination of form and decoration as Chalkidian cups. The strikingly angular form of the foot has led some scholars to believe that the shape of the cup may have been derived from metal prototypes. Eyes decorate the exterior of all Chalkidian cups. In Greek thought, large, staring eyes had an apotropaic power, that is, they had the ability to ward off evil and danger. The painted eyes on this cup may have protected the drinker, or the frontal face may have represented an abbreviated mask connected withDionysos, the god of wine.Scholars do not know precisely where Chalkidian pottery was made. Inscriptions on some vases have letters in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece, but no vases have been found there, or anywhere outside Italy and the western Mediterranean. The vases were probably made in a Chalkidian colony in southern Italy or in an immigrant workshop inEtruria.
As these two figures gaze longingly at each other and the couple falls in love, the fate of a generation of Greek andTrojanwarriors is sealed. On this Athenianred-figurelekythos, the artist depicted the moment when Paris, the Trojan prince, meetsHelen, the wife of hishostMenelaos, the king ofSparta. Helen will run off with Paris, sparking theTrojan War. Paris and Helen meet in the palace at Sparta, whose lavish setting is indicated by the elaborate doors with raisedreliefknockers. Helen's companions frame the scene; one seems rather amazed to see a tiny version ofAphrodite, the goddess of love, blessing the union as she flies through the air in a chariot drawn byerotes. A lekythos was a container used for precious perfumed oils. Because it had a narrow neck, the oil poured out slowly and the cup-like mouth served as a funnel for filling the vessel.
The heroHerakleswrestles theNemean Lionon both sides of this Athenian,black-figureLittle Master cup. The Nemean Lion was a monstrous beast sent by the goddessHerato ravage the countryside around Nemea in southern Greece. Since the beast had an impenetrable hide, Herakles had to strangle him in the first of his twelve labors. The repetition of the same or very similar scenes on both sides of a vase was common in the 500s B.C.Little Master cups, introduced around 560 B.C. and so-named for their detailed miniature decoration, had a taller, slimmer shape than earlier cups. Little Master cups were either lip cups or band cups, easily differentiated by the placement of their decoration. A standard lip cup was decorated with a compact scene of one to three figures centered on each side of the lip with an inscription below, in the zone between the handles. The inscription might be a motto, an artist's signature, or, as in this case, just a nonsensical combination of letters, attesting to the decorative aspects of writing in this period, when few people were literate.
A chubby-faced young boy stares out at us, as he holds up a small pear in his left hand. The youth is probably the artist's son Giacomo Piazzetta, drawn when he was about ten or eleven years old. He wears a dark cap decorated with a feather on his head, while an elaborately patterned vest covers a white shirt with wide, billowing sleeves and a lacy collar.This captivating drawing shows Giovanni Battista Piazzetta's skill at capturing both his son's character and the different fabrics he wears. Softly smudged lines of dark hatching suggest the boy's rounded, fleshy cheeks, while touches of white chalk give shinyhighlightsto his nose, eyes, and chin. Piazzetta also managed to indicate the shimmering, silky texture of the boy's sleeve in contrast to the dark and velvety texture of his hat.
This is one of four identical, elaborately carved tables Charles VII had made for theKaisersaal(king's room) in the monastery of Kloster Ettal, near Munich. All four of the tables survive in museums, one in Germany and three in the United States. The Getty Museum's table displays a portrait, possibly of Charles, in the central medallion and a shield with the Austrian coat of arms on the stretcher below.Although this table was created in the 1740s when the exuberant Rococo style was fashionable, it exhibits only one Rococo feature: the asymmetrical grouping on the stretcher. The corner masks with their feather headdresses, tasseled lambrequins, curving shields, lion's paw feet, square section stretcher, and deep symmetrical frieze are all typical of the precedingRgenceperiod. Underneath the tabletop, in the center of the stretcher, two putti play with unlikely toys, a trophy of military arms and armor.
Painted to commemorate her marriage, this portrait of an unknown young woman is thependantto Nicolaes Pickenoy'sPortrait of a Man.An inscription dates the painting to 1632 and gives her age as twenty-one. As was common in such pairs of paintings, the young woman's three-quarter pose matches her husband's: each turns slightly toward the other while facing the viewer.Pickenoy was particularly adept at meticulously rendering details of his sitter's costumes, seen here in this carefully accurate portrait of a middle-classpatron. The sitter is distinguished by her costume of rich black satin with a gold-embroidered bodice. Delicate white lace forms her elegant cuffs and headdress. An enormous, pleated collar surrounds her neck. She wears gold jewelry around her waist, neck, and wrists; a ring adorns her right hand. In her left hand she holds a pair of gray silk gloves embroidered in multi-colored silk threads.
An inscription on this unidentified portrait indicates that the painting was made in 1632, when the sitter was twenty-seven years old. It was originally made as apendanttoPortrait of a Young Woman,acquired by J. Paul Getty in 1938. Although the sitters' identities are not known, the paintings were almost certainly created to celebrate a marriage. The pair are now reunited for the first time since they were separated in 1927.In the three-quarter length view favored for men of his day, a young, bearded man faces diagonally to thepicture planewith his left arm crooked and his hat in his right hand. His pose closely mirrors that of his wife, except that the husband's gaze and stance are more assertive while the wife's are more demure. He wears a rich black embroidered doublet with a black cloak folded around his waist and held in position by the gloved hand on his left hip. Precisely rendered white lace cuffs and collar enliven the restrained black costume.
Many new styles of writing desks appeared in the 1700s. Desks such as this delicate model were not designed for serious work; rather, these precious objects ornamented the room while providing their owners with a place to lock up their private letters. The front of this piece opens to reveal a velvet-lined writing surface and several drawers surrounding a pigeonhole.Parisianmarchands-mercierswere the first to use Svresporcelainplaques to decorate furniture. Creating a writing desk like this one was a complicated process involving many stages. First the dealer commissioned a design and ordered plaques from the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. He then selected anbnisteto make andveneerthe carcass of the desk, leaving space for the plaques. A variety of craftsmen designed and made thegiltbronzemounts. Another specialized worker lined the drawers with silk or velvet. Finally, thebnisteassembled the desk and returned it to the dealer to be sold.The two frieze and two spandrel plaques were painted by Claude Couturier. The central frieze plaque was gilded by Pierre-Andr Le Guay.
The Prince Imperial, son ofNapoleon III, sits strapped securely into a seat on his horse's back, a model subject for the camera. An attendant at the left steadies the horse so that the little prince remains picture-perfect in the center of the backdrop erected for the photograph. The horse stands upon a rug that serves as a formalizing element, making the scene appear more regal. The Emperor Napoleon III himself stands off to the right in perfect profile, supervising the scene with his dog and forming a framing mirror-image of the horse and attendant on the other side.Pierre-Louis Pierson placed his camera far enough back from the Prince to capture the entire scene and all the players, but this was not the version sold as a popularcarte-de-visite.Thecarte-de-visiteimage was cropped so that only the Prince upon his horse was visible.
Capitalizing on the popularity of calling cards in the mid-1800s, the French photographer A.A.E. Disdri seized upon the idea of pasting photographs to small cards. Cheap to produce, the carte-de-visite instantly became a popular form of portraiture during the 1850s and 60s. Images of celebrities and performers were in high demand and it was not unusual for a collector to assemble a group of such cards in one large album. Among the various dancers shown here is the noted ballerina Marie Petipa.
Pietro da Cortona made this drawing as a finished study for an engraving inDe florum cultura, the first treatise on horticulture. Pen in hand,Jupiterhas signed the edict to exhort all gardeners to cultivate flowers, marking the passing of the Age of Iron to the Age of Flowers. On the right, Cybele, the Phrygian earth mother, enters with her sacred animal, the lion. The council of gods has agreed that she and Flora, Roman goddess of flowers, shall grow flowers on earth.Pietro da Cortona drew here with the precision and minute detail of a miniaturist, a marked contrast to his usually more rugged and spontaneous approach. He applied brownwasheswith the point of the brush, used the pen for hatching and cross-hatching, and finally added delicate white highlights. Surface abrasions occurred when the engraver drew a sharp stylus over the outlines to impress the design into the metal printing plate. To replace earlier attempts, he drew Hercules' torso and one of the wingedNikefigures on smaller, cut-out pieces of paper overlaying the original sheet.
A monumental Saint Cecilia instructs assistants to distribute alms to a crowd. Although Cecilia is the darkest and most worked figure, she does not dominate; she is balanced by the tumultuous crowd.Pietro da Cortona's figures displayclassicalseriousness of action and sculptural weightiness. In his energetic style, the forceful line and vehementpentimentiin the figure of Saint Cecilia almost cause the line to burn through the paper. The drawing epitomizes the exuberant High Baroque style that Cortona helped to found as an architect and painter in Rome, combining operatic bravura with classical forms andmotifs. He synthesized Rome's architectural history for the setting, borrowing from the Pantheon andSaint Peter's basilica.
This highly finished study depicts the crucifixion of Christ. Mourning him are the Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdalene. Strong diagonals, animated gestures, fluttering drapery, and gray-brownwashwith whiteheighteningvividly express the dramatic moment. The opaqueness of the whitebodycolorallowed Pietro da Cortona to conceal some of his earlier attempts at drawing the figures, especially that of Saint John, who is bordered by an area of white that covers earlier positions for the right and left arms, the head, and left leg.The drawing was a preparatory study for a painting Pietro da Cortona made for the high altar of the church of San Tommaso di Villanova in Castelgandolfo outside Rome. The oval painting was commissioned by Pope Alexander VII and corresponds closely to this finished study. The grid lines indicate that the drawing wassquared, a method of preparing a composition for transfer to a larger surface.
These marble portraitbustswere not intended as apendantpair, but when displayed together they reveal a family resemblance--these are sisters. The elder, Brigitte Garnier d'Isle, alert and dignified, turns to her left with a far-off gaze. The younger Adlade very much resembles her elder sister, but her gaze is more immediate, her face more exuberant and her pursed lips seem to barely suppress a grin. Each sister displays a fashionable hairstyle, composed of tight waves of hair, and wears a loose shawl. Adlade's slightly more revealing drapery is knotted at her breast, reflecting her relative informality.Brigitte and Adlade were the daughters of the architect Jean-Charles Garnier d'Isle, who shared a personal and professional relation with the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. Garnier d'Isle designed the chteau and gardens of the lavish Bellevue estate ofMadame de Pompadour, the mistress ofLouis XV. Probably on the recommendation of Garnier d'Isle, Pigalle was commissioned to create garden statues at Bellevue. Garnier d'Isle clearly admired Pigalle's intimate and unembellished portrait style. He himself sat for a portrait that Pigalle exhibited, as a plaster bust, at theSalonof 1750.
As centers of commercial and cultural exchange, seaports bring together people from distant and diverse places. Here, colorful figures dance amid an exotic port's marketplace, which is lined by tropical-looking trees and European-style homes. This scene does not depict a real location, but rather, a figment of the artist's imagination. It also reflects European fascination with the Orient in the 1700s.In the painting's center, a man who appears to be Chinese dances and plays the bells, flanked by other, dark-skinned performers. Their figures cast long shadows across a flagstone plaza, mimicking the shapes of the garlands and swags draped on nearby trees and buildings. Veiled and turbaned vendors converse among the market stalls. At the back of the square, a Turkish sultana holds court in a tent topped with a crescent moon.The busy port in the distance stretches toward the horizon, creating a sense of deep space. The painting's symmetrical composition implies the setting for a performance. Recent scholarship suggests that Jean-Baptiste Pillement may have made this painting to commemorate a ballet commissioned and performed in Vienna in 1764.
Saint Catherine of Siena, a Christian mystic and lay member of theDominican Order, appears in half-length in the lower right corner, gazing upward at theCrucifixiontaking place high in the mountains. She holds a lily and aminiaturecrucifix identical to the one above. Hands folded in prayer, the wounds of herstigmataare visible on her palms. The viewer's eyes follow Saint Catherine's gaze, turned to the Virgin who looks up atChrist.Saint John the Evangelist, in a bright red and green garment, looks out sorrowfully and gestures towards the observer. Like the visionary Saint Catherine, the viewer is invited to contemplate the universal significance of Christ's suffering.Behind the figures, an extensive Italian landscape, elaborated with a winding river and a town, stretches into thebackground. To contrast with the somewhat static quality of the figures, Marco Pino has painted a tempestuous sky, dark blue near the top and gradually lightening into pink and yellow at the horizon, representing the darkness that came over the land for three hours whenJesusdied.
When he was twenty-three, Piranesi made this preparatory study for an etching. The etching was published as part of a series of architectural andperspectiveimages. He combined arches, pedestals, columns, bridges, and sculptures in an imaginative reconstruction of monumental and complexclassicalarchitecture. Piranesi took a creative approach when he made architectural fantasies like this one, usingantiqueruins as his point of departure. On this process he wrote:These speaking ruins have filled my spirit with images that accurate drawings, even such as those of the immortal Palladio, could never have succeeded in conveying, though I always kept them before my eyes.Piranesi first drew the main outlines of the architecture in chalk, then added brown and redwashfor shading and details. Small figures in boats are indicated with broad strokes of wash. Varying tones of wash and rapid, squiggly lines evoke atmospheric conditions. Asquaringin black chalk lines helped the artist transfer his design to the etching plate.
Spiraling across the page, four figures twist and bend in Giovanni Battista Piranesi's animated study of the male figure. Reaching out and touching one another, the figures connect and draw the viewer's eye upwards. Unlike an academic study of the static male figure, however, this is a study of movement. The drawing illustrates how Piranesi worked out ideas about form and posture. In some ways, the lively figures are unrealistic. For example, Piranesi put little effort into describing their hands and feet, which seem to end abruptly or break off altogether. The jagged parallel shading in the body adds energy but indicates his lack of concern for muscular detail. The drawing may have formed part of a stock selection in Piranesi's workshop, from which he could later borrow images. He was known to enliven many of his compositions with human figures, although these particular figures have not been specifically identified with that purpose.
In this closely trimmed historiated initialSfrom a gradual, the illuminator represented Saul's dramatic conversion to Christianity. Dressed in a soldier's helmet and armor, Saul tumbles to earth, his horse collapsing beneath him. Though the artist omitted the rest of the biblical account, in which Saul changes his name to Paul and takes up an evangelical Christian mission, the initial's viewers would have been familiar with the story. In the top half of the initial, another soldier, seated erect on a more elaborately liveried steed, wears a fancy hat and tunic trimmed in green, white, and red, the colors of both the Gonzaga and Este families. Given his visual precedence in the image, this man may have been the book's patron, commissioning the gradual for use in his family's private chapel or for an ecclesiastical foundation under his protection.Interplay between the naturalistic and decorative elements in the initial adds visual tension to the miniature. The artist represented the imposing physical presence of the horses, including details such as the horseshoes and armor and subtly modeling the surfaces, such as the animals' coats. He then harmoniously integrated these carefully observed figures and their details within the artificial constraints of the shape of the letterS.
Within a few hundred yards of his home, Camille Pissarro painted a view of peasants working in a shady, wooded garden alongside a group of village houses. In the foreground, a woman carrying a bucket pauses to talk with a young boy carrying his school satchel over his shoulder. The gray sky and the trees losing their leaves indicate autumn.Painting in the open air alongside Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pissarro followed a new practice of breaking up surfaces with loosely placed brushstrokes. This revolutionary technique, the cornerstone of Impressionism, helps to reveal how light and movement affect the perception of objects. Pissarro made the canvas a field of textures and movement; the character of the brushstroke varies according to the texture and form of the object it describes. For example, the haystack is painted with straw-shaped brushstrokes, the leaves are suggested by jagged daubs of paint, and the stucco walls are depicted with broad, smooth strokes.
As much as a specific location, this large watercolor represents a particular season. The palette of muted browns, blacks, greens, and blues create an autumnal landscape. The pale blue-gray sky, streaked with clouds, and the sparse foliage, both on and fallen from the almost bare trees, also convey winter's approach. A single figure and, in the distance, a figure and carriage, move along the desolate road curving through the scene.Camille Pissarro's landscape shows the road to the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye from Louveciennes, a village west of Paris. Many of Pissarro's landscapes of the early 1870s show the roads into and out of Louveciennes. Pissarro himself lived intermittently in Louveciennes and was part of a close-knit community of landscape painters who lived or traveled there including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.During the early 1870s, Pissarro began experimenting with the emerging Impressionist painting style by returning to watercolor, a medium he had used as a student during the 1850s. Using black chalk, Pissarro first indicated the main features of the composition. He then fleshed out the scene by covering almost the entire sheet with watercolor. Pissarro experimented with some of the spontaneous effects of watercolor, allowing it to pool and tide in some areas and applying it more evenly in others to create a diffuse light. He used broad, wet strokes to define the sky and smaller strokes, with more pigment on the brush, to articulate the foliage and figures.Also in the Getty's collection, the paintingHouses at Bougival (Autumn)was made by Pissarro about one year before this drawing. Although they depict similar subjects, the two works explore different effects. Here, the artist focuses on the fleeting atmospheric effects of light and air; in the painting, Pissarro places more emphasis on the geometric properties of the houses in the landscape.
These finelychasedwall lights represent the bounty of the harvest season. The central shaft symbolizes the thyrsus, or rod, ofBacchus, the Greek god of wine, a traditional symbol of abundance. The branches of the light formcornucopiasoverflowing with fruit, flowers, and leaves. Claude-Jean Pitoin made this set of four wall lights toilluminatethe small private room that Marie-Antoinette used as a retreat at the palace ofVersailles. As with all the objects made for the French queen, the set of small wall lights are of the highest quality. The chasing and thegildingof this light is jewel-like in its remarkable finish, proof of the care that went into its production.
According to Greek legend, Achilles fell in love with theTrojanprincess Polyxena, the daughter of the king of Troy. He was offered her hand in marriage if he agreed to end the war between the Greeks and the Trojans. At Polyxena's request, Achilles came to make a sacrifice toApollo, but he was ambushed byParis, Polyxena's brother, as he knelt at the altar. Paris shot a fatal arrow into Achilles' heel, his one vulnerable spot. Before he died, Achilles vengefully proclaimed that the treacherous Polyxena be sacrificed at his tomb.Here Giovanni Battista Pittoni depicted the ghost of Achilles demanding that his bride be killed. Polyxena, wearing a white wedding gown, extends her arm toward the priest brandishing a knife and with great dignity steps forward toward the tomb. Around her, a throng of Greeks and Trojans watch with mixed emotions. Although a violent subject, Pittoni's elegant, richly garbed figures and elaborateantiquearchitecture make an appealing picture of mythological martyrdom.
When a local governor commissioned a stained-glass window for his church, he chose Hans Jacob Plepp to create a design for it. Plepp drew this drawing to communicate his ideas to the glass painter, who would produce the final version. As so many areas have been left empty, this drawing seems to be apreliminary study. The wordsFides(faith) andSpes(hope), inscribed in black spaces in the lower left and right corners, suggest that Plepp intended to placepersonificationsof these virtues in these areas. On the more finished left side of the drawing, the horse and scrolling leafy branches burst with vitality, though seen in sculptural rather than fleshy terms. The supple line work and the bold application ofwashindicating shadows carry through the impression of stone rather than living tissue. On the right, in contrast, Plepp merely outlined the symmetrical elements and summarily filled them in. The small notations in thecoat of armssuggest colors for the glass artist.
The well-dressed man in cravat and top hat appears to be reading thePhiladelphia Ledgernewspaper that he holds in his hands, but his fixed gaze falls somewhere above the paper, at a point outside of the frame. A sliver of windowsill visible at the left indicates that the source of light was a window, which admitted sunlight to illuminate the scene and cast a harsh light against the side of the man's stern face. Scholars have suggested that the sitter is a publisher and that therefore this is a kind of occupational portrait, but no pictorial evidence within the frame positively links him to a particular occupation.
 Mr. Plumbe's National Daguerrian Gallery at Concert Hall...an establishment whose superior merits are well deserving the notice of all who feel an interest in the beautiful art of Photography...is now engaged in taking views of all the public buildings,  read theUnited States Journalnewspaper in January 1846. By February, another Washington, D.C. paper noted that  Views of the Capitol...embellish the walls [of John Plumbe's gallery] and are the subject of universal commendation. Plumbe's three views of the United States Capitol form its first photographic record. Here it is shown in an oblique view of the east front, with the White House visible in the far distance at the right. The Capitol, whose original building was begun in 1791 and took thirty-four years to construct, stands at the intersection of Pennsylvania, Constitution, and Independence Avenues. When Plumbe photographed it in the 1840s, before extensive expansions had begun, it was a relatively simple building but one that had already been altered by at least four architects. The early wings that then housed the House of Representatives and the Senate presently serve to connect the chambers with the central rotunda.
Bernardino Poccetti made a number of individual figure drawings in chalk as studies for painted compositions. This figure was probably intended as a study for a wallfresco. Given the position of the legs and the angle of the man's face and arm, the final work in which he appeared was probably meant to be seen from below.Poccetti used the white of the paper to create the reflection of light off the man's costume and skin. The delicate contour and line-his chalk barely touched the paper-give the figure an appearance of refinement. Broad modeling, appearing in some areas as quick scribbles across the sheet, flattens the picture and creates a linear pattern across the sheet. Rather than setting the figure of the man off, Poccetti connected it to the background with shading almost entirely surrounding it.
While two angels flutter overhead, ready to guide their souls into heaven, the bodies of the blessed monks Ugoccione and Sostegno lie in state surrounded by other brethren of the Servite Order. To give the scene a sense of greater depth, Bernardino Poccetti used a rather broad and deep spatial arrangement. The arched ceiling draws the viewer's eye into the setting, while contrasting patches of dark shadow and light keep it moving. A monastery commissioned Poccetti to produce a series of fourteen frescoes with scenes from the lives of the monastery's founders, and he made this elaborate study for one of them.On the verso of the sheet, another artist, possibly Giovanni Navarretti, sketched a study of the Farnese Hercules.
After choosing this unusual side angle on the arch of Septimius Severus, Cornelis van Poelenburgh concentrated on the contrasting patterns of sunlight and shade on the structure. He juxtaposed broadly washed areas of deep shadow with brilliantlyilluminatedpassages articulated by the white paper. His interesting choice of an oblique view of the arch, highlighting the narrow columns, and his omission of several architectural features allowed Poelenburgh to treat it as blocks of light and shadow rather than as a specific structure. Clusters of vegetation growing through cracks in the stonework, formed with simple, looped strokes, appear as the only distraction.
A sense of uninhibited freedom pervades the scene as a group of women bathe, lounge, and socialize in an area below a rocky hillside. Drying herself, the woman in the center of the painting turns toward her voluptuous nude companion lying in theforeground. Cornelius van Poelenburgh softly modeled the figures, evoking the texture of tender flesh. The landscape captures the atmospheric qualities of the Italian countryside and deliberately calls to mind an idyllic mythological land filled with languidnymphs.Van Poelenburgh was best known for cabinet-size paintings, small easel paintings intended to be viewed at close range. Like this one, many were painted on copper and represented ruins, shepherds, peasants, travelers, and an occasional mythological or religious scene.
A group of visitors is frozen in time at the steps of the Pantheon, a famousNeoclassicalbuilding in Paris. Barely visible horses, carriages, and sightseers give an awe-inspiring sense of scale to the scene. Louis-Alphonse Poitevin observed the enormous edifice--72 feet high and 276 feet wide--from the roof of one of the buildings that faced it. Begun in 1757 as the Church of Sainte-Genevive, the Pantheon is now a civic building housing the remains of some of France's most famous citizens.
The river Seine is a polished mirror: not a ripple or wave disturbs the glassy surface of the water. Though they are the only contemporary clues in an otherwise timeless setting, the boats moored at the center do not seem like vessels of travel at all as they jut out from the banks like low-lying docks. Everything is quiet in this scene. Although the sun dances in shadows across the path, gently kissing with light the building simply labeledDupre,not a single passer-by strolls along. Seemingly no one is awake except the photographer, quietly recording the landscape and town at rest.
Polidoro da Caravaggio made this careful study of a naked man with his left leg extended and his arms raised above his drooping head. Another sketch of his pointed left foot and calf appears along the top of the sheet, while his disembodied left arm floats along the right side of the sheet.Polidoro applied the red chalk energetically, describing the taut muscles of the man's chest, arms, and thighs with strong diagonal shading. His head, in contrast, is loosely drawn, as the artist preferred to concentrate on the position and form of the body instead. The sharply pointed toes on the single foot provide a sharp contrast to the limp angle of his hand.Scholars believe Polidoro produced this sketch in connection with a martyrdom scene.When the Getty Museum purchased this sheet, its parts were arranged differently, with the arm at the right margin incorrectly attached along the lower edge. Museum conservators restored the fragment to its proper position.
Among Sigmar Polke's earliest images, this photograph was made in 1968, the year that Polke graduated from art school and published his first portfolio of photographs. Documentary in style, it portrays ordinary, deliberately mundane objects in Polke's studio.This arrangement of five mounted coat hooks with bent matches dangling from wires is a sculptural construction that Polke created for the purpose of photographing it. As demonstrated by the choice of uneven lighting and haphazard framing, the photograph reflects Polke's abiding interest in depicting visual information in ways that challenge conventional notions of artistic merit or beauty.
When seen without illumination in the megalethoscope viewer, this scene across the Tiber River in Rome shows two fishermen in daylight in theforegroundwith the Colosseum and the dome of St. Peter's visible in the distance. However, when illuminated, the scene transforms from day into twilight and eventually night by means of wooden flaps on the projector that can be opened and closed to control the light levels. Pinprick perforations in the print achieve the shimmeringhighlightson the water's surface. The overall coloring is a result of a hand-painted scrim glued to the back of thealbumen print, which when lit gives off a tinted glow.
When Peter Paul Rubens decided to have an engraving made after his 1618altarpieceof theAssumption of the Virgin,a young member of his studio, Paulus Pontius, made a detailed drawing of the painting in black chalk. Scholars believe that little evidence of Pontius's design remains. Rubens extensively reworked the drawing, probably in an effort to instruct Pontius on how to make good engravings after his paintings, an activity that Rubens considered very important. The young Pontius went on to become one of the most successful interpreters of Rubens's work through engravings.
The figure of Saint Francis kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, wearing a hooded cassock. Soft lines of parallel hatching as well as smudging give texture and depth to the image, which contains few details. Pontormo used this sketch in preparation for painting the saint in analtarpiece. He drew Saint Francis over a partially obliterated standing man with a staff in his left hand, posed frontally with his head tilted to the left.Pontormo also conserved paper on theverso, drawing a powerful image of the dead Christ with his head thrown dramatically backward, over a female figure in profile. With a flurry of pencil strokes, he suggested an emaciated body with slender limbs and taut flesh. The right margin of the drawing also contains fragmentary sketches, perhaps of drapery, indicating that the sheet used to be larger and had further drawings on it.
Sharp, angular, energetic lines, seen most clearly on the verso figure, frequently characterized Pontormo's drawing style. While these are merely studies, exploring ideas for parts of a painting, they clearly suggest the emotional intensity of his art and the sharp contrast with the preceding ideal of classical High Renaissance harmony.Pontormo made these drawings as preliminary figure studies for an altarpiece commissioned for a church in Florence in 1518, a work that some scholars consider the first clear manifestation of Mannerism in Italian painting. The full-length figure on the recto served as a source for the putto at the painting's top right.The kneeling figure on the verso was a study for the young John the Baptist, who appears in the same general pose at the painting's center and also looks upward. In working out the exact pose for this figure, Pontormo first drew the right leg sharply bent in red chalk, then sketched it in fully extended. In the final painting, he settled on an angle between the two.
Pontormo sketched both therectoandversofigures from a nude male model, probably in his studio. He probably made the studies in preparation for afrescohe painted at aMedicivilla outside Florence from 1520 to 1521. After conceiving of the composition of the fresco as a whole, he tried out individual figures. He may have used and reused aspects of the pose of this body for several of the fresco's figures.Biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Pontormo almost obsessively revised his ideas for this fresco; his many known drawings for the project attest to the search for perfection. In the foot and calf of this figure in particular, Pontormo approached the paper repeatedly, imparting almost nervous energy as he refined the lines. On the verso, the smooth outlines of the reclining figure skillfully match the relaxation and refinement of the pose itself. Pontormo ultimately transformed this figure's pose into that of a female attendant in the fresco.
Using soft, broad strokes of black chalk, Pontormo built up the figure of a young man lying on his right side, propping himself up on his elbow. Ambiguous facial features indicate that Pontormo was more interested in the figure's posture than in a true likeness of an individual. Pontormo made this drawing as a preparatory study for a scene of the martyrdom of Saint Lawrencefor theCertosa del Galluzzo, a monastery outside Florence. However, it was Pontormo's pupil Bronzino who executed the finished fresco.Saint Lawrence is usually depicted as a young man. According to legend, Lawrence was a third-century Roman deacon who was responsible for distributing goods to the poor. When a greedy high-ranking official demanded that Lawrence give him the church's treasure, Lawrence presented a group of poor people, saying that they were the church's treasure. For this defiant act, he was arrested and tortured on a burning gridiron.  In the finished work, Bronzino made only small changes to Pontormo's composition.  Bronzino's figure lies on a gridiron and turns his head to the left, as he is crowned by a cherub. He holds a palm leaf in his left hand, an emblem of martyrdom. Pontormo's drawing probably provided Bronzino with a model for human musculature and proportions that artists strived to achieve in the 1500s.
Standing before a fortress wall, this well-dressed foot soldier holds a combination spear and battle-ax called a halberd. His direct stare and swaggering pose are strikingly poignant, given the smooth unlined face and slim body that betray him as no more than a teenager. As a portraitist, Jacopo Pontormo was renowned for his subtle, complex psychological studies; here he conveyed the naive arrogance and vulnerability of youth. Court painter to Duke Cosimo de' Medici, Pontormo pioneered the Mannerist style in Florence, initiating a new, sophisticated type of portraiture in which elegance and aristocratic reserve play key roles. The sitter's identity has been much discussed. The Florentine painter Giorgio Vasari noted that during the siege of Florence in about 1528 Pontormo painted a  most beautiful work,  a portrait of young nobleman Francesco Guardi as a soldier. Francesco's birthdate of 1514 would make him about the age of Pontormo's teenage sitter. Based on a Florentine inventory, Cosimo de' Medici himself has also been suggested as the painting's subject.
Saint PeterMartyr, a Dominican friar, was murdered by hired assassins. This drawing shows the murderer forcefully restraining the struggling priest, who tries to ward off his attacker with an upraised arm.  Pordenone conveyed a sense of immediacy by using a loose, gestural line and broad, quick cross-hatching.  The pathos shown on the face of Saint Peter Martyr and the brute strength indicated by the muscular right arm and fist of the assassin indicate the artist's skill in capturing this violent act. Pordenone probably made this study for a competition with Titian and Palma Vecchio to paint analtarpiecefor a church in Venice.
Music formed a recurring theme in the work of Jacques-Andr Portail. In this drawing, two young women lean together over a book of music to sing a song, accompanied by a flutist. A single man stands behind the trio, leaning forward with his hands stuck in his vest and pocket to observe the music.Though he skillfully represented the figures' elegant costumes, Portail focused more on the scene's quiet absorption, as all four appear to be totally engrossed in their activity. He built up the scene with numerous, dense lines of different intensities and simply left the highlighted areas blank, allowing the whiteness of the paper to form thetonalcontrast.
I had heard Glen Canyon described, by those who planned to reserve that part of the river for hydroelectric power development, as an unspectacular, gently flowing stretch of the river unruffled by significant rapids, that in fact the Bureau of Reclamation had begun to dam. From the very first day, I was overwhelmed by the scenery--both in prospect and in description grossly underrated. The monumental structure of the towering walls in variety and color defied comprehension.--Eliot PorterEliot Porter made his first rafting trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon in 1960. He became captivated by the region's beauty, and over the next decade, returned to it ten times to photograph its weathered trees, colorful rock formations, and hidden slit canyons. This image of a sheer sandstone wall in vivid shades of salmon and purple demonstrates Porter's keen observation of the region's unique beauty.In the early 1960s, the Sierra Club was in the middle of a campaign to stop construction of a hydroelectric plant on the Colorado River at Glen Canyon. Its director thought a book of Porter's photographs might be persuasive. Porter had already collaborated with the environmental organization on a publication that earned critical praise. In 1963, the Sierra Club and Porter published the bookThe Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.Copies were sent to President John F. Kennedy and members of Congress. That same year, construction of the Glen Canyon Dam was completed, creating Lake Powell and flooding hundreds of miles of the river and its tributary canyons. Porter's Glen Canyon photographs became especially meaningful in the aftermath of the dam's construction, as a record of a lost national treasure. Glen Canyon lacked national park status and protection because it was  the place no one knew.  Although Porter's efforts did not stop construction of the dam, they did spur federal review of reclamation projects on western rivers and passage of the Wilderness Act.
Porter's portrait of a tree with brilliant red fall foliage is meant to inspire preservation of the land for its beauty. Between the late 1930s, when the first popular color film was invented, and the mid-1970s, Porter dedicated himself to photographing nature. Remarkable for its subtle luminosity, his work was published in concert with conservation efforts and contributed to widespread acceptance of color photographs as art.
The beauty of the Icelandic landscape is not limited to volcanic phenomena, the mountains of igneous rock, the torrential rivers and thunderous falls, or the ice-filled glacial lakes; its vegetation is also a major attraction. The trees are dwarfed and stunted. Tundra covers much of the interior; arctic and alpine wildflowers bloom in seemingly unlimited abundance in summer. But the most striking contribution to Iceland's plant life is its mosses.--Eliot PorterA consistent thread in Eliot Porter's photography is his scientific attention to detail; his ability to observe what often goes unnoticed. Iceland's luxurious mosses, which blanket the region instead of forests, first drew Porter to visit the island in 1972. This photograph displays their startling range of colors and textures. Rocks rounded and smoothed by river water are draped with splotches of rust, yellow, gold, and green.In 1972, the Sierra Club published Iceland, a portfolio of twelve dye transfer prints in an edition of 110. Porter also wanted to publish a book on the subject, but he could not find a publisher.  Undaunted, Porter persisted and seventeen years later, it was published. The book contains an essay by Porter's son Jonathan, who often traveled with him. In the foreword, Jonathan wrote:  Iceland possesses a primordial quality, as if one were a time traveler viewing an earlier formative age of the earth.  Porter's close-up views, like this one, convey that uniqueness.
Studies made by two Dutch artists during an exploratory expedition to Brazil from 1637 to 1644 were the inspiration for this tapestry. The newly appointed Dutch governor, Prince Johan Maurits of Nassau, led a group of scientists and artists, including Albert Eckhout and Frans Post, to Brazil, where they studied and painted the unusual plant and animal life of this country. Many of the plants, fish, birds, and other animals woven in this hanging can be traced to life studies made by Eckhout and Post in South America. French artists at the Gobelins manufactory, who designed thecartoonto heighten the tapestry's impression of drama and exoticism, probably introduced other animals, such as the Indian rhinoceros and  striped horse  or zebra.
Silhouetted against rolling, stormy, clouds, a gray, spotted horse stands, turning its head slightly to suggest its alertness to its surroundings. Paulus Potter, the finest Dutch animal painter of his day, described the horse with scrupulous attention to physical detail: the glossy sheen of its coat and mane, the watery moistness of its eye, and the sleekly elegant lines of the animal's body. At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free. His immaculate grooming and position before cultivated fields, however, imply that the source of Dutch prosperity lay in the control that humans were able to exert over brute nature.
Aputtoand an attendant may be leading a bride--the woman on the left--to her groom whileCupidurges her on, but the subject is not perfectly clear. The drawing might merely represent anyclassicalhuman marriage scene, or it might represent a more specific mythological theme such as the marriage ofBacchusand Ariadne.Nicolas Poussin used more ink andwashto make drawings than any other medium, combining graceful, fluid lines with a sensitive, judicious use of wash. Here he created beautifully rippling costumes that gently move along with the young women yet also have a modest life of their own. Characteristically, he chose to leave the women's features abstract.
The nine Muses, goddesses of poetic inspiration and the creative arts, surround the god Apollo, who plays alira di braccio. With Homer and Virgil, they gather along the Castalian spring, which flows through the center of the scene. Famous in ancient times as a source of inspiration and learning, this place was appropriate for making music and contemplating the beauty of Mount Parnassus.Nicolas Poussin created an animated scene full of movement, not only through the composition and arrangement of the figures but also through his drawing style. He based the composition for this drawing on an engraving by Marcantonio Raimoni after Raphael'sParnassusfresco in the Vatican, placing the figure of Apollo to the left of the center. The semi-circular arrangement of the other figures draws the viewer's eye around the scene and up through the trees to the putti in the air. The soft washes contrast with the fine pen lines, giving the drawing a lively sense of three dimensions.
 My temperament compels me to look for and take pleasure in well-ordered things. I avoid confusion, which is contrary and opposed to my nature, just as light is opposed to the darkness of night,  wrote Nicolas Poussin.Saint John baptizes the multitudes in an ideal landscape, framed by a tree trunk on each side. Clothed inantiquecostumes, the orderly followers have arranged themselves into a carefully balancedfrieze. As always, Poussin approached this religious work from the tradition of order, clarity, and harmony associated with the art of ancient Greece and Rome.Poussin painted this religious scene for one of his key patrons, Roman antiquarian and scientist Cassiano dal Pozzo. Also in the 1630s, Poussin painted a series of the Seven Sacraments for Cassiano, to which this canvas may be related.
My temperament compels me to look for and take pleasure in well-ordered things. I avoid confusion, which is contrary and opposed to my nature, just as light is opposed to the darkness.Thus Nicolas Poussin explained his tendency to balance and choreograph even the violence and haste inherent in his narrative subjects. In drawings such as this one, he worked out the structure of a composition using clear strokes that captured the figures' essential gestures or shapes. He then toned down the movement, gesture, and tumult in the final painting. This is a typical development for most painters, but one even more conspicuous in Poussin's work. He made this study and at least five others in preparation for a painting commissioned by a member of an illustrious Italian family prominent in government and civic affairs and active patrons of the arts.
Nicolas Poussin made this drawing as a study for the central group in a painting of the marriage of Neptune and Amphitrite, the god and goddess of the sea. It may show his initial steps in developing the final composition of the painting, commissioned by Cardinal Richelieu, an important art patron and chief minister for Louis XIII. Using simple oval forms for bodies and heads and lightly sketched limbs, Poussin worked out the spatial relationships among the figures. He changed the arrangement in the final painting but kept the two seated nymphs and the triton with a fluttering piece of drapery.
Nicolas Poussin is primarily known as a painter of history subjects, but he was also an accomplished landscapist. He probably made this drawing for its own sake, rather than as a study for a painting.Poussin probably made this view on the spot. He captured the atmosphere of a wooded path opening onto a grassy clearing, with sunlight streaming through a thicket of trees. With vivid touches of his pen and brush, he skillfully suggested the deep shadows on the trunks of the trees and the sunlight penetrating their foliage.
Nicolas Poussin may have made this drawing and one other to reconstruct an ancient cameo, or he might have copied a hanging ornament from ancient Rome. Roman mythology often representedBacchus, the god of wine, as a handsome young man and a powerful god, sometimes with a lionskin or an empty drinking vessel.In this very finished drawing, Poussin usedwashin light and dark tones over pen lines to model the figure and to set it off from the background, as if it were a cameo or a relief. He commonly copied ancient objects in his drawings, using these careful records to add authentic details to hisclassicizingpaintings.
Given his lifelong interest inclassicalantiquity, Nicholas Poussin repeatedly sketched the antique objects he saw in Rome. Except for theEtruscanmirror in the top right, which dates from the 200s A.D., each object on this sheet is Roman, from various ancient eras.The careful study of the hexagonal tripod base, with its spare lines and precise details, hints at Poussin's adherence to the ancient classical conventions of architecturalperspective. He executed the draped torso and the sandaled foot with a similarly spare technique and attention to structure. He might have sketched the mirror from life, as it may have been in a Roman nobleman's collection, and he probably sketched the tripod in the upper left corner after a drawing in another collector's  Paper Museum.  Finally, hen sketched the figure of the young boy after a late Roman bust now in an English country house, capturing his bulla, a protective amulet worn by Roman children, with just a few tight lines and light brushes ofwash.Theversopresents more disparate objects: twosphinxes, a woman carrying a vase, and an elaborate ornamental Roman ceilingfrieze.
Nicolas Poussin never tired of studying antiquities, and his recordings of them make up a large proportion of his body of drawings. For this sketch, he probably copied two ancient statues, noting each variation in the arrangement of their drapery. Emphasizing the pattern of folds, he traced the heavier cloth of the mantle worn over the lighter, crinkly fabric of the short tunic.Theversoshows a section of a Roman table support currently in a museum in Naples. During Poussin's lifetime, the table stood in aMedicifamily villa in Rome. The left side shows Scylla, a woman who became a female monster with wild dogs baying around her waist. From her rock on the Italian side of the Straits of Messina, she barked like a dog and threatened sailors. A centaur, half horse and half man, supported the right half of the table.
In the late 1640s and early 1650s, at the height of his artistic maturity, Nicolas Poussin turned from historical narrative to landscape painting.Landscape with a Calmdoes not illustrate a story but rather evokes a mood. The ordered composition and clear, golden light contribute toA Calm'sutter tranquility, while glowing, gem-like colors and fluid paint strokes enliven this scene of benevolent nature. Poussin's sketching campaigns in the Roman countryside with his friend and fellow landscape painter Claude Lorrain account, in part, for its fresh observation of cloud-scattered sky and grazing goats.Poussin painted a pendant to this painting,Landscape with a Storm,now in a museum in Rouen. Together their contrasting weather effects embody nature's changing and unpredictable relationship with man. Poussin painted these works for the Parisian merchant Jean Pointel, a friend a great collector of his landscape paintings.
Nicolas Poussin was highly revered in his own time for his religious and historical paintings, painted in a classical style based on antique and High Renaissance art. Made late in Poussin's life, this meticulously ordered composition reveals the artist's rational inclination.Poussin placed the Holy Family in an idealized landscape with sixteenth-century Italianate buildings. The Virgin Mary sits in the center, but the action focuses on the embrace shared by Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. To the left, Saint Elizabeth gazes steadily at Mary, perhaps foreseeing her future suffering. Saint Joseph leans against a wall and smiles approvingly at the scene below.Putti or infant boys pay homage to Christ by bringing gifts. One putto crosses his arms across his chest in adoration, and another putto kneels, spilling a basket of flowers on the ground before Christ. Others carry a ewer, a towel, and a basin of water, which may refer to the bathing of the child or to John's later baptism of Christ.In the middle distance a man ferries a woman across a lake, possibly alluding to the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt, a theme popularized by Poussin and others in the 1600s.
Venus, the goddess of love, is shown naked, undressing for her bath. She stands with her right hand modestly covering her pubic area while her left hand drops her garment on a vase. Her eyes were originally inlaid in a contrasting material, and she would have worn earrings.This Roman statuette copies on a smaller scale one of the most famous Greek statues ever made. About 350 B.C. the Greek sculptor Praxiteles carved a cult statue of the goddessAphrodite, the first full-scale female nude in Greek art. Praxiteles' statue became extremely popular, especially in theHellenisticand Roman periods, capturing the attention of both writers and artists. Although the original statue does not survive, its popularity led to a huge production of copies and variations on the theme, so that today more nude Aphrodites survive than any other single ancient statue type.The idea of the goddess caught in a private moment follows a certain voyeuristic tradition in Hellenistic art, and part of the statue's appeal was clearly erotic. The gesture of the goddess's right hand is ambiguous, drawing attention to her pubis and concealing it at the same time. Roman writers such asPlinydid not hesitate to point out the overtly sexual reaction that Praxiteles' statue produced in viewers.
Acanthus leaves, a mask, and rosettes, all typicalmotifsof the lateBaroqueperiod, decorate this pair of oval mirrors. The mirror glass reflected the flames of the candles held in the holders, thereby increasing the amount of light produced.Small mirrored wall lights, consisting of one branch each, would probably have hung in a bedroom or study of a private townhouse. The numbers20and22painted on the back of each mirror suggest that this pair was once part of a much larger set.The wall lights closely follow a design for mirrors by Daniel Marot, published in an engraving in Holland in 1703. They resemble other silvered andgildedwall lights in the Royal Palace of Drottningholm in Sweden.
In the 1720s the town of Breslau in present-day Poland became a center of activity for free-lance artists who decorated glass and ceramic wares in their own studios, independent of factory supervision. Ignaz Preissler, who painted the intricate scenes on this bowl, was one of the most accomplished of theseHausmaler(home painters). Using a plainporcelainbowl imported from China and decorated only with adiaper-patternedrim in underglaze blue, Preissler painted on anallegoricalscene in lead black. He copied engravings after a ceiling painting by Pierre Mignard depicting the four seasons in the chteau of Saint-Cloud. The bowl's interior scene, which shows the marriage ofFloraandZephyr, represents Spring, and the sacrifice ofCereson the outside represents Summer. The plate on which the bowl once stood, which illustrates Autumn and Winter, is now in the Muse Nationale de Ceramique in France.
The owner may have used this small dish to serve condiments at the dinner table or just displayed it as a decorative item. The branch-like handle and feet made from a flowering twig complement the bowl's inventive form: a cupped, heart-shaped leaf. Suchnaturalisticforms echo Chinese scholars' porcelain brush rests. The floral theme continues around the outside in the painted decoration as birds, spurting fountains, and winged figures intermingle with twisting leafy branches. A fanciful scene of a wingedcupidholding a bulrush and seated astride a sea monster decorates the interior.
A chubby angel sweeps down from the right, cheeks puffed out as he blows air forcefully into his outstretched trumpet. Mattia Preti used dark, exuberant strokes of red chalk to outline the arms, chest, eyebrows, and cheeks of the angel. He used light hatching to give texture and to create shadows, and quickly sketched the position of the wings.Preti created this work as a preparatory study for a fresco in the cupola of the church of San Biagio in Modena, Italy. In that church, a nearly identical angel hovers over a window on the rim of the cupola, directing his trumpet towards Saint Jerome. Knowing that Preti finished his work on the frescoes in the church by March 1652, scholars guess that this drawing was finished sometime before this. Despite thepentimentialong the angel's right arm and an added twist to the shape of the trumpet, this drawing is very similar to the fresco and must represent a final stage in the preparation of the composition.
In a plumed helmet, the Persian warrior-maiden Clorinda arrives on her white horse to save the lovers Sofronia and Olindo who are about to be burned at the stake. The subject comes from one of the most popular books of its time,Torquato Tasso'sepic about theFirst Crusade. When Aladine, the king of Jerusalem, threatened to execute the whole Christian community for the theft of a sacred image, Sofronia took the responsibility on herself to save the others. Her beloved Olindo then claimed to be the thief to save her, but Aladine condemned them both. Impressed by the young couple's courage, Clorinda saved them from the fire by offering to fight for the king in the coming battle with theCrusaders.All eyes are riveted on Clorinda, whose leaning posture and pointing gesture lead diagonally up to the figures of Sofronia and Olindo. Figures press close to the picture plane against a turbulent black, yellow, and orange streaked sky. Mattia Preti used strongchiaroscuroto contrast the partially illuminated, startled faces of the crowd with the determination of Clorinda's shadowed profile. Sofronia and Olindo are brightly lit, perhaps indicating the nearness of the fire.
A young woman turns her head to look over her left shoulder, staring out with dark, almond shaped eyes. She wears a high-necked dress with an embroidered collar that opens at her throat, revealing a narrow necklace or clasp. Aschuffa,or headdress made of braided hair held in place by a brooch in the center, decorates her head. Although her identity is unknown, the format of the portrait and her clothing indicate the sitter was from northern Italy. The artist sketched her in chalk in the early 1500s in preparation for a formal painting. Scholars are uncertain about the meaning of the chalk lines in the bottom left corner. They may signal an abandoned attempt at drawing one of the sitter's hands or the upper sleeve of her drapery.
The Svres porcelain manufactory produced numerous plates with a wide variety of decoration, either as matching sets or as part of dinner or dessert services. This example, however, is one of a small number of individually decorated plates intended for display rather than use. The gilding is more finely detailed and the floral reserves more delicately painted than normal. The reddish-brown ground flecked with gold was also experimental and was apparently not used for any other service.Svres may have sold sample plates like this one as collector's items or for presentation to favored clients.
Furniture made entirely of metal was extremely rare in the 1700s as each individual piece had to be laboriously forged. Very few pieces still exist today. This console table, executed in the massive earlyNeoclassicalstyle, was almost certainly made by Pierre Deumier, a metal worker and a locksmith. In a French newspaper he advertised a table whose description closely matches this console. A similar console table appears in a 1766 drawing by the French architect Victor Louis. The Polish king Stanislas Auguste II commissioned it for a room in the royal palace in Warsaw. That table was delivered in 1769, but its present location is unknown.
Candles, along with firelight, were the only sources of illumination after dark in the 1700s. Wall lights such as these were usually fixed on either side of a mirror so that the reflection multiplied the flames of the candles.These wall lights were modeled to represent flaming torches. The Getty Museum has a drawing of this design; it is thought to be by the same hand, Jean-Louis Prieur. Lights of the same design appear in a watercolor drawing of the grand salon in the Chteau de Chantilly, the home of the Prince de Cond on the outskirts of Paris.
Given the ornamental character of this drawing and the scene's relative lack of movement, court artist Francesco Primaticcio probably made it as a preparatory study for costume designs for a festival. The color notes that he included also support the idea of a costume design, since the assistants in his workshop would have needed such notes to faithfully re-create his design in fabric. Several of his other costume designs include elaborately decorated helmets such as the one this centaur wears. Primaticcio probably depicted only one element in a larger composition celebrating the popular story of the neighboring tribes of the centaurs and the Lapiths. According to classical mythology, the Lapiths invited the centaurs to their king's wedding, but the centaurs responded by carrying off the Lapith women-even the bride-under the influence of wine. The battle that ensued ended with the centaurs' defeat and expulsion from the Lapiths' country.
This intriguing sculpture was cast from the female head of the ancient marble statueCesi Juno(Rome, Capitoline Museum), which Michelangelo described as the most beautiful object in Rome. It may be one of the bronze casts after antique Roman statues that the French king Francis I commissioned from Primaticcio, his court artist, for the chteau at Fontainebleau, outside Paris;Double Headis depicted in a print of about 1650 above the entrance to a garden at Fontainebleau. It then passed to several famous collectors, including the 18th-century connoisseur Pierre Crozat and the 20th-century designer Yves Saint Laurent.
Seen from below, the imposing figure of Vulcan shows off his solid muscularity as he prepares to strike a blow on his anvil. The background figure, possibly an assistant or another version of Vulcan, reinforces the dramatic sense of impending movement. A broken, twisting outline artfully defines the figures and reveals an abstract beauty. Primaticcio may have intended to emphasize only the main lines of the design, for he barely noted the figures' interior modeling: short, expressive pen lines suffice, combined with subtle shadows and highlights.Primaticcio made this drawing as a preparatory study for the Ulysses Gallery at Fontainebleau, which he designed and Nicol dell'Abate and others executed. The Ulysses Gallery was entirely destroyed in 1739, and knowledge of it today depends on such preparatory drawings, copies, and written descriptions. Vulcan sat in one of the corners of the ceiling's second bay, making armor for Ulysses. The black chalk grid lines show that Primaticcio made this drawing late in the design process, just before his assistants used thesquaringto transfer the design to the wall.
Francesco Primaticcio made this drawing as a preparatory study for the last decorative project he planned, the central section of the chapel ceiling in the Htel de Guise, Paris. Nicol dell'Abate painted thefrescoesafter Primaticcio's designs. Unfortuntaely, the decoration was destroyed in the 1800s, and scholars can now only reconstruct it through written descriptions, prints, and drawings such as this one. The ceiling's central section showed God the Father in glory surrounded by angels. An apparently complete study in theLouvreMuseum shows the entire designsquaredfor transfer.With one exception, the studies of arms on this sheet reappear in the Louvremodello. In developing a project, Primaticcio probably began by establishing the composition as a whole and then developing the poses of individual figures. His next step might have been studies of details, like this sheet.
Borne aloft by two angels, the Virgin is crowned Queen of Heaven by Christ and God the Father. Below, Joseph on the left and Saint Francis on the right, identified by the stigmata on his open right hand, kneel and pose dramatically. Giulio Cesare Procaccini's figures are symmetrically positioned, giving balance to the composition, although the compressed bodies appear almost too large for the space they occupy.Swirling, shimmering draperies of brilliant pinks, yellows, blues, and violets enliven the composition and accentuate the otherworldliness of the subject matter. In comparison to the individualized faces of the saints below, the gestures and faces of the holy figures above are idealized.Procaccini bridged two stylistic periods in this painting. His virtuoso handling of paint and heightened emotionalism display Baroque tendencies, while his large, graceful figures and brilliantpaletteare holdovers from theManneristperiod.
Giulio Cesare Procaccini depicted the head of a woman whose gentle expression suggests the epitome of feminine gracefulness. He first drew her facial features with black chalk, then gently rubbed the chalk for added softness in some places. Next he rapidly sketched in her hair. He added broad strokes of white chalk to give her hair greater luminosity. Additional subtle white chalk provides highlights on her skin, whose tone is largely carried by the brown paper. His grace and soft technique follow in the tradition established by Correggio.On theverso, Procaccini modeled a smooth female torso that suggests the coolness and idealism of sculpture. Trained as a sculptor himself, Procaccini used his experience to render three dimensions on paper. A later owner of the drawing, who may have wanted to create a more pleasing frame for the study on therecto, probably cut down the sheet, removing the figure's head. Headless, the body even more emphatically recalls fragments ofclassicalsculpture.
Sculptor and painter Giulio Cesare Procaccini randomly covered a sheet of paper with differently scaled studies unified into a beautiful, integratedcomposition. This drawing displays his understanding of both the benefits and the limitations of the popular red chalk medium. He used the warmth and vitality of the red color to breathe life into his figures while recognizing that the red could not produce the illusion of depth achieved by shading in black chalk.Procaccini's curling rhythms and billowing forms, particularly in the female figure at the right, derive from Correggio, one of his chief sources of inspiration. Red chalk was one of Correggio's favorite media, and Procaccini emulated his soft textures and richly modeled surfaces here.
Two nude boys race their horses in this scene painted on the outside of a drinking cup. The horses are depicted with their front legs well off the ground and their bodies stretched forward, conveying their swift speed. The jockeys, in keeping with the pace, seem to barely hold on to the reins. They lean backward, their long hair flying behind in the breeze. A mazelikemeandersimulates the ground beneath the horses, and the pillars probably represent the race's start and finish lines. An inscription translated from Greek identifies one of the riders. It reads:  Leagros is beautiful. On the opposite side of the cup is a fragmentary image of a footrace. One runner stretches forward, his right leg and arm behind him.
The nude model's head tilts downward with closed eyes, conveying a sensual aura of dreaminess. The naturalistic texture of her hair, gathered in a bun with delicate curls framing her face, contrasts with the marblelike texture of her skin. Her pose, seated with her arm extended upward and illuminated from the upper left, almost certainly imitates antique sculpture.Pierre-Paul Prud'hon displayed his classical understanding of the female body in this intimate study, rendering the figure in a series of volumes--cylindrical legs and arms, conical breasts, triangular nose--with a softly yielding treatment of the skin achieved with short repetitive lines of hatching.
A dead man lies sprawled across the foreground while blood seeps into the ground from a wound in his neck and his murderer flees with the victim's belongings in his arms. Above, Divine Vengeance, illuminating the way with a torch, and Justice, armed with sword and scales, pursue the criminal. Pierre-Paul Prud'hon made this study for a monumental painting destined to hang behind the judges' bench in the criminal courtroom of the Palace of Justice in Paris.Prud'hon used quick, sweeping strokes of paint to lend movement and energy to the figures. Strong contrasts of light and dark accentuate the drama of the situation. Light from the moon illuminates the faces of the avenging personifications and highlights the torso of the dead man, while the face of the murderer is cast in darkness. Inspired by the Roman poet Horace's adage that   retribution rarely fails to pursue the evil man,  Prud'hon conveyed the message that the course of justice is relentless if sometimes slow.
A nearly life-sized woman in antique dress gazes fondly at something held in her unfinished right arm. With her exposed breast, this ideal woman mingles dream and sensuality, anticipatingRomanticism. The broad masses of light and shadow enhance the dreamlike effect.At the height of his career, Pierre-Paul Prud'hon made this nearly life-sized drawing as a model for a painting by his mistress and professional associate, Constance Mayer. The woman in the painting, titledThe Happy Mother,gazes adoringly at her nursing infant. Following the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who popularized and glorified maternity as a natural physical and emotional bond, both artists portrayed feminine tenderness. Such emotion set Prud'hon's imagery apart from hisNeoclassicalcontemporaries. Prud'hon preferred to draw with powdery applications of black and white chalk on blue or gray paper. Instead of using lines, he indicated contours of forms by stumping. Building up form by gradations of light created with white chalk, he explored the play of light on flesh.
This manuscript contains the texts used for masses on important feast days in the liturgical year, such as Christmas, Easter, and the Assumption of the Virgin. The manuscript's small scale suggests that a layperson used this book to follow along with the masses, and it was likely once part of a larger devotional text, probably a book of hours.Most of the mass texts begin with an image depicting the event from Christ's life or the saint that the feast celebrates. Many of the manuscript's miniatures were painted by the Pseudo-Jacquemart de Hesdin, who most likely worked at the court of Jean, duc de Berry from around 1380 until about 1410. The vibrant color palette, the soft modeling of figures, and the delicate gold ivy-leaf borders on each page in this manuscript are common both in the Pseudo-Jacquemart's work and in International style illumination from Paris.
Interrupting the Virgin at her reading, the angel Gabriel kneels before Mary holding a winding scroll that displays his message that she will bear the son of God. Gabriel gestures toward God who blesses the humble Virgin from above. The entire scene is set against the glittering gold, blue and red patterned background typical of French illumination around the year 1400, and a web of vines accented with ivy leaves surrounds the miniature. This image introduces a mass for the feast of the Annunciation in this book of hours.
Christemerges from his tomb with the help of an angel as the Roman soldiers sleep below. The wounds in Christ's hands and feet stand out against the paleness of his skin and his white garment. God looks on from above, indicating Christ's eventual Ascension into heaven.This image of theResurrectionintroduces themassforEasterSunday in thismanuscript.
The twelve apostles and the Virgin Mary gaze upward as Christ ascends into heaven. Only Christ's feet are visible as he disappears into the dark blue cloud at the top of the image. His footprints can still be seen imprinted on the rock below. The entire scene is set against a checkerboard of red, blue, and gold squares called a diapered ground, which was a common decorative motif in International style painting.This image precedes the prayers for the feast of the Ascension in a devotional book that was probably used by a layperson to follow along with the mass.
Saint John the Baptistsits in a lush landscape surrounded by animals that approach him gently. The lamb he holds in his lap is the Lamb of God, a symbol forChrist. The scene refers to the biblical story of Saint John's retreat into the desert, where he lived an ascetic life of prayer. The soft rendering of the animals' fur and the lush meadow showcases the Pseudo-Jacquemart de Hesdin's mastery of naturalistic detail.This image prefaces the feast of Saint John the Baptist, in honor of the saint who attracted the devotion of many medieval Christians. He and Saint Andrew are the only two saints for whom individual masses appear in thismanuscript.
Mary's mother, Anna, rests in her bed shortly after giving birth to the Virgin, while several female attendants care for her. At the lower right, one of the women prepares a bath for Mary. As an angel fills the tub, the attendant cradles the Virgin and tests the bath water with her fingertips.The Birth of the Virgin was an important feast in the Middle Ages, and this image precedes prayers for the mass on that day.
Joachim and Anne turn in surprise as an angel descends from above to tell them, despite their advanced age and their difficulty in conceiving a child, Anna will soon give birth to theVirgin Mary. The event takes place before a castlelike structure representing the Golden Gate, where the angel had instructed Joachim and Anne to meet.This image introduces themassfor the Conception of the Virgin, or the Immaculate Conception, a feast that was celebrated infrequently in the early 1400s. The text complements two other masses related to the Virgin in this book--the Birth of the Virgin and the Assumption of the Virgin--indicating that the book's owner may have had a particular devotion to Mary.
Psiax has been called an experimenter because of his work in many different varieties of vase decoration during the late sixth century B.C. This red-figure cup may be the first preserved example of a cup with a figuralfriezeon the outside instead of an eye-cup scheme, as in the Brygos Painter'sWine Cup with the Suicide of Ajax.On both on the interior and the exterior of the cup, Psiax painted erotically charged encounters between youths and men, and males and females. What makes this vase different is that he used incision and added-white in hisred-figure techniqueas well as added-red colors. On this cup, these techniques are joined by an extensive use of added-clayrelief. Thus, the lyre on side A has arms and a cross-piece painted in added color, much of which has flaked off, incised strings, and a raised sound box added in clay (now chipped). The leftmost youth sits on a camp stool which the artist added in clay relief. It has white hinges and is topped by what was once a red cushion. The surface of what was once apparently a brightly colored vase, perhaps enhanced withgilding, is now the beige color of the clay.
A young woman plays the double flutes on the front of thisblack-figuremastos or breast-shaped cup. The other side of the vase depicts a woman flourishing a branch and an ivy sprig. These objects, as well as the nebris or animal skin that she wears over one shoulder, identify this woman as amaenad, a female follower ofDionysos, the god of wine. A Dionysiac interpretation applies also to the flute-girl on the front of the mastos, who might be imagined playing for the god and his entourage, or perhaps for the humans honoring the god at asymposiumor drinking party.A mastos was designed for use at just such a symposium. The mastos was a relatively rare cup shape produced by Athenian potters only in the later 500s B.C. The shape fit in with the erotic pleasures of the symposium. Although the nipple on this mastos has been reconstructed, the potter would originally have put a pellet or bead into the nipple so that it rattled as the cup was being used, providing further entertainment.
Throughout his life, Pierre Puget expressed a fascination with ships and marine life, probably due to the fact that he was born and raised in the French port city of Marseilles. This detailed drawing of ships in a port is no exception. Here, two deckhands struggle to tether a large vessel, using fragments of a ruined pillar nearby. Another ship sits at anchor in the middle distance, and a half-finished hull is dry-docked to the right.Classicalruins incongruously decorate the far and near shores of the inlet.Puget's tight parallel lines in pen and ink contribute to the illusion of space, with distant details rendered in hazy chalk. Given hisbackground, it is not surprising that Puget designed and carved ship decorations for a living. He lavished attention on these features, especially the statues decorating the upper deck of the ship and its railings.
A marvel of artistry and engineering, Martin Puryear's sculpture rises on six slender legs to a height of forty-five feet above the broad expanse of travertine pavement on the plaza at the Getty Center. Stout strands of silver-patinated bronze bind the joints of the airy network of welded, sandblasted stainless steel tubes, two and three inches in diameter. Elegant in its apparent simplicity, the sculpture's complex structure reveals its true character only slowly. The sculpture's meaning likewise resists a fixed identity, suggesting both a delicate fishnet cast against the sky and a human head in profile. From some viewpoints, it appears to be fully round, but its south face is flat, while the north face curves gently through the air.That Profilewas commissioned by the Getty.
Scenes of the daily lives of Athenian schoolboys decorate thisred-figurecup. In addition to basic literacy and mathematics, Greek boys were trained in athletics and music. On the interior of the cup, a boy holding a lyre stands in front of a bearded man, who must be his music teacher. On the outside, men and boys form similar scenes. The imagined walls of the schoolroom are hung with musical instruments and athletic equipment: lyres, string bags with knucklebones, sponges, andaryballoi. The scenes on this cup are not purely educational, however. On one side of the vase, a boy holds a hare on his lap, while on the other, a man offers a hare to another boy. In addition to serving as a classroom, the gymnasion in its role as the center of Greek physical and intellectual life was also the center of romantic courtship. Hares were popular love gifts in the homosexual relationships between older men and boys favored by the Athenian aristocracy in the early 500s B.C.
Boats filled with cargo make their way down the Seine River. On the near shore, several boats have docked and are unloading while gentlemen conduct business near by. During the late 1700s Paris was a bustling commercial center, and market places like this one were becoming a common sight.On the right is the Pont Neuf, one of the oldest bridges in Paris. Behind the bridge, is a triangular bit of land, the Ile de la Cit; the twin towers of the faade of Ntre Dame are visible in the far distance. On the other side of the river is the Institute of France. Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Raguenet used a large horizontal format for his panoramic view, much like that used by Canaletto in his views of Venice. Grand Tourists often bought such urban views as souvenirs of their European travels.Raguenet specialized in views of Paris and owned a small shop for their sale in the rue de la Colombeon the Ile de la Cit. This view of Paris in the 1700s and its companion piece, View of Paris from the Pont Neuf, were probably made for an English patron, Lord Holland.
Horse-drawn carriages and strolling couples make their way across the Pont Neuf, one of the oldest bridges in Paris. Boats are tied up on both sides of the Seine River, a heavily traveled thoroughfare. In the center, behind an iron fence, stands an equestrian statue of Henri IV. On the right bank of the river is the Louvre, the national museum and art gallery of France. The dome of the Htel des Invalides can be seen on the left bank in the distance.Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Raguenet specialized in views of Paris and owned a small shop for their sale in the rue de la Colombeon the Ile de la Cit. This view of Paris in the 1700s and its companion piece, View of Paris with the Ile de la Cit, were probably painted for an English patron, Lord Holland.
On a simple stage set, an actor costumed as an old man removes the lid of a chest to reveal a bizarre child with a ram's head and a large erection. Looking bewildered, a second old man clasps the child's wrist. This strange scene probably represents a theatrical parody of the mythical birth of Erichthonios. In the myth, Hephaistos, the craftsman god, believing that the goddess Athena was attracted to him, attempted to have sex with her. When she resisted, some ofHephaistos'ssemen fell on her leg. She wiped it off with a piece of wool and threw it away, accidentally impregnating Ge, the earth. Athena cared for the resulting infant and kept him in a sacred basket on the Athenian Akropolis. In the theatrical version depicted on this vase, the elaborate doorway at the left of the stage probably representsAthena'stemple, and the ram's head on the child refers to the wool in the story.The scene on the front of thisApulianred-figurebell-krater depicts a phlyax play, a type of farce parodying mythology, popular in the Greek colonies in South Italy in the 300s B.C. The actors wear a distinctive costume of mask, tights, padded tunic, and large artificial phallus. The back of the vase bears a much less intriguing scene of three standing youths.
As if in response to a threat,Jupiter, the ruler of the pantheon of Roman gods, turns his muscular body and stands poised to hurl his thunderbolts. Accompanied only by his sacred bird the eagle and loosely covered only by a voluminous sheath, Jupiter focuses his eyes on the distance, lending a rare psychological tension to this unusually large bronze.Inspired by a famous ancient marble sculpture of Jupiter formerly in the Giustiniani Palace in Rome, the artist, possibly Jean Raon, retained theclassicalcontrappostopose: a relaxed but mobile body with opposed limbs. Jupiter raises his right arm and holds the left akimbo and stands with one leg forward and one back. Departing from his model, the artist emphasized the god's elegance and idealized anatomy. The bronze's glossypatinaallows the light to play gently over the figure's cascading drapery and the smoothly defined muscles of his chest and arms. Although the model was made about 1670, the sculpture was not cast in bronze until about 1680 to 1700. Itsclassicizingstyle links the work with sculpture made by FrenchAcademyartists for French royal residences such asVersailles.
In the center of the picture, Orpheus happily pulls along his wife  Eurydice after having won her release from Hades by his enchanting violin playing. Pluto, ruler of Hades, and his wife Proserpine observe their departure from the upper left. The three Fates ominously spin the future at the left, foreshadowing Orpheus's eventual unhappiness. He broke the one condition that Proserpine had set for Eurydice's return to earth: he could not look at her until their arrival. On reaching earthly light, Orpheus could not resist a glimpse, so Eurydice vanished forever.Jean Raoux painted the scene in a highly theatrical manner, spotlighting the figures and arranging them as if on a stage. The action seems especially compressed because the canvas was cut down on all sides early in the twentieth century.
The infant Christ Child reclines on pillows while the Virgin Mary lovingly gazes down at him. She holds a transparent veil in her hands towards which the child playfully extends his hands. In the shadows behind the Virgin, Joseph watches the happy scene. This intimate and touching view of the Holy Family exemplifies the Renaissance fascination with Jesus' humanity. The Virgin's beauty and youth, the child's pudgy body, and their warm smiles enhance the sense of the Holy Family as ordinary, loving, and ultimately very human.Pope Julius II may have commissioned the painting in 1509, hanging it on a pillar, along with his portrait, during festivals in a Roman church. Thirty-five known versions of this painting exist, making it one of Raphael's most popular Madonnas.
This woman holds atibia, a reed pipe that was the principal wind instrument of most ancient peoples. In her relaxed contrapposto pose, this figure reflects the new interest in classical antiquity that marked Renaissance art. Scholars have attributed the drawing to the young Raphael Sanzio. His classicism exhibited calmness and grace as well as an interest in selective emphasis of details; here he subtly focused on the woman's chin and left leg. His work also revealed floating, melodic lines, such as the one that defines the woman's body from shoulder to foot.
An unknown man, cool and contained, stands proudly in front of a prosperous landscape that may include a portrait of his own residence. The fine yet restrained clothes, direct gaze, and proud bearing characterize the newRenaissanceemphasis on individualism. The three-quarter turn of the body, with his arm forming the base of the triangular composition, became a popular pose in that era; not incidentally, it draws attention to the man's ring and the fine Middle Eastern carpet covering the table.
In this preliminary study for hisDisputafresco in the Vatican, Raphael Sanzio rendered several of the figures with extraordinary clarity and economy. The central philosopher turning intently away from the viewer, the ghostly hooded figure on the right, and the men in animated discussion behind all appear in detail. Raphael varied the lines from the squiggles of the philosopher's hair to the straight folds of the standing monk's cloak, which seem to barely touch the page. This sheet also reveals the artist's thought process as he worked up the main figure from the nude, carefully manipulating the anatomical details so as to provide a believable structure and volume for the completely draped figure in the fresco.The verso contains three even quicker sketches of the philosopher, along with an earlier idea for the young man who turns outward in the fresco's left foreground.
In 1515 Pope Leo X commissioned Raphael to make cartoons for a series of ten tapestries to decorate the lower walls of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. Raphael made this drawing as a study for the figure of Saint Paul in theSacrifice at Lystra, one of the ten tapestries illustrating the Acts of the Apostles.The apostle Saint Paul tears his garment in anger at the people of Lystra in Asia Minor, who had prepared a sacrificial offering to the apostle and Saint Barnabas. After the two saints had miraculously cured a lame man, the people of Lystra believed that Paul and Barnabas were the pagan gods Mercury and Jupiter. The expression on Saint Paul's face and the contortion of his body convey his anguish at the pagan offering.In this drawing Raphael used the metalpoint technique. This laborious technique requires the utmost skill: once a line is drawn in metalpoint, it is very difficult to remove or correct it.
Working from a live model, Raphael Sanzio used a range of techniques to draw this figure. Below the billowing drapery, he quickly sketched Christ's legs, but he subtly modeled the torso above in a fluid,painterlyfashion, achieving this effect with a brush and wash. He drew the legs in first, and the lines of the figure remain visible underneath Christ's drapery. He defined the figure's monumental, round forms with economy, using black chalk to emphasize contours as well as to create richchiaroscuroeffects.
Assuming the view of a passenger aboard the Pennsylvania Railroad, William H. Rau made this panoramic photograph overlooking a bend in the Conemaugh River. Though the area appears untouched by humans, the tracks of the railroad are just visible at the far right-a suppressed detail within the pastoral landscape. As an official photographer for the Pennsylvania Railroad in the 1890s, Rau was specifically directed by the company to select interesting views. This attractive image of a glassy, meandering river could have served as a company advertisement.
Calm waters fill the foreground of the image, action takes place in the middle ground, and an empty sky fills the upper third of this print. William Rau often used such a three-part arrangement in his formally composed photographs.Though the purpose of the photograph was to document the Lehigh Valley Railroad's coal piers, an engineering innovation, Rau also captured two sailing vessels. On the left, a small boat moves away from the shore. On the right, the three tall masts of a larger docked ship extend past the top of the coal pier. While it illustrates the new, mechanized form of transportation that evolved during the industrial revolution, the image also presents a traditional form of sea travel.
Positioning his camera directly in the path of an approaching train, William H. Rau made this bold composition of three parallel tracks converging at a bend along the Lehigh Valley Railroad. He framed the photograph so that the peripheral tracks enter the composition in the left and right corners of the foreground, receding toward the center of the composition. He placed the signal light, rather than the steam engine, in the direct center of the image. Beside the signal light, a railway worker stands with a hands on one hip. The photograph, which was probably made for railway advertising purposes, also shows the scenic beauty of rural Pennsylvania.
Before the coming of the railroad in America, ladies' dresses and gentlemen's watches were invariably products of some cottage industry. Soon after the arrival of the railroad, businesses became dependent upon trains to rapidly move both raw and finished goods to market. The railroad made a nationwide system of manufactures possible. In heavily industrial areas such as mining or manufacturing centers, trains literally stopped at a business's  back door  to load products in the most efficient manner. This photograph of tracks running directly through a mining area illustrates the tight connection between the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania coal mining industry.
When William H. Rau photographed this massive iron bridge in Whitford, Pennsylvania, it was a vital part of the Pennsylvania Railroad's line between the southeastern part of the state and Philadelphia. Rau set up his camera so that the lower tracks recede into the distance straight ahead while the bridge crosses diagonally above them. This angle allowed him to fully depict the bridge's structure, which still exists, though without any railroad tracks.As official photographer for the Pennsylvania Railroad, Rau documented many of the company's engineering achievements. This image demonstrates his interests in the formal aspects ofcompositionand in depicting the relation of the railroad to the land.
The uprightsecrtairebegan to be a fashionable form around the mid-1700s, when letterwriting became a popular pastime. Themarchands-mercierswere quick to respond to this demand, providing many types of small tables or desks with interiors fitted for storing writing tools. The front lowers to form a writing surface, revealing drawers and pigeonholes.Until his death in 1785, Martin Carlin was thebnistemost frequently employed by themarchands-merciersto mount porcelain plaques on furniture; this piece is likely to have been made for one of them. This expensive form of decoration began around 1760 and became extremely fashionable within ten years. In addition to the porcelain plaques, the gilt bronze mounts in the form of drapery swags and the hanging oak branches are also typical of Carlin's work.
Thisminiaturedepicts a monumental crucifiedChrist, recalling the bulky, heroic male nudes of Michelangelo, against thebackgroundof a vast atmospheric landscape and billowing clouds. Inscribed at the top of the frame is a response from the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross:  You who suffered for us, OJesusChrist, have pity on us.  At the bottom is an antiphon from the same feast: We adore you, Christ, and we bless you because [by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.] The artist, Vincent Raymond, who was French by origin, worked in Rome for decades. In 1549 he was finally appointed papalilluminatorunder Paul III. This miniature comes from a missal perhaps made for that pontiff.
Gazing out hypnotically, the Baronne de Domecy appears removed from the material world, both physically and emotionally. The contrast between the sitter's monochromatic face and the explosion of multicolored, dreamlike flowers emphasizes the baroness' state of withdrawal and reverie. Neither entirely stylized nor precisely defined, the almost hallucinatory flora seems to float on the portrait's surface, as if projecting the sitter's inner vision. Do these flowers spring forth from the earth or from the depths of the imagination Odilon Redon executed this pastel portrait of the wife of hispatronand friend, Baron Robert de Domecy, shortly after he had completed an ambitious cycle of decorative paintings for their chteau. The unconventional portrait likeness combines a delicate pencil rendering of the sitter's face, the tan paper ground serving as her  skin,  with thickly applied red and blue pastel for her clothing. The muted blues of her jacket seem to bleed into the adjacent flowers, bridging sitter and surroundings. Reflecting Redon's fascination with underwater life, these prevalent blues, alongside notes of green and purple, also conjure up an aquatic world with its hidden depths and elusive meanings.
This gruesome scene depicts the unpleasant job of burying the remains of fallen Union soldiers from the June 1864 battles of Gaines' Mill and Cold Harbor. This task has fallen to a group of black men doing the menial work while a white man standing at upper left acts as overseer. The man seated in the center, next to the stretcher laden with human parts, looks directly at the camera, revealing no emotion that can be reconciled with his grisly cargo.Already reduced to nothing more than a pile of bones, these bodies lay unburied for ten months until the war's end, while the blistering heat and humidity of the Virginia summer hastened their decomposition. Local residents usually came forth to give a proper burial to the enemy troops that fell near their homes, but the scale of the casualties here--nearly sixty thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded in this area--precluded this courtesy.
The river Seine is a polished mirror: not a ripple or wave disturbs the glassy surface of the water. Though they are the only contemporary clues in an otherwise timeless setting, the boats moored at the center do not seem like vessels of travel at all as they jut out from the banks like low-lying docks. Everything is quiet in this scene. Although the sun dances in shadows across the path, gently kissing with light the building simply labeledDupre,not a single passer-by strolls along. Seemingly no one is awake except the photographer, quietly recording the landscape and town at rest.
Oscar Rejlander's photograph could be read as a metaphor of his own career. The additional  brush  or image-making tool provided by photography to painters was evident from the beginnings of the medium. Many early practitioners arrived at photography from painting, as did Rejlander. Photographs were often thought of and used as sketching tools for painters. Although photographs never managed to signal the death of painting as initially predicted, they did frequently assume the function that drawing had traditionally held in relation to painting.Compositionally, this is an unusual photograph. Rejlander employs anarrativedevicefrom painting: the use of figures, or parts of figures, asallegoricalrepresentations for ideas. A very young child represents the infant medium of photography. The Painter appears only as a hand extending into the frame at the upper left, although the traditional arts are also represented by the sculpture reproduction in the lower left corner. The Infant Photography, identified by the camera on which the child supports himself, faces away from the camera, his features totally obscured. The mirror behind the child gives a clear reflection of Rejlander at his camera, making this image.
In his bold, vigorous, and economical style, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn examined this man's pensive face from two directions. He presented the eyes as dark caverns, with shadows alone defining the ear, cleverly allowing the blank paper to do the rest. Broad pen strokes develop areas such as the neck, shoulder, and back of the head.Rembrandt often preferred to draw and paint older figures, subjects whose greater life experiences showed in their faces. As a French scholar wrote in 1909,  He is there when we are old, when we look fixedly at the side of the night that comes. 
An elderly man in a subdued green velvet cloak trimmed in fur instructs a boy wearing a lavish Eastern costume. The artist presents a study in contrasts: the student's youthfulness, his smooth complexion, lavish garments, and quest for knowledge are balanced against the learned man's aged, weathered face as he imparts wisdom. A warm light that accentuates the tonal contrasts and rich textures of the velvet and satin fabrics bathes the two figures. Light catches and shimmers off the precious stones of the boy's gold jewelry. Fine, precise brushstrokes enhance the overall impression of softness.The subjects are presented in the guise of historical personages, possibly portraying the youthful Old Testament prophet Samuel with his instructor Eli. The use of lavish costumes and light and dark contrasts reveal the influence of Rembrandt.
Using only pen and ink, which shows every mistake, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn created the space and volume of an artist's studio with a spare use of line. He drew the easel and the painting first, as the point of reference for the artist and the other objects. He later added the perspective lines that converge beyond the right edge of the paper; they served to confirm his intuition about the correct construction of objects in space. The heavier reinforcing lines at the bottoms of the chair and easel indicate adjustments to their placement.Some scholars have labeled this drawing as a self-portrait in which Rembrandt himself views a panel from a distance, developing a mental image of the whole picture before he begins to work. Alternatively, other scholars argue that it depicts Rembrandt's friend and fellow Leiden artist Jan Lievens, who began his pictures by making a rough sketch in paint directly on the canvas.
In theMetamorphoses, the ancient Roman poet Ovid told a story about the god Jupiter, who disguised himself as a white bull in order to seduce the princess Europa away from her companions and carry her across the sea to the distant land that would bear her name.During his long career Rembrandt rarely painted mythological subjects. Here he conveys a narrative story through dramatic gesture and visual effects. Bewildered, Europa grasps the bull's horn, digs her fingers into his neck, and turns back to look at her companions on the water's edge. One young woman falls to the ground and raises her arms in alarm, dropping the flower garland intended for the bull's neck into her lap, while her friend clasps her hands in consternation and watches helplessly. The carriage driver above rises to his feet and stares at the departing princess in horror. In the background, a city shrouded in mist extends along the horizon, perhaps serving as an allusion to the ancient city of Tyre as well as to contemporary Amsterdam.The dark thicket of trees to the right contrasts with the pink and blue regions of the sea and sky. Sunlight breaks through the clouds and reflects off the water, but the sky behind the trees is dark and foreboding.A master of visual effects, Rembrandt took pleasure in describing the varied textures of sumptuous costumes and glittering gold highlights on the carriage and dresses.
Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn communicated the emotional exchange between these two people with economy and force. He clearly demonstrated the man's stern admonishment as he turns to face the woman's darkened gaze. Concentrating on both faces and the man's hands--the carriers of the drama--Rembrandt used only a few calligraphic strokes to describe the pair's clothing and give them a sense of three-dimensionality. He also engaged the paper, making the blank areas as active in describing the scene as the lines themselves. Even in a rapid sketch, Rembrandt created a sense of narrative, drama, and character.Rembrandt may have depicted an early event in the Old Testament story of the prophet Samuel. When Samuel's future mother Hannah moved her lips while silently praying to God to give her children, the high priest Eli reproached her, thinking she was drunk.
Who is this woman  She stands nude, squeezing her breast with one hand while holding a large snake behind her with her other hand. The snake, the headdress, and her bared breast suggest that Rembrandt meant to depictCleopatra, although recent scholars have suggested that the figure has certain aspects of Eve. In fact, Rembrandt used this drawing as the basis for his depiction of Eve in his drawing and subsequent etchingAdam and Eveof 1638.Rembrandt applied red chalk energetically, describing the swell of  the woman's belly with strong horizontal strokes. Vertical shading along her legs conveys her body's taut strength. He also exploited the brilliance and luminosity of the red chalk by applying whitegouacheunderneath it, particularly in the woman's arm and torso. The glowing quality of the red chalk with white underneath and the solid three-dimensionality of form create a sense of energy radiating from her.
While imprisoned, Joseph, shown here standing to the left, interpreted the dreams of the Pharaoh's butler and baker, also thrown into jail for offending their master. Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn conveyed the moment when the baker, in a flat cap, discovers that Pharaoh will have him hanged in three days. The butler, who learns that he will be restored to his position, leans forward, hands clasped, listening intently. Joseph's predictions for these two came true, and his interpretation of Pharaoh's dream saved all of Egypt two years later.As with most of his compositional studies of religious subjects, Rembrandt probably made this drawing not as a preparatory study for a project but for its own sake. His working methods were highly experimental; he himself may have joined together the two sheets of paper that comprise this drawing. On one sheet he developed detailed studies of the butler and baker; on the other he captured Joseph with the fewest pen marks possible. Rembrandt used iron-gall ink, originally black but now faded to brown.
Around 1640, Rembrandt van Rijn made five drawings, similar in setting and technique, of these two thatched cottages. Unlike most of his landscapes, this drawing almost entirely eschews atmospheric effects in favor of building up monumental architectural and textural forms with bold strokes of the quill pen. The larger house's monumentality and detail contrasts with the cursory jottings that compose the neighboring house and the few squiggly lines that indicate the earth.As always, Rembrandt drew only what was essential. His animated line moved vigorously across the sheet, creating rich and varied effects of texture and surface. At this point in his career, Rembrandt delighted in exploring the visual impact of varied, dense lines, as seen in the moss growing in the thatched roof of the nearest house. Rembrandt's bold quill pen work here brings to mind the work of Vincent van Gogh two-and-a-half centuries later.
Moments after the apostles turned away the Canaanite woman, Christ listened to her demonstration of faith and healed her daughter of demonic possession. The two areas of focus in this drawing correspond to these two main characters, as yet separated--Christ in the center and the Canaanite woman in an exchange with an apostle at the left. The onlookers behind and beneath the woman and the indeterminate projection at the left add depth and foreground to the scene.Modeling his figures with fine hatching, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn displayed a wide variety in the width and character of his lines. Correcting and altering the composition as he worked, he partially blotted out one of the onlookers' faces and covered Christ's left hand and foot with whitebodycolor. The lightly sketched landscape at the right typifies Rembrandt's characteristic use of space and light, easily suggested with ink alone. In the 1640s, Rembrandt preferred to draw directly with pen and ink, unlike most of his contemporaries, who began their drawings with preliminary pencil or chalk sketches, then covered over those lines with ink.
While Christ sits humbly on a platform, wearing the punishing crown of thorns and a borrowed robe, a soldier mocks him by kneeling in salute, saying,  Hail, King of the Jews!  Other soldiers look on, more concerned with their own conversation, perhaps deciding how to orchestrate Christ's imminent crucifixion.A pupil of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn first outlined this composition in a pale ink, then went over it in a darker ink to correct and emphasize parts of the group on the left. Although Mark's Gospel set the scene in the courtyard of the governor's headquarters, the artist purposefully left much of the page blank, isolating the figures in a void and forcing the psychological meaning and dramatic interplay among the participants to dominate. The large group at the left sets apart, both emotionally and in space, the resigned Christ and the soldier who taunts him.
The flatness and broad, horizontal expansiveness of the Dutch landscape is punctuated by a lone sailboat. A gentle breeze blows to the right, agitating the rushes, and filling the sail of the boat. The vista opens to the right where a small peninsula of land, a house, and sensitively rendered architectural forms appear on the horizon.To the left, a mass of bulrushes balances thecomposition. In this area, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn modeled the reeds using wash; to simulate nuances of sunlight and shadow, he left portions of the paper blank. The pen strokes are varied, changing from rapid, thin touches to broader strokes that emphasize the marshy area and sailboat.
Around 1650 Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn made a number of pen-and-ink drawings and etchings of wooded scenes. He emphasized certain elements, subordinated others, and gave each landscape both unity and a poetic effect. Here he drew the trees with quick, thin strokes of the quill pen, suggesting their forms rather than specifically describing them. To emphasize the bulk of the tree at the left, he drew it darker and scratched through the paper's brown-tinted surface to create the white highlights.About ten years earlier, Rembrandt had begun drawing many landscapes. He roamed the area around Amsterdam, creating drawings and etchings that captured the Dutch countryside and its light and atmosphere, always with an economy of technique. As in this informal drawing, his landscapes express spontaneity and freshness while appearing like complete representations of the scenes he observed.
On his excursions outside of Amsterdam, Rembrandt van Rijn frequently followed the waterways, drawing and later etching these flat Dutch landscapes. Rather than aiming for a detailed reproduction, Rembrandt emphasized only the important elements. He eliminated parts, giving the viewer no more than was necessary to see and feel what he himself saw and felt. Even though this view along the Schinckel River is topographically accurate and scholars have identified the house with the tower, it is Rembrandt's economy of means that makes the drawing enchanting.Rembrandt suggested space, light, and atmosphere by relying on blank paper and using a few exquisitely placed accents. A delicate wash over fine, short strokes creates a blurred and luminous effect in the mass of trees. A fine dotting technique further animates this area, giving the sense of a slight breeze passing across the treetops. A few broad lines transform the foreground into river and land, and scattered strokes at the lower left embody the rushes and their reflections. Even more subtly, a passage of dots and wash leads into the far distance beyond the house at the left.
Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn made twenty-five  Indian drawings,  based on miniatures from the Mughal Empire that he saw in a Dutch collection and presumably studied over a long period. Adopting some aspects of the extremely precise manner of these miniatures--so unlike his usual loose, evocative style of draftsmanship--Rembrandt nonetheless enlivened the figures' poses by giving them more sense of action than did the Mughal style. Despite their looseness, his lines present the figures in the three-quarter body and profile head view common in Indian painting.A contemporary of Rembrandt known for his building campaigns and as a patron of art, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan is recognizable from his characteristic dress and face--and the aureole, which distinguished portrayals of Mughal rulers beginning with his father's reign. This depiction resembles the many portraits in the illustrated history that Shah Jahan commissioned of his reign. In characteristic Mughal fashion, he rather stiffly faces his eldest and most beloved son, Dara Shikoh. The falcon represents the popular courtly sport of hunting, often depicted in Mughal art.
Made just eight years before Rembrandt's death, this painting depicts Saint Bartholomew holding a knife in his right hand, a reference to the fact that he was skinned alive when martyred. One of Rembrandt's neighbors may have posed as the model for the saint. By showing the apostle as a common man, Rembrandt gave the revered holy figure a tangible human quality, suggesting perhaps that holiness is part of daily life, a view in keeping with the religious atmosphere of mid-1600s Amsterdam.Saint Bartholomew appears pensive, almost melancholy in mood. He holds his chin as if lost in thought and his eyes seem to see beyond time. Rembrandt used a broader, freely-brushed technique typical of his late mature style. Applied with a palette knife, thick areas of paint calledimpastoare visible on the saint's forehead, nose, ears, and hands. The overall handling of paint is much more expressive and contrasts with the smoother, more precise style of his earlier works.
The subject, who appears in different guises in several other paintings by Rembrandt van Rijn and his contemporaries, wears a plumed hat and metal breastplate. His military costume may symbolize Dutch strength and patriotism during the struggle for independence from Spain. Although he faces front, the man's torso is turned in a three-quarter view; his watery eyes gazing off to the side give the image a sense of immediacy.Rembrandt deftly captured the contrasting textures of materials: the downiness of the ostrich feather, the velvety softness of the cap, and the smooth coldness of the metal breastplate. The furrowed skin around the bridge of the man's nose, the moistness of his eyes, and the wispiness of his mustache and beard map out the physical process of aging.
When King Cyrus of Persia, seen at the center, asked his confidant Daniel why he does not worship the deity Bel, whose lower half can be seen in the shadows, Daniel replied that he worshipped a living god, not an idol. The king insisted that Bel was a living god and pointed to the offerings of food and wine that Bel consumed every night. Cautiously, Daniel noted that bronze statues do not eat. Cyrus was momentarily bewildered, but the worried faces of the priests in the background confirm that Daniel has exposed their deception. This story of Daniel's dramatic exposure of the king's idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel.Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the king's grandeur with Daniel's humility. Facing out and gesturing toward the table, the lavishly attired Cyrus appears large and imposing. By contrast, the youthful Daniel seems small, and his posture suggests modesty or submissiveness before his ruler. Rembrandt evoked the exotic mystery of a pagan cult by showing only part of the monumental idol emerging from the flickering lamplight on the right. Inside the shadowy temple, light catches and reflects off the extravagant finery worn by Cyrus and the gold vessels placed atop the velvet tablecloth.
When the roll-top is raised, a writing slide may be pulled forward, revealing dummy drawer fronts that match the interior desk drawers above. Additional writing slides pull out at the sides, perhaps for assistants to take dictation. The desk was originally designed to sit in the middle of a room, where it could be seen from all sides; the gilt bronze mounts that decorate the lowerfriezeonce continued around the back.ThebnisteBernard Molitor, who made this desk, received many commissions from the French court. Although scholars are unsure exactly who commissioned this grand piece, an entry in a sale catalogue of 1800, when it was sold at auction, described it as having come from the royal chteau of Saint-Cloud. A further clue to its original owner are the very small fleurs-de-lis, symbol of the monarchy, stamped on the drawer handle of the center drawer.
Made in theNeoclassicalstyle, this monumental rolltop desk is fitted with numerous complicated mechanical devices, the specialty of David Roentgen's workshop. When the writing surface is pulled out, a mechanism automatically withdraws the solid rolltop back into the carcass, displaying the drawers and pigeon holes inside the desk. Behind the large gilt bronze plaque in the middle of the top is a contraption of many parts that moves out and opens at the turn of a key. It contains a folding reading and writing stand with compartments that hold an inkwell and sand pot for use by a person standing at the closed desk.
This clock was one of the most popular models produced by the German workshop run by David Roentgen and Peter Kinzing. The case is covered with a simple maple veneer, while gilt bronzemountssymbolizing Time add decoration around the clock face: Chronos (Father Time) supports the clock dial, and the passage of the year is marked by the garland over the dial, with its flowers for spring, wheat for summer, grapes for autumn, and holly leaves for winter. The faces of day and night are shown around thefrieze, and the whole is crowned with a lyre, symbol of the sun godApollowho oversees the passage of Time. Although the clock once played a tune when it chimed, this movement no longer works.Several other existing clocks include a large gilt bronze statue of Apollo playing his lyre on the top; as there are holes on the top of the case, such a figure probably once adorned this clock too.Johann Wilhelm Weyl created the musical mechanism for this clock.
This intimate drawing captures the close relationship between a mother and child. Guido Reni emphasized the Holy Family's humanity and the infant's love and neediness, not his divinity as the Christ. Although a lightly drawn Joseph and an angel look on, they do not inhabit the same space as the more substantial mother and child, and neither Mary nor Jesus acknowledges their presence.Scholars are uncertain about the purpose of this drawing. The hatched lines indicating shading hint that Reni may have made it with an etching in mind, though none survives. He at least considered an oval format, for his curved lines round off all four corners of the design, echoing Mary's embracing arms and bowed head.
After the young Joseph's jealous brothers sold him into slavery, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, purchased him as a household slave. Realizing his abilities, Potiphar soon made Joseph overseer of the household.Potiphar's wife also recognized the young man's talents and tried to seduce him. Shown here, she clutches at Joseph's robes and begs him to make love to her. Joseph refuses, raises his left hand as if to shield himself from her, and turns to flee. The two figures are caught in a struggle: Joseph pulls back while the seductress reaches out to grasp his cloak. Flowing, shimmering draperies and the figure's gestures express Joseph's entrapment, both by Potiphar's wife and by the cloak. In his haste, he will leave his cloak behind in her hands; humiliated, she will accuse Joseph of attempted rape, using the cloak as evidence.
Though drawing the holy subject of the Virgin and Child, Guido Reni simply captured the intimacy of a woman cradling her infant. Other than their attractiveness, he gave no indication that this baby or this woman was divine. When he later painted the group asTheHoly Family Adored by Saints Elizabeth and John the Baptist, he idealized the figures more and made them more majestic to indicate their biblical importance.Using sharp, rather scratchy strokes and a somewhat irregular use of red chalk, Reni sketched the Virgin's face, the center of the group, and her foot. Artists often combined red and black chalks to suggest color distinctions associated with faces, hair, costumes, and other details. Reni's judicious use of white against the light paper gives the effect of the Virgin's drapery shimmering in the light.On the verso, Reni sketched a turban such as a sibyl might wear, with the barest indication of earrings and a scarf.
In this depiction of a meeting between the young Christ and Saint John the Baptist, Guido Reni eliminated unnecessary detail and concentrated on the scene's emotional qualities. The eyes of the two children meet as Mary looks on. The doves that the Christ Child gives to his cousin are an allusion to both Jesus's future role as the King of Peace as well as his eventual sacrifice. Joseph enters through a doorway in the background.Although using oil, Reni applied his color with the broad brushwork of fresco painting. He outlined important details with dark, jagged strokes. It was once thought that the sketchy appearance of Reni's late works meant that they were unfinished, but like many aging artists, Reni pared form and color to the bare essentials for purely expressive purposes.Lost for centuries, this painting reappeared in the possession of a family in Michigan who sold it to the Getty Museum in 1984.
What Pierre-August Renoir himself titled this painting is unknown, butLa Promenadeis in part an homage to earlier artists that he greatly admired. Renoir had spent the previous summer painting outdoors with Claude Monet, who encouraged him to move toward a lighter, more luminouspaletteand to indulge his penchant for luscious, feathery brushwork. Here Renoir retained something of Gustave Courbet's green-and-brown palette while choosing his subject from the sensual, lighthearted garden jaunts of eighteenth-century painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honor Fragonard, whose works he had studied in theLouvre.Unlike the images of seduction created by his predecessors, Renoir's is a fleeting moment caught by chance--middle-class Parisians immersed in nature, possibly a local park, not set before a studio backdrop. The dappled light filtering through the foliage would become a trademark of Renoir's finestImpressionistworks of the 1870s and 1880s. He used a thin, oily paint mix, his glazes here floating into each other to create depth.
Pierre-Auguste Renoir depicted the self-assured composer Albert Cahen d'Anvers, a former pupil of Csar Franck, nonchalantly smoking a cigarette at a friend's home. Traditionally, portraits of men were somber, but Renoir combined decorativeness with fidelity to his sitter's appearance. Facial hair was regarded as a powerful indicator of male sexuality, and Renoir shows Cahen d'Anvers's curled mustache echoing the wallpaper's curves, his ruffled red hair referring to the potted plant's feathery leaves. Cahen d'Anvers's authority and status are suggested through his alert, commanding gaze and details such as his elaborate cigarette holder and cravat.Renoir hoped that success in portraiture would lead to success in the wider potential market attracted by the Salon. Twenty years into his career, he had become so disenchanted with Impressionism that he called the movement a  blind alley.  He modified his style, combining the loose, painterly effects of early works such asLa Promenadewith Renaissance painting's firm contours and weighty forms. He began receiving portrait commissions, often from wealthy Jewish patrons. Only a year after making this portrait, however, his uncertainty about achieving his aims through portraiture and his increasing anti-Semitism meant that portraiture no longer appeared so promising to him.
A deliberate homage to an earlier artistic style that Guido Rey admired, thecompositionderives from a painting made by Dutch artistJan Vermeerin the 1600s. In this posed scene, a young suitor bearing flowers approaches a woman seated at her writing desk, with her pen poised in mid-air as she turns to greet him. A leaded glass window opens into her room, providing a natural light source for the photograph's illumination. The mounted corner clock, decorative jar on the desk, and painting on the wall were Rey's everyday household items or objects borrowed from friends, carefully chosen for period accuracy. Likewise, a seamstress who lived in the attic of Rey's home in Turin created the costumes to his specifications.
Tumbling angels support theVirgin Maryas she graciously accepts the crown asQueen of Heaven. During the mid-1660s, theCoronation of the Virginwas a very popular subject in Catholic circles, especially in Spain. Francisco Ribalta treated the theme with remarkable dynamism and originality. He appliedwashto strengthen the vigorous pen work and to unite thecomposition. The arched upper section suggests that he made the drawing in preparation for an altar painting.
Jusepe de Ribera chose an unusual arrangement for his powerful composition of a frequently depicted subject. The Magi, wise men from the East, and their attendants crowd into a small space around the Virgin Mary and the newborn Christ Child. As the wise man on the right kneels down humbly to pay his respects, however, the one on the left seems to stand apart grimacing. Another, at the back of the scene, impolitely turns away completely, showing only the back of his head to the Mother and Child. Joseph has already taken one of the gifts, offering it to his wife, who grabs it eagerly.
Jusepe de Ribera not only contrasted the sizes of the gigantic potentate and his dwarf halberd bearer but also juxtaposed their somewhat disheveled appearance with their grandiloquent poses. This caricature-like representation displays Ribera's usual strain of irony and frequent combination of figures of differing scale.The striking crimson ink underscores the outlandish qualities of Ribera's subject matter. To make the ink, the artist probably used a dye made from the cochineal insect, a relative of the mealybug. He also applied his ink somewhat unconventionally, in tremulous, undulating lines made with the point of a brush.Ribera neither inscribed nor squared the drawing himself. Sometime after his death, another craftsman probably considered transferring the design to an engraving plate.
Emerging from deep shadows behind a table, a solemn individual stands displaying a well-worn book with various geometric figures, pseudo-Greek characters, and an imaginary script. Jusepe de Ribera paid considerable attention to the man's facial details, from the unkempt beard to the distinctive creases of his high forehead and the irregular folds of the lids above his dark, penetrating eyes. He depicted the wise man with tattered clothes and blackened, grimy fingers to emphasize the subject's devotion to intellectual, rather than material, pursuits.The presence of mathematical diagrams in the illegible book reveal the figure's identity as Euclid, a prominent mathematician from antiquity, best known for his treatise on geometry, theElements. Portraits of wise men were very popular in the 1600s, when there was a revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy. Rather than portraying the subject as a refined and noble figure, Ribera depicted him as an individual tried by a life of hardship, imbued with the force of a living personality.
After he returned to Italy from England in 1716 with his uncle and partner Sebastiano Ricci, Marco Ricci adopted the rare technique of applyinggouacheto dark brown tanned leather as his preferred method of drawing. In this gouache sketch on leather, Ricci took advantage of the skin's dark color to emphasize the ominous storm. The thinner applications of paint in the sky leave some of the leather visible, increasing the visual weight of the angry clouds. He copiously used lead white to make hispigmentsopaque, and the resulting lack of transparency in light reflecting off the water and sky gives the scene a chilling luminosity. The frightening storm and threat of doom--natural phenomena become fearsome--satisfied the aesthetic notion of the Sublime, the idea that images or words describing danger provided a pleasurable experience for viewers or readers, a vicarious thrill of terror enjoyed in the safety of a drawing room.
Marco Ricci focused this evocative, carefully finished landscape on people going about their daily business in the spacious outdoors. Two gentlemen ride in comfort, chatting animatedly as the postilion riding on the near horse guides the team of horses. By using a lighter tone for the middle distance, where another group of travelers descends the hill, Ricci conveyed the expansive feeling of traveling by carriage in the open air and hinted at the balmy atmosphere. Drawing even more lightly, he suggested a town in the background as a destination.Scholars are uncertain whether Ricci made this composition as a study for a painting or print or an independent, finished work of art. He repeated the same scene with differing details and a higher viewpoint in a later painting. Two etchings, including one made posthumously by Ricci's nephew, repeat the drawing's design almost exactly.
In this fantastic vista, Marco Ricci combined ancient Roman monuments, such as an obelisk, sections of temples, and statues, to create a scene both picturesque and evocative of the power of the ancient world. In the last decade of his life, Ricci specialized in such theatrical views and repeatedly used the same monuments in different arrangements. As usual, his uncle Sebastiano Ricci painted the rustic figures, which are nearly lost amidst the colossal ruins.Joseph Smith, an English businessman and consul who lived in Venice for many years and became one of the greatest art patrons of his day, once owned this painting.
During the war between the Romans and the Sabines in about 290 B.C., Tarquin, king of Rome, challenged Attius Navius, a fortuneteller, to read his mind. When Navius declared that Tarquin's thought would be accomplished, Tarquin revealed that he thought Navius would cut a whetstone in half with a razor, which he did immediately. Sebastiano Ricci took this subject from Livy'sHistory of Rome,first published in A.D. 14, but he showed Navius cutting a column, a more aesthetic object.Ricci pared the composition down to its dramatic essentials--two large figures making eloquent gestures--and added a recognizable setting and bystanders to create a sense of community. The slightly shadowed mother and child is a typical Ricci motif. Effectively employing the usual Roman Baroque sense of dramatic light and color, he adopted Giovanni Battista Gaulli's strong, rather hot colors for the costumes and the sky. He also adopted the characteristic faces of the child and the man on the extreme left from Gaulli.
Rather than being engaged in a heroic mythological story, this Diana, goddess of the moon, simply rests languidly in a world of her own. Lost in thought as her greyhound nuzzles her arm, she has dropped off her garment and seems spent from a long day of huntingSebatiano Ricci characteristically employed this graceful, elongated figure type and lively brushwork, but the mutedpalette, modest dimensions, and reflective tone are unusual for him. Perhaps he restrained his normally bold colors here because he depicted Diana at dusk. This painting shows his transition to a moreRococostyle ofpastelcolors and a lighter touch, leaving behind his earlier Baroque compositions with their dramatic gestures, bold colors, and serious subject matter.
Not long for this world, the Greek philosopher Seneca is helped into a bath by a female attendant. Having slit his wrists and consumed poison, Seneca struggles his way into the warm water intended to hasten his death. His limbs are limp and his mouth agape, but the philosopher is still able to complete his final thoughts, which two attentive scribes on either side of the scene dutifully record. In the rightbackground, two other observers await Seneca's final breath.Charged with conspiracy, Seneca chose to commit suicide rather than face the humiliation of execution. Thisnarrativeof theRoman Empirewas a popular subject in Italy in the 1700s and reflected the revival of interest in Stoicism. Stoic philosophers like Seneca argued for the control of the emotions; his suicide embodied this repression of feeling.Sebastiano Ricci's depiction of the pivotal moment in this episode likely served as a preparatory study for a painting. The small drawing displays Ricci's economical use of line and ability to compose a complex narrative in a clear and dramatic manner.
In Greek mythology, the heroPerseuswas famous for killingMedusa, the snake-hairedGorgonwhose grotesque appearance turned men to stone. This painting, however, shows a later episode from the hero's life. At Perseus's and Andromeda's wedding, their nuptials were interrupted by a mob led by Phineus, a disappointed suitor. After a fierce battle, Perseus finally triumphed by brandishing the head of Medusa and turning his opponents into stone.Sebastiano Ricci depicted the fight as a forceful, vigorous battle. In the center, Perseus lunges forward, his muscles taut as he shoves the head of Medusa at Phineus and his men. One man holds up a shield, trying to reflect the horrendous image and almost losing his balance. Behind him, soldiers already turned to stone are frozen in mid-attack. All around, other men have fallen and are dead or dying. Ricci used strong diagonals and active poses to suggest energetic movement.
Born from the sea, the mythological goddess Venus sits upon a throne pulled by muscular men and surrounded by her entourage. Her sonCupidflies nearby and grasps a handful of coral from a plate held by an attendant. Perched above Venus, a woman holds a string of pearls, a typical adornment of the goddess. The pearls fall through her hair and down along her shoulder.The composition is arranged in a loose pyramidal shape with Venus at the apex. Sebastiano Ricci used an array of flesh tones to describe and model the playful, graceful figures, from the reddish-brown tanned skin of the athletic men to the light brownish-peach skin of the cherub blowing a conch shell in the lower right-hand corner and the even lighter flesh of the women. Venus's softly painted skin is a creamy white with touches of pink in her cheeks, chest, stomach, and knees; her flesh glows as if lit from within. Against the blue sky, streaks of pink paint describe wispy clouds and fading sunlight.With theTriumph of the Marine Venus,Ricci made a transition from a moreclassicalBaroque style of dramatic gestures, bold colors, and serious subject matter to a more Rococo style of light, pastel colors, elegant, graceful figures, and decorative compositional elements.
In this fantastic vista, Marco Ricci combined ancient Roman monuments, such as an obelisk, sections of temples, and statues, to create a scene both picturesque and evocative of the power of the ancient world. In the last decade of his life, Ricci specialized in such theatrical views and repeatedly used the same monuments in different arrangements. As usual, his uncle Sebastiano Ricci painted the rustic figures, which are nearly lost amidst the colossal ruins.Joseph Smith, an English businessman and consul who lived in Venice for many years and became one of the greatest art patrons of his day, once owned this painting.
The Virgin, depicted both as a gentle, human mother and as an immortal, heavenly queen, cradles the Christ child in her arms. Andrea Briosco, called Riccio, made this sculpture while living in Padua, home to a thriving intellectual community and one of the most renowned universities in Europe. The study of ancient Greece and Rome was quite popular at the time, and Riccio combined a refined knowledge of antiquity with the Christian present, much to the delight of his contemporaries. The Virgin's dress and delicate features recall ancient Roman representations of deities. Shells, pearls, a winged putto, and a cameo decorate the crown atop her intricately arranged hair. Displaying the restless nature typical of small children, the infant Christ twists away from his mother to face the viewer.ThoughVirgin and Childwas originally a full-length statue, only the upper half now survives. Because the figures' heads are angled downward, scholars believe that Riccio made the sculpture as the devotional centerpiece of a raised altar. Now largely stripped of color,Virgin and Childwas once vibrantly painted. Originally, both figures had dark brown hair and pale skin. The Virgin wore a blue cloak over a red gown, while the Christ child wore a yellow garment. Scholars believe that traces of red on the Virgin's crown may be the remains of a preparatory ground for gold, suggesting that it was once gilded.
In this honest and direct self-portrait apparently made for its own sake, Jonathan Richardson the Elder used the blue paper that artists in Venice so often preferred. Drawing late in his life, Richardson focused on his face, with its firm mouth, dimpled chin, and pouchy eyes, rather than his clothing. The blue served as a middle tone, with the shadows and outlines drawn in black chalk and the gleaming tip of his nose, the edges of his lips, and his scarf highlighted in white. The smudgy, roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of deep shadows cast by the tilt of the turban, headgear popular with artistic types in the 1700s.
The front of this desk, known as asecrtaire,drops down to reveal an interior compartment divided into drawers, while the fall front itself becomes a writing surface. The entire body of interior fittings, made of solid mahogany, can be pulled out from the front, revealing secret lidded compartments below. Such shallow pieces of furniture that open or extend into larger objects were invented for the smaller, more intimate rooms of the later half of the 1700s.Although researchers cannot find the Getty Museum'ssecrtairelisted in the royal inventories, it is of the same caliber as other pieces made for Marie-Antoinette and the French court. Themountsare finelychasedin their smallest details, and the construction of the piece is of high quality.
Felix Mendelssohn, one of Germany's most gifted composers, died tragically at the age of thirty-eight. A year later, Ernst Friedrich August Rietschel made this memorialbustfor the Mendelssohn family. In imitation of ancient busts, Rietschel represented the sitter with bare shoulders, using an abrupt termination that cuts the shoulders in half and supporting the bust on a geometrical base similar to the capital of anIoniccolumn with a cartouche below. To leaven the formality of the bust's geometry, the artist carefully rendered thenaturalisticportrait elements--Mendelssohn's full, sensuous lips, the soft, deep-set eyes, the furrowed forehead, and curly crop of hair--to show Mendelssohn as his family and friends knew him. The marble bust conveys not only the composer's visual likeness but also his character: the high forehead suggests the composer's intellect, while the distant, penetrating gaze in his eyes speaks of his artistic vision. This evocative quality derives from the idea of an artist as a divinely inspired genius, a very popularRomanticconcept. Displayed in the family home, the bust commemorated Mendelssohn's contribution to the world of music and was a personal memento of the man for those who were intimate with him.
Louis XIV'scourt adored Hyacinthe Rigaud, who helped to formulate what a state portrait should be. While Rigaud made a credible likeness of the king, his purpose was not to express Louis's character but to glorify the monarchy. His originalPortrait of Louis XIVof 1701, now in theLouvre, was so popular that Rigaud had many copies made, both in full and half-length formats, often with the help of assistants.In this portrait from Rigaud's workshop, Louis XIV's ceremonial robes, elegant stance, and haughty expression proclaim his exalted status. Despite the vast expanses of canvas he covered, Rigaud remained concerned with the particular, describing the king's costume in great detail, even down to his shoe buckles.
His subjects' rank and social position interested Hyacinthe Rigaud more than each individual's character. In this drawing of a wealthy nobleman, Rigaud concentrated on the luxurious sheen of his satin coat, the delicate lace frothing around his throat and cuffs, and the damask lining of his cloak, which surrounds him like a cloud. Subtlehighlightseven pick up the gleam of the brass studs decorating the chair underneath his left hand. Rigaud achieved these effects by applying a layer of white gouache on top of the black chalk and gray wash, creating a gleaming, three-dimensional effect. In contrast, the man's face and luxuriant flowing wig appear flat and static.Textiles, used for either home furnishings or dress, were important indicators of an individual's social rank in the 1700s. In an age when only the wealthiest members of society could afford such expensive and fragile fabrics as silk, satin, and damask, both quality and quantity mattered. Only wealthy individuals could wear lace in the early 1700s, and fashion strictly controlled the style and the amount that was shown. The abundance of fabulous cloth in this drawing is therefore a silent indicator of this man's wealth and importance.
TheArchbishopof Cambrai, Charles de Saint-Albin, was the illegitimate son of Philippe,duc d'Orlans, and a dancer at the opera. Although his father never recognized him officially, he smoothed his son's swift advance in the Church hierarchy and aided his appointment to the archbishopric of Cambrai. In the year of his appointment, the archbishop commissioned this portrait from Hyacinthe Rigaud, the most accomplished and flattering portraitist at the court ofLouis XIV.Shown in his robes of office, Saint-Albin balances a book on his knee and presses his left hand to his chest, a gesture suggesting his spirituality. Rigaud masterfully displayed the different textures of his shimmering satin robe and the exquisitely patterned lace of the garment worn underneath. A soft ermine cape is painted so realistically that the viewer can see the indentations left by Saint-Albin's fingers as they press against the fur.
Originally forming part of a page from a choir book, this illuminatedAwas the first letter of a long and elaborate chant sung on Easter Sunday. The text of the chant describes the scene at Jesus' tomb on Easter morning. The angel of the Lord spoke to the women saying,  Whom do you seek  Do you seek Jesus  He is already risen. Come and see.  In the initial, the angel perched atop the empty sarcophagus gestures aloft to indicate that Jesus has risen from the dead. A second initial depicting the resurrected Christ may have been taken from the same book.The dazzling gold diffused throughout the scene and the reflective lemon yellow of the rock both enhance the spiritual intensity of the image. Such vibrant colors were hallmarks of Bartolomeo Rigossi's style.
The women's upturned, grasping palms beautifully convey their adoration of Christ, tenderly answered by Christ's gesture. Bartolomeo Rigossi used a brilliant yellow to describe the wispy grass and foliage as well as to create the warm light cascading over the rolling hills. This expressive narrative and these creative effects of light and color reveal his inventiveness.TheN, removed from a choir book at some point in the past, was the first letter of a chant sung during the Easter season. The scene is a variation of an episode described in the Gospel of John: Mary Magdalene, distressed at finding Christ's tomb empty, at first mistook the risen Christ for a gardener. Here the handle of a gardener's spade also serves as the staff of the banner of the Resurrection.Another historiated initial by Rigossi depicting the women at the tomb may have been taken from the same choir book.
While meditating on the Crucified Christ on Mount La Verna in Umbria, Saint Francis of Assisi became so enflamed with love and devotion that his body was transformed into the likeness of Christ. Enfolded in the wings of an angel, the Crucified Christ appeared to the saint, and his wounds (stigmata) appeared on Francis's body.In this miniature, the craggy mountain is depicted as a series of slate-colored parallel planes. From the crevices of the mountain emerge stylized trees. At the lower right, the artist has shown a number of birds in order to recall the famous story of Saint Francis preaching to the birds. This leaf comes from a gradual, the choir book that contained all of the sung portions of the mass, where it introduced the text and music for the Feast of Saint Francis.
At a table beside an open window, two men sit for their portrait. Stacked books, a vase, and a globe line the shelf above their heads, while an hourglass sits on the windowsill. Scholars know nothing about Hans Furraht on the left or Jacob von der Burch on the right, apart from their names, which are inscribed by their heads. Both wear the costumes of fashionable, middle-class burghers, with tight-fitting padded jackets and a soft, low bonnet on their heads for warmth. Hans, shown measuring a skull, may have been a doctor or anatomist; he wears somber clothing decorated only with a ruff around his neck. Jacob, who studies a stereometric form, was probably a mathematician and wears a more ornate checkered jacket with slashed sleeves.German artists in the 1500s frequently added small clues to suggest greater symbolism in their works. The skull together with the hourglass on the window ledge may suggestvanitas.The difference between the man on the left, who addresses the viewer with his gaze, and the one on the right, lost in study of the object he holds, may contrast the active and contemplative life.
This monumental bronze vase was first exhibited at theExposition Universelle(world's fair) in Paris in 1889. Its surfaces teem with applied life casts of spiders, a juniper branch, peacock feathers, lace, ribbons, and snails. This fantastical imagery is reminiscent of the art of contemporary Symbolist artists, who were preoccupied by visionary themes. Its scale is also consistent with other virtuoso works of art during the last decades of the 1800s. Yet its overall form, and twisted, fluted handles are directly based on an ancient Roman volute krater (mixing vessel) from Pompeii that the sculptor drew during a visit to the archaeological museum in Naples in 1877.
This long cabinet is actually made up of three separate cabinets placed end to end and fixed together with bolts. The original purpose of this unique object is not clear. Since the interior contains shelves that can be adjusted to varying heights, the joined cabinets may have been used to store boxes of prints, drawings, or maps. Three long drawers with separate locks, possibly used for storing larger sheets, run along the base.
Lacquerfrom China and Japan had been imported into France since the 1600s because its decorative patterns and exotic character immediately appealed to wealthy consumers. In the 1700s increasing quantities of cabinets, screens, trays, and other shapes reached Europe and were adapted for use in Western interiors. By the 1730s it became fashionable to cut and apply the lacquer panels to new forms as a type of decorativeveneer.On this commode, the central oval panel of lacquer on the front was cut from the doors of a Japanese cabinet. The rest of the surface was painted in imitation of lacquer in a technique known asvernis Martin,after the Martin brothers, who invented the most successful and widely used imitation lacquer in the 1700s.In 1737 the royal inventories recorded that thebnisteBernard van Risenburgh delivered a commode applied with lacquer panels toLouis XV'swife, Marie Leczinska. That delivery date helps scholars to date this similarly decorated commode.
Eighteenth-century craftsmen frequently dismantled objects from China and Japan and adapted them for use in European interiors.bnistesfound ingenious solutions to adapt the valuable lacquer into new forms. The doors of a Japanese cabinet furnished the lacquer panels for these corner cupboards. The wide, central gilt-bronze mount cleverly hides the join between the two lacquer doors, and the meandering mounts frame the panels' outer edges.Themarchands-merciers(dealers) purchased lacquer objects and directed thebnistes,who transformed them into new works appealing to wealthy French connoisseurs. The quest for lacquer was not an easy one. In 1745 one dealer wrote in a sale catalogue that  choice pieces are extremely hard to find, especially old ones. They sometimes fetch surprising prices, even in Holland.  Holland was the best place to buy lacquer, since the Dutch East India Company had a monopoly on trade with Japan, where the lacquer was produced.
This piece of mid-eighteenth-century furniture was meant to be used like a modern filing cabinet: papers were placed in leather-fronted cardboard boxes (now missing) that were fitted into the open shelves. A large table decorated in the same manner would have been placed in front for working with those papers. Access to thecartonnier's lower half can only be gained by the doors at the sides, because the table would have blocked the front.The painted black-and-gold decoration is commonly known asvernis Martin,named after the Martin brothers, Parisians who excelled at the craft of imitating Japaneselacquer. Their workshop probably also supplied the bronze Chinese figures flanking and surmounting above the clock.
Natural objects such as shells, corals, small stuffed animals, and minerals were probably displayed in these cabinets. The owner could pull out a shelf set beneath the upper doors to rearrange and examine his or her specimens. Many wealthy Europeans maintained such collections in rooms known as curiosity cabinets, where they spent much time in avid study of natural marvels, both before and during theAge of Enlightenment.The wire mesh screens in the upper doors are modern replacements for earlier screens. Eighteenth-century artisans commonly used screens of gilded or plain wire in place of glass on cabinets for displaying books or natural history specimens.
The double form of this unusually large desk is unique. When lowered, both sides form writing surfaces and reveal drawers and pigeonholes veneered with marquetry. The finely cast andchasedgilt-bronzemountsdelineate the edges of the drawers, front, and legs. On the fall fronts of the desk, bunches of marquetry flowers seem to sprout from the sculptural mounts.The desk was probably made for thefermier gnral(a type of tax collector) Franois-Balthazar Dang; a similar desk is described in an inventory taken at his death in 1777. The desk is also found in the 1795 inventory of his son Louis, who was guillotined during theFrench Revolution.
The pair of commodes is part of a set with three larger commodes and a pair of corner cupboards that were probably made for the German hunting castle Schloss Moritzburg. Gilt bronzemountsof a stag attacked by dogs decorate the fronts of this pair; guns, quivers for arrows, and hunting horns overlay the corner mounts. These elements symbolize the hunt, one of the most important pastimes of the nobility in the 1700s, when stag hunting was considered the highest art of the sport.The commodes are both stampedBVRBand were made by Bernard van Risenburgh. They are not typical of his work, perhaps because they were made not for a French client but for a German one,Frederick Augustus II, theElectorof Saxony. The bold and massive design of these mounts is not found on other works by van Riesenburgh, and they may have been made by a German bronze caster. Van Risenburgh was an extremely versatile cabinetmaker, able to adapt the subtle French style to suit the taste of different cultures and patrons.
Model Tony Ward, a longtime collaborator and muse of photographer Herb Ritts, looks squarely at the camera, formidable muscles flexed, with the calm poise of a quasi-mythical hero. Were it not for a deep tan, the buttons on his shirt, and the modern tailoring of his immaculate white slacks, he would resemble an ancient Greek sculpture. Even the cling of his shirt echoes classical  wet drapery. Ritts often used bright sunlight for dramatic effect, and here combines it with a fiercely simple backdrop and composition. The patterns of the thin shirt over the sculpted torso and arms provide the main decorative interest in an image of otherwise stark purity.
For California native son Herb Ritts, the beach in Malibu was a favorite location for both his art and commercial photography, as in this image created for an advertising campaign.One of his longtime collaborators, model Cindy Crawford, whisks up the hem of her voluminous skirt to showcase not only the elegant couture gown, but an insouciant spirit too. She later recalled how Ritts often favored this pose--of arms cocked to the sides and one leg hidden--to create strong graphic lines.  The resulting image projects his characteristic sophistication and whimsy.
Francisco Rizi made this complete decorative and architectural design for a cupola, a small dome of a church. The central compartment depicts the Virgin Mary and Christ seated amid clouds and framed on four sides by pairs of putti supporting balustrades. In the lower right corner, Rizi drew a prophet. Rizi was Madrid's major practitioner of illusionistic architectural painting, orquadratura,which Italian artists had introduced earlier in the 1600s. The building for which this design was intended is not known.
In the crumbling remains of a Roman temple, a monk prays at the foot of an altar. Absorbed in his devotions, he is unaware of three young women sneaking inside to steal flowers from a makeshift shrine. Above this trio, a woman on a ladder leans over a low wall and, with a long branch, taunts the praying hermit.Placed on the stone altar are a crucifix, books, an open Bible, an hourglass, a skull, and a rosary. The skull and hourglass, common symbols of the temporality of man and his creations, suggest that the building itself represents fallen greatness. Hubert Robert emphasizes the ruins' immensity by contrasting the small figures with the structure's massive columns. In the left foreground, a column shrouded in darkness runs nearly the full height of the composition. Birds roosting in the upper reaches of the lofty barrel vault reinforce the impression of the monument's vast dimensions.This small cabinet picture is one of several versions of the subject depicted by Robert beginning in the 1760s. In each of them, a monk prays beside a brick wall that has been built within the arcades of a Roman ruin. For this imaginary basilica, Robert likely drew inspiration from a contemporary print by Giovanni Battista Piranesi.
Natural, spontaneous, and fresh, this drawing reflects French artists' new direct approach to nature in the second half of the 1700s. The director of the French Academy in Rome encouraged students to make the Italian capital and its environs one of their favored subjects.Hubert Robert created this drawing while a student at that academy. It explicitly embodies a theme that remained constant throughout his career: the interaction between living nature and aged, slightly decaying buildings. He brought many such drawings back to Paris, where they served as sources for his paintings for many years.Robert typically developedcompositionswhose effect was both picturesque and slightly imposing. This scene, drawn in red chalk, one of his favorite media, combines direct observation with the artist's imagination. Characteristically, Robert included two diminutive figures at the stone well; they serve to accentuate the lean-to's great height and the massiveness of the well's pulley.
An artist sits drawing in an ancient sculpture gallery. Light streams in from the left, where the gallery is open to a courtyard. During the eighteenth century young artists flocked to Rome from all over Europe to study the monuments of antiquity and the Renaissance.This red chalk drawing depicts the Capitoline Museum, a gallery of ancient sculpture which opened in Rome in 1734 and quickly became ade factoclassroom for aspiring artists. The figure of the draftsman is likely Robert himself. His choice to place the draftsman surrounded by monumental sculptures, creates a sense of the overwhelming effect of the ancients on eighteenth-century artists.
Small figures of peasants and their animals happily prepare their washing, rest, or fish around the large columns of a ruined Roman temple, which serves as the focus and setting of this drawing. A bulky tree opposite the temple balances thecomposition, reaching up to the sky with its picturesque, crooked branches.Hubert Robert was the first artist to make ancient ruins the main focus of his landscapes rather than placing them in thebackgroundas picturesque accessories. He made many such drawings during his time in Italy and then used them as the basis for the paintings he made later in France. This scene may represent a specific temple that Robert visited in Rome and knew from engravings.
Under a bright, sun-drenched sky, the demolition of the chteau of Meudon is well under way. In the lower left, a man in a top hat directs four laborers--one clearly shirking his responsibilities. Other workmen transport stones with wheelbarrows or by hand. At center, two women and a young girl admire the ruins. Other visitors have entered the structure and gaze out from a balcony. Another young woman, holding a baby, tends to a group of children playfully lugging a cart across the littered courtyard. At the right edge, an artist with a large sheet of paper on his lap, gestures at the scene below.This diverse human activity--encompassing work, rest, and play--is dwarfed by the chteau itself, which although partly demolished, creates a strong diagonal axis through the composition. Hubert Robert also emphasizes the main structure by casting it in strong light. By contrast, many of the figures around the periphery of the composition are shrouded in shadow.Located near Versailles, with a view of Paris and the Seine River, the chteau of Meudon was once among France's finest monuments. But during the 1700s, it fell into disrepair. During the French Revolution, which began in 1789, the chteau was ransacked and it suffered further damage in a fire of 1795. It was demolished entirely in 1803. Rather than documenting the site's actual appearance in that year, Hubert Robert combined fact and fiction, depicting features that had already vanished alongside still-existing elements of the structure.
In search of the  genuine peasant  type for this genre scene of domestic rural life, Henry Peach Robinson described how he first envisioned this image:One of the best models I ever employed was an old man of seventy-four. He was a crossing-sweeper. I should never have accomplished one of my best works if I had not seen him sitting at a table in my studio, waiting, till I could talk to him. I not only saw the old man there, but mentally, the old lady, and the interior of the cottage...The old man, by his attitude and expression, gave the germ of the idea; the old lady had to be found, and the cottage built, but they appeared to me then quite visibly and solidly.When Day's Work is Doneexists in more copies than any other photograph by Robinson. The photograph is acombination printmade from six different negatives, a significant technical accomplishment. The negatives were attached in pairs to a sheet of glass for support, and the final image was made in three printings of those pairs.The line between the light-colored wall behind the woman and the dark shadows of the room, a stage set built for the photograph, reveals one of the seams between negatives. This deceptively simple domestic scene required a complicated printing process to accommodate its range of illumination, from the darkforegroundto the bright outdoors seen through the window.
While contemplating the crucifix, Mary Magdalene clasps her hands in prayer and devoutly kneels with her eyes raised towards the heavens. The agitated drapery of her gown and the white light streaming into her tear-filled eyes convey a deeply emotional and spiritual scene. A vision of angels appears in the sky, andputtisitting beside her hold objects often associated with the penitent Magdalene.The putto in front, as teary-eyed as the saint, raises a whip in remembrance of Christ's flagellation. In his right hand he holds a skull, reminding the viewer of the inevitable transience of life on earth. The putto in thebackgroundholds the vase of ointment that Mary Magdalene used to anoint Christ's feet. The open book in his other hand represents her contemplative nature, connoting her ultimate regret for her earlier sins. The luminous colors andpainterlyhandling in this small cabinet picture contribute to the pervading mood of spiritual ecstasy.
Marie-Antoinette sat in this chair while her servants arranged her hair and applied her makeup in her bedroom at the Petit Trianon a small house built on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. Known as achaise de toilette, its swivel mechanism and low back were specially designed for performing the daily rituals of dressing. It is finely carved with bands of lily of the valley and ivy along the curved supports of the arms, while the legs and edge of the circular seat imitate caning.The Petit Trianon was given to the queen by her husband, Louis XVI, as a private retreat where she could escape from the rigid etiquette of court life. Marie-Antoinette furnished these intimate apartments, which were never seen by most of the courtiers, with exquisite furniture that reflected her own personal taste.This chair was part of a set of furniture delivered to the palace in 1787 that also included two armchairs, two side chairs, a fire screen, and a stool. The bed from the set is missing, but the rest remains at the Petit Trianon. The other pieces retain the original pastel-colored paint in yellow, blue, green, and white that has unfortunately been stripped from this chair.
In ancient mythology, the sphinx embodies an amalgam of human, lion, and hawk body parts. The subject of this watercolor by Auguste Rodin, titled Sphinx, doesn't literally represent such a beast. Instead, the artist drew a young woman, who is standing frontally, with her arms folded.Rodin made this drawing late in his life, during a period of prodigious output. As is common in those drawings, sketchy pentimento lines appear to suggest a figure in motion. Here, though, the scribbly pencil marks may indicate that the model was partially clothed, because of the artist's inscription,  noir draperie  (black drapery).Rodin usually sketched his models without taking his eyes off the figure or looking down at the sheet of paper. In this case, the artist first incised the figure's silhouette--notably the hips and elbows--before using the pencil or the brush. Although the figure appears hastily sketched, the drawing as a whole reflects Rodin's considerable abilities as a draftsman. Details, such as the model's perfectly turned right ankle and knee, belie his considerable skills of observation. Carefully applied watercolor washes reveal Rodin's mastery of technique.Like many nineteenth-century artists, Rodin was interested in exotic subjects. Subtle clues, such as sand beneath the woman's feet and a palm tree on the horizon imply that, like the Great Sphinx of Giza, this woman is set in a time-forgotten, romanticized place. Rodin's title implies on a metaphorical level that she--or  woman  more generally--is like the sphinx, an enigmatic creature.
When closed, this stand appears to be in the form of a table, yet it extends and opens in a complex manner to serve several functions. The height and angle of the upper section can be raised or lowered to form a reading stand, while narrow drawers pop open from the sides. The lower section has two hinged compartments, each containing eight small drawers.The stand is covered with a pattern ofgeometricparquetryand inlaid with ivory and mother-of pearl. In the center of the writing surface is the coat-of-arms ofJohann Philipp von Walderdorff,ElectorandArchbishopof Trier. Walderdorff filled his palace with elegant furniture, commissioning more than twenty pieces from the maker of this stand, Abraham Roentgen.
Made in theNeoclassicalstyle, this monumental rolltop desk is fitted with numerous complicated mechanical devices, the specialty of David Roentgen's workshop. When the writing surface is pulled out, a mechanism automatically withdraws the solid rolltop back into the carcass, displaying the drawers and pigeon holes inside the desk. Behind the large gilt bronze plaque in the middle of the top is a contraption of many parts that moves out and opens at the turn of a key. It contains a folding reading and writing stand with compartments that hold an inkwell and sand pot for use by a person standing at the closed desk.
This clock was one of the most popular models produced by the German workshop run by David Roentgen and Peter Kinzing. The case is covered with a simple maple veneer, while gilt bronzemountssymbolizing Time add decoration around the clock face: Chronos (Father Time) supports the clock dial, and the passage of the year is marked by the garland over the dial, with its flowers for spring, wheat for summer, grapes for autumn, and holly leaves for winter. The faces of day and night are shown around thefrieze, and the whole is crowned with a lyre, symbol of the sun godApollowho oversees the passage of Time. Although the clock once played a tune when it chimed, this movement no longer works.Several other existing clocks include a large gilt bronze statue of Apollo playing his lyre on the top; as there are holes on the top of the case, such a figure probably once adorned this clock too.Johann Wilhelm Weyl created the musical mechanism for this clock.
Roasted and peeled chestnuts were a particular delicacy in the 1700s, served as a dessert with a coating of icing in bowls such as this pair. Factories generally sold the bowls singly, though they also came in pairs as part of a dinner or dessert service.The Svresporcelainmanufactory's stock books list several different designs for chestnut bowls. For bowls with pierced decoration, such as this pair, customers would have to pay nearly twice as much as for less intricate examples. It took all the skills of the kiln manager to prevent the sides from separating or sagging each time the piece was fired. He would have fired this pair three times, once for the porcelain body and the ground color, once for the enameled colors, and once for thegilding.
In this peaceful scene set in the Dutch countryside, a canal runs alongside a tall, thin castle. By the 1640s, when Roelant Roghman drew it, this former military building had been converted into a luxurious country house. Signs of its military past are visible in the crenellated roofline, with alternating open spaces from which armed guards could defend the castle and shield themselves.This drawing is typical of Roghman's style in that the primary focus is the castle's architectural presence, while the landscape is secondary. The castle has a monumental quality; its chimney decorations rise to the top of the page. Sharp diagonal lines radiate from the tops of the upper-floor windows, suggesting decorative brick archways above each. Also, the drawing's sharpest details are found in the man-made structures--the castle doorway and the bridge--while the trees nearby and in the distant grove at right appear almost blurred.
This was in Appalachia and the conditions there were extremely bad. You just had to look at some of these individuals, especially the children. There weren't many miners in those particular areas-the big mines had closed up. If we saw a group perhaps sitting on a porch or the kids wandering around, I would ask them if I could take their picture.-Milton RogovinOver a period of nine years, Milton Rogovin and his wife Anne traveled to Appalachia each summer for working vacations. They visited and documented mining towns and communities. During the 1960s, Appalachia became the focus of international attention for its economic difficulties and the efforts of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to bring relief. Simultaneously, information came to light about the mines' working conditions, from underground fires and explosions to black-lung disease. The Rogovins were well aware of these issues and decided to investigate for themselves.It is easy to notice what is most important to this home's occupants. A few possessions are lovingly arranged: twin frames with portraits of Jesus and Mary, a child's drawing of a bunny, a hinged frame with a woman's portrait and a picture of Jesus. On the table sit a white crocheted tablecloth, a can of tobacco, a Bible, and a record player. A little boy-presumably the son of a former coal miner-sits gazing at the camera with a wistful and wary stare.
Milton Rogovin photographed inhabitants of the Lower West Side district of Buffalo, New York, over a period of twenty years. The process allowed the photographer and the viewer to witness the development of several families. In thistriptych, Rogovin illustrated the evolution of one family. In the first frame, Eva appears as a single mother, not far removed from childhood herself. Mother and daughter, both heavily bundled against the cold, stand on the grimy, littered sidewalk, suggesting, perhaps, that on this first encounter the photographer was not invited into the private space of their home.The second photograph shows Eva and her daughter standing in front of the television set at home, surrounded by familial and religious images. Their age difference seems so small that they could be mistaken for sisters. The final photograph, made nineteen years after the first, portrays Eva as a grandmother and her daughter as a mother of three. Their surroundings are now considerably richer with personal effects, connoting a more comfortable and secure home life.
Once you've studied the pictures for a while, they begin to speak. The people in the pictures hold still . . . They tell you their life-stories.In this sequence of images, Milton Rogovin depicts the development of a family, as the same boy grows from infancy to adulthood. First, proud grandparents hold the infant on the day of his baptism in 1974. Then, at eleven years old, the boy is shown in a suit and tie beside his grandmother. The boy's grandfather is not included in this image, which immediately provokes questions as to his whereabouts. The likely cause of his absence can only be his death. Finally, the boy is shown as a strong young man of eighteen, towering over his small grandmother who leans on a dresser for support.Rogovin has spent two decades photographing families in his neighborhood of Buffalo, New York. As a member of the community, he is trusted to represent faithfully and sensitively the lives of his subjects. His portraits are consistently presented as sets of three pictures showing the changes that families undergo over time.
We went to Alabama. There, I came across this African-American miner. He was just sitting there and resting. I took his picture and asked if I could go to his home. If you'll notice, the husband and wife are standing in front of the Last Supper tapestry. I wrote a little poem that ended up saying,  I wonder how many times did the wife wonder if this would be his last supper  -Milton RogovinIn the late 1960s, Appalachian coal miners became symbols of economic adversity. After numerous summers spent in Appalachia documenting the plight of mine workers there, Milton Rogovin decided to return almost two decades later to expand his series.This middle-aged miner in dirty overalls, a light flannel jacket, and a patched-up hardhat is probably either taking his lunch break or getting ready to go home. He is seated on a bench next to his lunchbox and with a friendly but rather neutral expression he faces the camera with a pair of glasses in his sooty hands.In the diptych's second photograph, the man appears markedly different. Clean and dressed up, he and his wife hold hands as they face the camera. Behind them on a paneled wall hangs a tapestry reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's paintingThe Last Supper-an element adding meaning in relation to the miner's hazardous occupation.
Everything that I did, like photography, was always to show those who I call  the forgotten ones,  the people who are poor. The most convincing thing I could do is just to show them as they are. If you see the way they look, the way they stand, what's in the background, you can decide for yourself.-Milton RogovinMilton Rogovin's signature approach to his subjects was that he never posed them. He simply asked them if he could take their pictures-both in their workplaces and at home.Here, workers dressed in dirty jeans and white shirts stand at the entrance of the mine where they work. Rogovin focused on a young man with glistening skin, which shows beneath his open shirt. The man gazes pleasantly toward the camera, in contrast to his coworkers who seem rather tentative about being photographed.In Rogovin's accompanying portrait of the worker at home, everyone looks relaxed. The man wears a similar expression, but smiles. He stands with one arm wrapped around his tall wife, and in the other, holds their child. Dark palm leaves and a painting of a tropical scene hint at where they live: Cuba. In the 1980s, Rogovin decided to portray an international community of coal miners. He traveled to mining areas around the world, including this one in Moa Bay near Guantnamo.
Milton Rogovin photographed inhabitants of the Lower West Side district of Buffalo, New York, over a period of twenty years. The elapsed time allows the viewer to witness the development of several families.     Michael and Pam were first photographed on the street standing before a graffiti-marked wall. Defiant and proud in his Afro and turtleneck and protectively clutching Pam, Michael epitomizes the image of male bravado fashionable in the early 1970s. Eleven years later, both Michael and Pam had become sweetly domesticated, seen in a cozy interior with a babe in arms. The final image of the family shows a distinguished couple and their three children, surrounded by the accumulation of family photographs on the mantel and wall. Through the dramatic passage of time, Rogovin illustrated the stages of a complex family life.
Milton Rogovin photographed inhabitants of the Lower West Side district of Buffalo, New York, over a period of twenty years. The elapsed time allows the viewer to witness the development of several families.     In the first photograph, Hector and Sugar stand close together against an outside brick wall, framed by basement windows. Head cocked to the side, he looks cocky and defiant. In contrast, she looks uncomfortable as she stands rigidly upright. Eleven years later, the intimacy of the two had blossomed into a brood of nine grouped on the stairs and porch of the family's home. Baby strollers abound in the weeds like ersatz flowers. In the most recent image, grandchildren appear, though not all family members from the previous photograph are present. Most notably Hector is absent, provoking curiosity about the turn of events that has reconfigured this family group.
In Franz Roh's photograph of railroad tracks, the rails disappear into the darkness of night. To convey an eerie feeling, he printed the image as a negative. The picture resonates with the same aura of mystery that many people attribute to riding in small, dark, confined railway cars--excellent settings for cinematic suspense and intrigue. Roh, however, was less interested in the mysterious nature of the journey than he was in the graphic nature of the intersecting rails.
Brightly colored leaves and delicate vines surround the text on this highly decorated calendar page for the month of June. To the right, a man leans on his scythe to take a break from his arduous task of mowing, a labor specifically associated with this summer month. The golden crustacean floating in the sky above him is a representation of the zodiacal sign of Cancer.
A gracefully posed young woman gestures towards a portraitbustthat stands in the center of a large pedestal. Two children attempt to clamber up the pedestal while a dog rests in the back on the base. Around the pedestal, the attributes of an architect--T-square, compass, globe, books, and drawings--are casually placed, composing a still life.While the bust may be a portrait of an unidentified architect, the other figures areallegorical. The dog is a traditional symbol of fidelity, while the two children are symbols of their potential for instruction, referring to the moral, ethical, and utopian roles given to architects in this period.Although the use of allegory recalls tomb monuments, the piece speaks in a celebratory mode, honoring the architect with theclassicizingvocabulary of the bust form and an elevated base adorned with garlands and fretwork molding. Similarly, rather than suggesting a mournful tone, the figures' poses suggest familial intimacy, particularly the young woman's informal leaning posture and her arm around the back of the bust.The work was made in several pieces that were joined together before firing. Except for the woman's head, which is hollow, each of the figures is made of solid clay.
In a richly brocaded robe, with rosy cheeks, shining eyes, and outstretched arms, Saint Gins de la Jara appeals to the faithful standing before him. His gestures and open mouth suggest that he is preaching. According to legend, after Saint Gins was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and tossed it into the Rhne River. Carried by the sea to the coast of southeastern Spain, it was retrieved and conserved as arelic. Life-sized, devotional cult objects often included glass eyes and were often made out of wood that could be painted in order to achieve lifelike results. Reinforcing the emotional experience of the faithful, such heightenedrealismtypified SpanishBaroqueart at a time when the Catholic Church sought to makeChristianitymore accessible to believers.Luisa Roldn, also called La Roldana, carved the work. The figure waspolychromedby her brother-in-law, Toms de los Arcos, who used the Spanish technique ofestofadoto replicate the brocadedecclesiasticalgarments. In this process, the area of the figure's garment was first covered ingold leafand painted over with brown paint, and then incised with a stylus to reveal the gold underneath.
To test Abraham's faith, God ordered him to sacrifice his only child Isaac. Abraham bound Isaac, laid him on the altar, and drew his knife to kill him. At that moment, an angel appeared and held back Abraham's hand, saying,  Now I know you are a God-fearing man, as you have not withheld your only son from me.  Giulio Romano captured the scene's drama through the energetic swoop of the angel that hovers over Abraham's head. Abraham peers up astonished, while Isaac cowers on the stone altar. The figures all have squat, stocky proportions, broad faces, and hair and beards composed of solid, horn-like locks and curls. Some scholars speculate that Raphael, Giulio's master, may have begun the drawing, allowing his student to finish it. The drawing was probably made in preparation for a print. The artist used a stylus to outline the scene at first, then fleshed out the composition more fully in red chalk. An existing engraving corresponds in size and detail to this work.
Giulio Romano set Christ and John the Baptist's first meeting on the day of the traditional Jewish purification ceremony, forty days after John the Baptist's birthday. The meaning of this enigmatic painting is unclear, and it has been known by several titles. At right a woman carries a basket with two turtledoves, the required offering of the poor. After the purification ceremony, at which the priest recognized Christ's destiny, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus visited her cousin Elizabeth and John the Baptist, Elizabeth's son. Precociously, Jesus opens a book, showing that his birth signaled the debut of a new era. The scroll, one of the Baptist's attributes, readsEcce Agnus Dei(Behold the lamb of God).As Raphael's most important protg, Giulio adapted Raphael's late style in the darkly evocative landscape and these tightly interlocked figures and idealized female faces. Features typical of Giulio's work include the metallic palette, muscular figures with heavy features, and lively details such as the dog dashing out the doorway at left and theall'anticalandscape at right.
Seated on the edge of a cloud, in the center of the bottom of this drawing, a personification of the city of Mantua reaches out to receive a book from another figure at the right. Others circle above her holding in their hands such attributes as a globe, a lute, and a wreath. The god Mercury, identifiable by his winged helmet, hovers in the upper right corner.Giulio Romano produced this design as a study for his patron Federico II Gonzaga's Palazzo del T, outside of Mantua. Intended to glorify Federico and his reign, it presents the central ceiling fresco of an addition to the palazzo. The numerous pentimenti in the drawing show that Giulio continued to experiment with the arrangement of the figures. For example, the right arm of the woman with a wreath was originally extended, holding a book. The figure on the far left, whose left arm reaches towards the center, was originally drawn slightly higher.
In a canvas filled with half-naked, twisting bodies, the story of Bacchus's birth unfolds in a typically wry Mannerist comment on the perils of passion. On discovering that the chief god Jupiter had impregnated the young mortal Semele, his wife Juno hatched a plan to end their love affair. Disguised as Semele's nurse, and knowing that Jupiter's lightning and thunder were lethal, she persuaded Semele to ask Jupiter to visit  in all his glory.  Here, as Semele gives birth to Bacchus, who is caught by nymphs, as she herself is consumed by flames. From the top of the clouds, Juno looks apprehensively at her thunderbolt-carrying husband.Giulio Romano and his workshop originally painted this scene as part of an erotic series of mythological love stories for Federico Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. Giulio probably did not execute the series by himself, though he probably designed them and painted selected parts.
Two Roman gods and a goddess, accompanied by a Victory, peer down from the edge of a bank of clouds. On the left, holding a large key, is Janus, the guardian of the doorways of houses and city gates. He is traditionally portrayed with two faces, demonstrating his ability to look both ways at once. In the center, the bearded figure of Chronos personifies Time. In one hand he holds a scythe, while a snake gripping its tail in its mouth wraps itself around his neck. Such a snake holding its tail was an ancient Egyptian symbol of eternity. Gaea, the goddess of the Earth, crouches at Chronos's feet with another snake grasped in her right hand. The winged figure of Victory, her hair streaming out to the side, stands behind these three and holds out a crown in her left hand.Giulio Romano made this drawing in preparation for part of the frescoed vault of the Sala dei Giganti (Room of the Giants) in the Palazzo del Te, the summer residence of the court of Giulio's patron, Federico Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. Giulio completed the preparatory drawings for the fresco, and his assistants then squared them for transfer to the ceiling.
While the winds belch fire, Jupiter opens the mortal womb of his lover Semele with a thunderbolt and snatches forth the baby god Bacchus. His love for Semele had enraged his wife the goddess Juno, who swore to destroy her. Disguised as Semele's old nurse, Juno tricked Semele into asking Jupiter to come to her in all his splendor. Thus Jupiter's godly presence set Semele's frail human body on fire. After Giulio Romano completed this preparatory drawing, it was squared so that his assistants could copy it onto another surface. Inventories show that Giulio made a painting with a similar subject for the ducal palace in Mantua to celebrate the birth of a  Gonzaga prince in 1533, the son of Giulio's patron Federico Gonzaga. He may have made this drawing as a study for another painting of the same subject, now in the Getty Museum.
The muscular Greek god Hercules leans back to rest after completing the second of his twelve labors. King Eurystheus had ordered him to kill the monstrous, seven-headed hydra, a water-snake that ravaged the countryside. As soon as the hero cut off one head, however, two more appeared in its place. With the help of a companion, Hercules finally killed the creature by cauterizing the necks with a burning torch. Giulio Romano showed Hercules resting triumphant, with the hydra heads strewn around his feet. He holds his club under one arm and grasps the end of a torch in the other, while his bow and quiver of arrows hang from the tree behind.This drawing does not relate to any known work. Some scholars have suggested that Guilio may have used it as a preparatory study for a print, while others believe he may have made it for a painting project commissioned by his patron, Ercole d'Este. The soldier Ercole was often associated with his namesake Hercules, the personification of strength and courage.
This wall clock design with an ornate gilt bronze case and bracket was popular in France; artisans produced such examples for nearly twenty years through the 1740s and 1750s. In the corner of the Getty Museum's pastel painting by Maurice-Quentin de la Tour from around 1740 sits a similar model in the form of a clock, on top of a cabinet. The Getty Museum's example can be dated to about 1758 because one of the movement's springs is inscribed with this date.Scholars believe that Charles Cressent, one of the greatestbnistesof the 1700s, designed the elaborate gilt bronze and enameled metal case of this clock. Stringent guild regulations prohibited Cressent from gilding and chasing this design himself as he was a cabinetmaker and not a member of the bronze caster's guild. However, by veneering the wooden sides of this clock with metal and then attaching the gilt bronze mounts on top, he could successfully avoid prosecution.
Cristoforo Roncalli's comprehensive understanding of the human form is evident in this sensuous drawing of an angel, whose idealized grace and beauty convey his divine status even more powerfully than his wings do. Striding across a cloud and holding an open book, the figure looks upward as if receiving a sacred message. Swirling strokes defining his tousled hair contrast with the parallel lines used to shade the wings. The figure's expressive movement and gesture, captured in a characteristic Mannerist contrapposto pose, effectively convey an unearthly power.Though the drawing is not associated with any known painting, scholars believe it was made as a preparatory study for a larger project. Three studies of a male nude falling on his back, drawn on the verso of the sheet, provide a clue about this possible undertaking. The verso studies show how Roncalli worked out his composition forThe Conversion of St. Paul, a fresco he executed at a chapel in Rome in 1586. It is possible that the angel was drawn for the same chapel; however, large sections of the painting are now missing due to damage and deterioration. Both the angel and the studies of the falling figure show Roncalli's extraordinary ability to capture the unrestrained rhythm and energy of the body.
AfterJoseph of Arimatheaobtained permission fromPontius Pilate, he andNicodemustook Christ's body down from the cross and swathed it in strips of linen cloth, with myrrh and aloes to preserve the body. One of the two men kneels on the right, while theVirgin MaryandSaint John the Evangelistobserve from the left. Although somecompositionsof the subject also include a crowd of bystanders, Phillip Roos limited his design to the essential figures, thereby focusing attention on the central body ofChrist. Roos's frenzied dark lines contribute to the scene's power and drama. He outlined the cross, figures, and drapery using pen and brown ink, before adding sweeping strokes of graywashto heighten the stormy atmosphere. Scholars previously thought that Roos drew only landscape and animal studies, yet this sheet shows him capable of managing complex figure compositions. As he prominently signed and inscribed the workinvinit,a Latin phrase meaning to invent or design, Roos himself was obviously proud of this drawing.
This image of a well-dressed man reveals special attention to the traditional guidelines for good portraiture. He stands straight in a three-quarter pose from the waist up, gazing studiously just out of camera range, his left hand thrust inside his topcoat. Aided by carefully controlled lighting, the image emphasizes the man's intense eyes as a means of displaying his intellectual and moral character. The photograph thus exemplifies the idea that the human face is the mirror of the soul.
A personification of Fortune bestows symbols of wealth, status, and power on dumb animals who neither need nor deserve them. Fortune is usually represented with a blindfold, but Salvator Rosa showed her fully aware of her favors. Similarly, the cornucopia is usually shown facing upward; by depicting it overturned, Rosa expressed reckless extravagance.The beasts, portrayed with stark realism, trample the attributes of art and learning, including books and apalette. Draped in the cardinal red of the Catholic Church, an ass shields an owl, the symbol for wisdom, from the light. Bitter over his exclusion from papal patronage, Rosa included personal references: a book bearing his monogram and a pig stepping on a rose, which alludes to his name.As a satire of Pope Alexander VII's nepotistic artistic patronage, this painting nearly sent Rosa to prison. After showing it privately in his studio, he flagrantly disregarded all advice and exhibited it publicly in the Pantheon in 1659.Allegory of Fortunearoused such a furor that only intervention by the pope's brother saved him.
At the beginning of Aeneas's journey, the epic tale told by Virgil in theAeneid,the god Tiber comes to Aeneas in a dream to tell him of his destiny. Aeneas lies sleeping, still wearing his armor and resting his head on his shield.Compared to other known chalk works by Salvator Rosa, this drawing is unsually large and complete. Not only have the figures been carefully built up with black and white chalk, but the background is filled with wild lines that emphasize the drama of the scene. Scholars have identified this drawing as a finished study for Rosa's etching of the same subject made about 1663.
A group of men and boys, gathered at the entrance of Chick's Candy Store, pass the time in conversation in this photograph taken on a chilly New York day. All eyes are on one man in particular, who confidently leans against the shop window, one hand in his pocket, the other gesturing animatedly. This photograph was made in a working-class neighborhood in the Lower East Side in 1938, during the worst year of the Depression. The subjects' well-dressed appearance suggests that they are probably employed. The woman seated in the doorway beside the candy store, entertained by activity along the street, conveys the sense of dejection that many felt during this time. For generations, local shops in New York City have continued to serve as gathering places for neighborhood residents.Walter Rosenblum made this photograph in the neighborhood where he grew up. The image is part of a larger photographic essay on Pitt Street that was made over a six-month period. In 1950, Rosenblum returned to Pitt Street, making a second series of photographs documenting the vulnerability and hopefulness evident in the neighborhood.
In this image by Walter Rosenblum, a young girl with polio stands apart from the crowd, staring at the photographer. Rosenblum made this portrait along Rivington Street in New York's Lower East Side. While the girl gazes at him, all other eyes are drawn toward what appears to have been a scuffle between some boys. This scene documents the type of everyday activity with which Rosenblum would have been familiar. Rosenblum made the picture in the Lower East Side neighborhood where he grew up. This image is part of Rosenblum's photographic essay entitled  Pitt Street,  which documents the daily life of residents in this community. Rosenblum undertook the project in response to an assignment by the Photo League, an association of photographers dedicated to socially conscious documentary work. The Pitt Street project forecast the direction of Rosenblum's career, which has continued to explore urban neighborhoods in the South Bronx, Harlem, and Haiti.
Walter Rosenblum captured this image of a vulnerable young boy on a rooftop in New York's Lower East Side. Wedged into a corner of zigzagging walls and dwarfed by the city around him, the boy appears to be trapped. Behind him, the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, hints at the world beyond the big city.Known for its tenement housing, the Lower East Side has been home to lower- and middle-class people, particularly immigrants, since the 1900s. Its residents often found relief from crowded apartments and chaotic streets by climbing to their rooftops. Rosenblum made this photograph as part of a second series of images on Pitt Street, where he grew up. Both series' of images celebrate the common dignity of people found in a closely-knit neighborhood.
The Zeyt'un Gospels, made in thescriptoriumat Hromklay for Katholikos Constantine I in 1256, are the earliest signed work of T'oros Roslin, the most accomplishedilluminatorand scribe in Armenia in the 1200s. Thesecanon tableswere separated from themanuscriptat some point in the past and eventually acquired by the Getty Museum, while the rest of the manuscript is in a public collection in Armenia.Originally designed byEusebius of Caesareain the 300s, canon tables provide a concordance of related passages that describe the same events in more than one of the four Gospels. By the early Middle Ages, the columns of numbers were usually assembled within painted architectural structures. Though Roslin used this traditional format in all of his pages, he endlessly varied the ornamental designs andnaturalisticelements, imbuing each page with individuality and vitality.Armenia established its own independent church in the 300s, distinct from both the Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions. In medieval Armenia, religious books such as this one were believed to serve as heavenly intercessors for those involved with the books' creation, patronage, or restoration;Gospelbooks are among the most sumptuous of Armenian manuscripts.
Two elegant birds with their wings spread seem to have just caught the fish wriggling in their mouths. They stand atop acanon tablethat assembles passages from all four Gospels recounting the same event. Although the lively birds, elaborate decorative panels, candlesticks, trees, and figure-topped columns do not relate to the subject matter of the Gospels, they provide a welcome diversion for the eye in what would otherwise be an undifferentiated page full of information.
The two tall birds who peer inquisitively at each other at the top of thisilluminatedcanon tablepage echo the appearance of similar birds at the top of the facing page. Indeed, many of the samemotifsare used on both pages to unite the two-page spread. The inanimate objects such as the candlesticks, the decorative panels, and the figure-topped columns are identical, but the artist has added variety by changing the positions of the living creatures. While the birds at the top of the facing page are in motion, spreading their wings, the two birds at the top of this page are at rest, their wings folded. Likewise, the small birds on the opposite page which are peacefully perched on top of the trees are here transformed into birds of prey, diving down in swift action. These minor adjustments by the artist, T'oros Roslin, unify the pages while adding visual interest.
On thiscanon tablepage from the Zeyt'un Gospels, the scribe andilluminatorT'oros Roslin wrote the Armenian numerals in black ink and strictly aligned them in gold rectangles. Framing the numbers, the architecture and its embellishments are a riot of dynamic color and pattern, bothnaturalisticand abstract. Interlace made from strands of varied colors punctuates the columns; and the upper story, or the attic, contains abstract leaves arranged around concentric horseshoe arches with a center infill of interlace. The rigidity of the geometric pattern is relieved by the many lively birds, like the wide-eyed owls perched atop the flanking trees, and the delicately painted plants, including those emerging from a jewel-encrusted urn at the top of the image. Similar themes appear on the facingfolio, visually linking the two images across the double page spread.
On this page of thecanon tablesfrom the Zeyt'un Gospels, the left side displays the concordances among the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and John, while the right side has two columns of numbers indicating common passages found in only Matthew and Luke. Theilluminatorof this image, T'oros Roslin, paid homage to his teacher Yohannes by taking the format of this page directly from one of Yohannes'smanuscripts.Each set of canon tables usually occupied numerous consecutive pages, challenging the illuminator to keep the traditional architectural structure of canon tables from becoming tedious. Roslin approached the problem by closely relating the images of the facing sides of a double-page spread while varying the small-scale details. For instance, though the birds and plants are of the same kind on thisfolioand the facing canon table page, the jewelry-work designs in the attic use different geometric shapes.
On this lavishly paintedcanon tablepageilluminatedby T'oros Roslin, the architecture houses columns of numbers indicating those passages that are common to two Gospels. In the left column are passages common to Matthew and Luke and in the right, passages common to Matthew and Mark. On the sides, birds balance on the uppermost branches of pomegranate trees to peck at the capitals. Above them, fantastic shrubs, topped by symmetrically posed birds, sprout from planters. Atop the rectangular structure, roosters extend their long necks, with their fluffy feathers highlighted by gold paint. The handling of these closely observed elements from nature contrasts with the tightly controlled geometric shapes of the architecture. Roslin used similar details on the facingfolioto link the two images across the double page spread.
In thiscanon tablefrom the Zeyt'un Gospels, theilluminatorT'oros Roslin enlivened the tightly controlled geometry of the architecture with minutely observednaturalisticdetails. Abstract leaf forms, zigzags, bunches of grapes, and, in the upper quadrants, disembodied mask-like heads, fill the rigid, geometrically divided attic above the columns. The carefully balanced plants and animals on the edges form a loose frame around the architecture, which is itself symmetrical. The use of similarmotifs, like the same roosters and pomegranate trees, on thisfolioand the facing page unites the double-page spread, providing evidence of Roslin's sensitive planning of hismanuscriptproject.
Like the othercanon tablepages from the Zeyt'un Gospels, thisilluminationis notable for its busy decoration, varied color, and architectural structure. Some of these features recall the characteristics ofByzantinechurch architecture as discussed in literature. The Byzantine author Procopius, for example, described the great church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in this way:  Who could recount the beauty of the columns and marbles. . . . For one would surely marvel at the purple hue of some, the green of others, at those on which the crimson blooms. . . . And so the visitor's mind is lifted up to God. . . . In this canon table, which is heavily indebted to Byzantine art, Procopius's aesthetic of colorful variety instilling wonder in the viewer was surely still at work. The diversity of hue--green, blue, orange, gold, and pink--and the foliate decoration of the framework surrounding the text must have suggested a similar heavenly context to themanuscript'sreaders.
All the pages of thecanon tablesfrom the Armenian Zeyt'un Gospels employ a similar architectural structure to house the concordance of the Gospels. TheilluminatorT'oros Roslin also consistently used small-scale jewelry-workmotifs, here the four-part flowers, zigzags, and enamel-like shading that fills in the attic supported by the columns. To the sides of the architectural framework, scrollwork rises from horns of plenty. The upper ones in particular recall the balanced spiraling vines seen in western EuropeanGothicilluminations. The appearance of a western motif such as scrollwork provides evidence of the complexity and richness of resources available to Roslin. The artist's treatment of the columns and capitals here is different from those on other pages. The mazelike patterning on the columns and the looseness of the handling of the leaves on the capitals denies the structural stability of the architectural supports.
Dante Gabriel Rossetti sharplyforeshortenedElizabeth Siddal's sleeping body, allowing her voluminous skirt to dominate the drawing'sforegroundwhile her torso and head, more faintly drawn, recede in thebackground. Siddal began sitting for Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood artists in 1849, when she was about fifteen. By 1852 she was working exclusively for painter-poet Rossetti and became his lover and his pupil. Rossetti made more than sixty intimate drawings of her in the 1850s, in which she usually appeared in some type of repose.
Typically, Rosso Fiorentino enlivened this single figure with spirited hand gestures and complex patterns of elaborate drapery folds. He identified Empedocles by including the crescent moon with rays of light and a hand pointing upward to the sun. The figure's grave expression and walking stance refer to his serious concerns and his travels.A Greek philosopher, poet, orator, religious teacher, naturalist, and founder of the Italian school of medicine, Empedocles was active around 444 B.C. in Sicily. Although born wealthy, he zealously supported the poor and participated in a revolution against tyrannical leadership but refused an invitation to become king.French engraver Ren Boyvin used this drawing as the basis for his print of Empedocles. The outlines show that Boyvin traced it with a stylus for transfer; the resulting printed image is a reverse of the drawing. Another artist copied Boyvin's print for an engraving of Saint Roch in 1563. Empedocles' reputation for curative powers in his own time, even for averting epidemics, may have suggested an analogy with Saint Roch, the Christian saint of protection against the plague.
You see the girl--that's effect one. You see the ad [the blond woman]--that's effect two. But the third effect is when you see both images together and recognize the irony.Arthur Rothstein understood and believed in the power of photography to make social commentary. Working for the United States government, Rothstein photographed Artelia Bendolph in Alabama, to illustrate the effects of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenancy Act of 1937. The serious, weighted expression on the child's face poignantly illustrates her disenfranchised social and economic position. The framing of the crude cabin window and the newspaper insulation with its unattainable food advertisements reinforce her isolation from the recovering American economy.
Henri Rousseau commemorated the one-hundredth anniversary of the proclamation of the first French Republic in 1792. Peasants dance thefarandole,a popular southern French dance, around three liberty trees and two female figures representing the First and Third Republics. Rousseau copied the dancers from a French magazine illustration but added waving banners, the liberty poles, and theallegoricalfigures. A wagon in thebackgroundis full of costumed musicians, reminiscent of parades the artist had seen. He used brilliant colors and solid forms to express the happiness of the scene symbolizing good government. To the right, the erect posture of the dignified republican leaders signals the solidity of the French Republic.
The wide, smooth river Loing, a branch of the Seine, wraps around the Forest of Fontainebleau, located fifty miles south of Paris. In this drawing Thodore Rousseau focused on the large expanse of sky that seems to compress the land into a flat, dark band beneath it. Only a few trees and rocky outcrops project upwards, breaking the winding lines of the river and sandy banks.Rousseau produced the scene outside in the open air, near the village of Barbizon, an area popularized by the group of artists who gathered there in the mid-1800s. They came to draw and paint the region's varied topography, where lush glades of oak and beech give way to semi-deserts of sand, scrub, and pines. Rousseau was particularly fond of the Forest of Fontainebleau, producing many scenes of it for over thirty years. In this drawing, sketched near the end of his life, he concentrated more on the movement of the clouds in the sky than on the details on the land, preferring to reduce individual elements to simple patterns of light and shadow.
Thodore Rousseau thought of trees as almost human. He called his drawings of trees  portraits  and the trees themselves  beings.  His rendering of a pathway winding through an old forest demonstrates this affinity for natural entities. Zigzags of chalk and a line of trees give the hillside a rugged character, defining a downhill slope from the left side of the drawing to the lower right corner. There, Rousseau incorporated aserpentinecreek with curved lines along the right side, leading to a distant, small town with a church. At the far left of the drawing, a person stands on the pathway, providing a sense of scale and distance.The artists of theBarbizon Schoolwere among the first to paint and drawenplein air, taking their tools outdoors to create their works of art, rather than inventing a scene from memory in a studio. In keeping with the Barbizon School's techniques, Rousseau captured the essence of the trees, giving them body and form, but rendered details such as leaves minimally with short strokes of chalk. The one gnarled, old tree at left that receives special attention becomes the focus of the image.On the verso, Rousseau used graphite to sketch trees surrounding a cottage. As in the recto, the trees are drawn with few particulars, emphasizing their shape over other details.
A live oak dominates this late afternoon landscape. Diffuse light from the overcast sky reflects off the pond and up into the branches. The boulders, grass and broken branches in the foreground are barely suggested and the single figure making his way around the pond followed by a herd of cows is thinly sketched.Landscape painter Thodore Rousseau lived in the nearby village of Barbizon, returning often to the forest of Fontainebleau to paint. When commercial exploitation threatened the forest, Rousseau wrote to the Duke of Morny, an influential politician close to Napoleon III, to urge the preservation of the forest.During the summer Rousseau made use of a special easel and lean-to to facilitate painting outdoors. This painting belongs to a category known asdessin-peinturein which the artist notes the composition on site in chalk and thin layers of paint, and then returns to the studio to enhance particular elements and unite the composition.
The painted doors and panels and thegiltplasterreliefsculptures in the overdoors in this room come from the main reception room of a house built for Jean-Baptiste Hosten. Hosten, a wealthy planter from Santo Domingo, commissioned the celebrated architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux to build his Paris residence, the Maison Hosten, starting around 1790. This building was the focus of a larger housing scheme and was to be surrounded by fifteen other townhouses built on speculation. When theFrench Revolutionforced Hosten to flee France in 1795, only six of the townhouses along with this one had been completed. The paneling in this room was removed at the end of the 1800s when the entire house was demolished.In this project, one of Ledoux's last, the architect called on some of the most celebrated painters and sculptors of his era to implement his decorative scheme. Thegrotesquedecoration, which combines graceful arabesques and wingedcentaurswithpalmettesandsphinxes, shows some of the finest decorative work of the late 1700s.
The painted doors and panels and thegiltplasterreliefsculptures in the overdoors in this room come from the main reception room of a house built for Jean-Baptiste Hosten. Hosten, a wealthy planter from Santo Domingo, commissioned the celebrated architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux to build his Paris residence, the Maison Hosten, starting around 1790. This building was the focus of a larger housing scheme and was to be surrounded by fifteen other townhouses built on speculation. When theFrench Revolutionforced Hosten to flee France in 1795, only six of the townhouses along with this one had been completed. The paneling in this room was removed at the end of the 1800s when the entire house was demolished.In this project, one of Ledoux's last, the architect called on some of the most celebrated painters and sculptors of his era to implement his decorative scheme. Thegrotesquedecoration, which combines graceful arabesques and wingedcentaurswithpalmettesandsphinxes, shows some of the finest decorative work of the late 1700s.
When this drawing was made in 1785, contemporary viewers would have easily identified the principal figure of the tall gentleman near the center of the crowded theater lobby as Colonel George Hanger, a friend of the Prince of Wales, later George IV. Thomas Rowlandson showed him assessing two pretty young girls, while a trio of older and less savory characters whisper to each other at the left. One of the gentlemen pays a fat older woman for an unspecified reason. To the right, a man in the crowd studies other young women through hislorgnette, while a short gentleman mistakenly approaches an annoyed middle-aged lady. The sharp linearity of the drawing emphasizes the rich variety of characters and the humorous, biting view of human foibles.Renowned in his lifetime as a political caricaturist, Rowlandson produced this large drawing for an etching that was published on January 5, 1786. In the printed version of this scene, the artist added a playbill to the wall that advertised:  The Way of the World  and  Who's the Dupe  , further emphasizing the drawing's satire.
Therectoor front of this sheet depicts three independent groups of apostles and two faint, lightly drawn sketches all related to a representation of the Last Supper. Peter Paul Rubens drew on many Italian models, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, and Michelangelo, for inspiration in depicting the individual apostles. Rubens used a thin, fine line for the monumental figures of the apostles and cross-hatching to convey their solid forms.Theverso, or reverse side of the page, shows several studies of Medea and her slain children. According to Greek legend, Medea, a princess of the foreign kingdom of Colchis, was married to Jason, who eventually left her to marry a native Greek woman. A passionate and jealous woman, Medea stopped at nothing to obtain revenge, including murdering her own children. On the right, long, sweeping lines animate the figure of Medea, whose gaping mouth seems to emit anguished wails. Rubens depicted her striding forward as she roughly carries her children, their bodies limp in death.
In a technique known by the French termcorch,three figures appear as if without skin. Drawn in luminous light brown ink, the principal figure demonstrates the muscular structure of the back, buttocks, and legs. Fascinated with the structure of the human body, Peter Paul Rubens then drew two subsidiary views of the same powerful form and a detail of the left arm from a different angle.Rubens produced this drawing sometime during an eight-year stay in Italy, and it shows the strong influence of the new approaches he learned there. The skillfully drawn forms show his complex grasp of the human body in three dimensions. The main figure's truncated right arm suggests the artist's study of brokenantiquestatues, while the surging, heroically proportioned forms and the extensive hatching of the musculature display his familiarity with Michelangelo's drawings. Scholars believe that Rubens produced this anatomical drawing in preparation for an instructional book on human anatomy, which he never published. After the artist's death, a printer published an engraving of this drawing in the mid-1600s.
Amid the disarray ofVulcan'sforge,Venusleans into the embrace of her lover,Mars, who is transfixed by her alluring gaze. Caught up in his attraction to the aggressively seductive goddess, Mars is no longer able to carry out his military exploits. Venus removes his helmet, while mischievousputticavort with his sword and shield.In the 1600s, the subject of Venus disarming her lover Mars was understood as anallegoryof Peace. Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder's interpretation of the subject, however, emphasizes the fragility of peace. Weapons production continues in thebackgroundat the burning fires of Vulcan's hearth, signaling that love's conquest of war may be only temporary.Rubens and Brueghel, who were close colleagues, collaborated on at least twenty-five paintings. This painting displays each virtuoso's talents: Rubens's robust figural style and Brueghel's intricate still life details. The luminous figure of Venus, the reflective quality of the weapons and armor, and the tactile quality of the lush painting testify to their skill.
The boar was furiously twisting its body round and round, its jaws slavering with foam and fresh blood...the hero who had dealt the wound came up close to the animal and roused his foe to fury, before finally burying his shining spear in its shoulder.-Ovid,MetamorphosesWrapped in a flowing red cape, the warrior Meleager thrusts his spear into the shoulder of a massive boar. The ferocious creature--seemingly undaunted by a pair of hounds latched onto its bristled hide--has turned to confront head-on its human adversary. Meleager's blow will prove to be fatal to the boar, but the beast has proven itself as a fearsome foe. Beneath its imposing hooves lie the disemboweled carcass of a hound and the prostrate corpse of the hunter, Ancaeus.The story of the Calydonian boar hunt was told and retold during antiquity--most famously inOvid'sMetamorphoses.When King Oeneus of Calydon failed to honor the goddess Diana with offerings, she released a terrifying boar on his land. The king's son, Meleager, assembled a group of renowned warriors to slay the beast. Several of the huntsmen were killed or maimed before Meleager finally defeated the boar. He presented its head as a trophy to his beloved, the huntress Atalanta, who is seen behind Meleager, with bow in hand.Peter Paul Rubens created this painting a few years after an extended stay in Italy. He drew from ancientsarcophagiand statues he had seen there for the poses of many of the figures. For example, the boar seen in profile was taken directly from a well-known marble in Florence's Uffizi Gallery. Rubens's appropriation of iconic images fromantiquitywas intended to resonate with learned viewers. For the figures on horseback, Rubens borrowed from hisRenaissancepredecessors, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. But Rubens's dynamic and inventive interpretation of the hunt was wholly his own. With this painting, he established the theme of the epic combat between man and animal, a subject to which he would return throughout his career.
Peter Paul Rubens depicted the moment after theCrucifixionand before theResurrectionwhenChristis placed into the tomb. He is being supported by those closest to him in life: John theEvangelist, in a brilliant red robe, bears the weight of Christ; Mary Magdalene cries in thebackground; while Mary, the mother of James the Younger andJoseph, bows her head in sorrow. Mary, the mother of Christ, cradles his head and looks heavenward for divine intercession.TheEntombmentwas meant to make the viewer's religious experience personal and encourage the faithful to imagine the physical horror of Christ's Crucifixion. Christ's tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christ's side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.This painting was probably made to serve as analtarpiecein a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist. The slab on which the body is placed suggests an altar, while the sheaf of wheat alludes to the bread of the Eucharist, the equivalent of Christ's body in theMass.
In 1612 Jan and Balthasar Moretus, the owners of Antwerp's Plantin Press, commissioned their friend Peter Paul Rubens to design thirteen illustrations for a newBreviarium Romanum,the Catholicprayer book; this drawing and the twelve others were completed by March 1614. A friend since childhood, Balthasar Moretus would in his later years write of Rubens,  I loved this young man who had the most perfect and the most amiable character. Theassumption of the Virginwas a subject to which Rubens repeatedly returned throughout his career. In this version, the controlled,classicalcompositionechoes one of Titian'saltarpiecesof the same subject. The bravura style ofBaroqueItalian painters also influenced Rubens's ebullient and dramaticallyforeshortenedputti.Rubens began drawing in chalk, which he then covered over with pen, ink, andwash. The chalk underdrawing contains severalpentimenti,which are most obvious in the figure of the Virgin. These changes of mind, as well as the indents for transfer onto the plate are probably evidence that this drawing was the final of several studies, not the final sheet from which the engraver would work.
Peter Paul Rubens created this drawing to be engraved for a new edition of theBrevarium Romanum,the Catholicprayer bookorbreviary. Among Rubens's most richly worked drawings for theBrevarium,this scene is notable for its nocturnalillumination. To create the effect of evening, he bathed the entire page in tones of brownwash. He then used whitebodycolorto suffuse the onlookers in theChristChild's miraculous holy light, a concept ultimately derived from Correggio's art.In this sheet, Rubens's drawing betrays an artist who thinks primarily as a painter, softening outlines and building up shapes that then take on life and color. Even in this very finished drawing, he characteristically sacrificed detail to gain a sense of movement and energy.For twenty-five years, Rubens supplied his boyhood friend Balthasar Moretus, head of Antwerp's Plantin Press, with illustrations for books ranging from the philosophy of Seneca to a treatise on optics. Moretus informed him well in advance about the illustrations required; during this time, Rubens jotted down many ideas that he worked into designs for engravings, as in this drawing.
While this wagon recurs in several paintings, Peter Paul Rubens may have intended this drawing as an independent work of art, rather than a study. Although itscompositionis simple, this humblegenre scenedisplays Rubens's characteristic lively technique. The sharpperspective, unusual rear view, and lack of alignment between front and rear axles draw the viewer into the space. The splayed side rails and wheel spokes all thrust outward in repeating lines, charging the stationary wagon with energy. Rubens's experiments with different positions for the rustic wagon and the farmer's flail further increase the effect of motion and symmetry.Rubens varied both his materials and his technique to give the scene immediacy and vigor. The man's red shirt adds to his sense of animation and becomes a focal point of the drawing. Subtlehighlightsappear in other colors of chalk: yellow inside the wagon, a bit of blue on the barn roof, and touches of brown on wagon wheels and the ground. Rubens's chalk strokes ranged from the stronger, more precise forms of the wagon, whose iron bands and nails are accented in pen and ink, to the light, rapid, strokes employed for the stable and hay.
The robust figure of Diana strides into theforeground, swathed in a blood-red robe and clasping a spear behind her back. Much activity surrounds her: a dog jumps up at her side and asatyrtries to steal a kiss from one of hernymphsas another figure shouts behind him. The rhythmiccomposition, colors, and textures create a lifelike sensuousness, demonstrating theFlemishpainter's mastery of Venetian color and his study of Roman art.Peter Paul Rubens ran a prolific workshop and was able to meet the demand for his pictures by using assistants extensively. Images like this one were designed by Rubens, painted by the assistants, and given finishing touches by the master.
Peter Paul Rubens probably made this study of a man in Korean costume as an independent work of art. Since contact between Europe and Korea was almost non-existent in Rubens's time, how he came into contact with Korean silk robes and transparent headdress  in Antwerp remains a mystery.In thebackground, Rubens sketched a small boat to emphasize a distant place, but he was clearly more interested in the costume than in providing a detailed setting.The drawing is one of Rubens's most meticulous depictions, enriched by touches of red chalk added to the man's face. Fascinated by the play of light on the silk, Rubens juxtaposed black chalk and white paper to create the man's shimmering costume. This drawing later inspired one of the central figures in Rubens's paintingThe Miracles ofSaint FrancisXavierin the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.
Skillfully copying a study by Peter Paul Rubens, this unknown artist, probably an assistant in Rubens's studio, explored a variety of facial expressions and poses while retaining the liveliness and immediacy of Rubens's original sketch. Using a single dim source of light, he created strong contrasts of brightness and shadow on the man's skin, varying these along with the different expressions. He aptly captured Rubens's great achievement--the three-dimensional quality of his modeling and the pulsating vitality he bestowed on painted human flesh.Rubens produced a celebrated series of studio heads, executing some from life and inventing others from imaginary stock figure types. He kept thesepreliminary studiespermanently on hand in the studio for reference. These studies of an African may have been used as a source for one of the kings in the Adoration of theMagi, who was often depicted as a Moor. Aside from this subject, images of African figures were uncommon in EuropeanRenaissanceandBaroqueart.
With its horizontal format, this biblical scene of classically proportioned figures arranged in graceful poses resembles an ancient Romanfrieze. Facial expressions and dramatic gestures serve anarrativepurpose, revealing the story for the viewer. Rubens used vivid reds, blues, and yellows to describe shimmering silks and heavy cloaks. On the right, helmets and armor worn by the soldiers gleam in the bright sunlight.The painting depicts the meeting ofAbigailandDavid. Abigail's husband, Nabal of Carmel, foolishly refused to pay for the protection that David had provided for Nabal's shepherds. Angered, David set off to avenge this misdeed with a large group of soldiers. Seeking forgiveness for her husband's offense, Abigail, shown kneeling in theforegroundon the left, offers bread, wine, corn, raisins, and fig-cakes to David and his men. Impressed by Abigail's beauty and generosity, David dismounts and attempts to raise Abigail up. Although not shown here, the story ends with Nabal's dying from a stroke after learning of the disaster his wife had averted. David then proposed marriage to Abigail.
This oil sketch ormodellowas commissioned by Prince-Bishop Viet Adam for the mainaltarpieceof FreisingCathedralin southern Germany. In the center theVirgin Maryholds theChristChild while trampling the serpent of sin, who curls around the moon at her feet. To the left theArchangel Michaeland angels cast out Satan, the  great red dragon with seven heads,  and other ghoulish demons. Above, God the Father instructs an angel to place a pair of wings on the Virgin's shoulders.Peter Paul Rubens contrasted good with evil by juxtaposing the agony and gruesomeness of the demons as they fall into hell with the Virgin and Child rising heavenward at the right. Rapid and gestural brushstrokes lend immediacy and drama to the scene.
When Peter Paul Rubens decided to have an engraving made after his 1618altarpieceof theAssumption of the Virgin,a young member of his studio, Paulus Pontius, made a detailed drawing of the painting in black chalk. Scholars believe that little evidence of Pontius's design remains. Rubens extensively reworked the drawing, probably in an effort to instruct Pontius on how to make good engravings after his paintings, an activity that Rubens considered very important. The young Pontius went on to become one of the most successful interpreters of Rubens's work through engravings.
Arms outstretched,Saint Francisof Paola levitates while surrounded by a divine light. The crowd surges towards the saint, whose expression conveys his communion with God at the apex of thecomposition. Famed for his miraculous healing powers, Saint Francis of Paola was invited to France by the sickly KingLouis XI, who is shown at the left with his royal court. In theforeground, a man and woman in paroxysms of insanity are restrained while awaiting their cure. To their right, a dead man comes to life as a sheet is symbolically lifted from his face. An assortment of people, some afflicted with blindness, deafness, lameness, or the infirmities of old age, ascend the stairs. The varied gestures and expressions enhance the dramatic effect of the whole.
On a diplomatic mission to Spain in 1628, Peter Paul Rubens visited the royal palace in Madrid. Admiring three paintings by Titian that hung in adjacent rooms, he quickly sketched some of the profiles of various women he saw portrayed, interminglingmotifsfrom the various works on a single sheet.Rubens focused on the angle and expression on each head, as well as the elaborately braided hairstyle and jewelry. By liberally layering in white chalk, the artist created a sensuous play of light over the hair. Smudgy black chalk strokes give volume to another woman's body and describe the muscular ripples on her arms. Rubens's chalk strokes ranged from the stronger, more powerful form of the nude body to the delicate strokes where the hair touches the back of one figure's neck. He very effectively used the combination of red, black, and white chalk, a technique known by the French termaux troix crayons,coined in the 1700s.
Separated into two zones withallegoricalfigures in theforegroundand historical figures in thebackground, Peter Paul Rubens here commemorated the meeting of King Ferdinand III of Hungary and the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand at Nrdlingen on the Danube River on September 2, 1634. Four days later, the two Catholic rulers would combine their armies to win an important victory overProtestantforces. At the upper right, the Cardinal-Infante solemnly greets his cousin Ferdinand.Rubens made this freely drawn oil sketch as amodellofor the right panel of the greatStage of Welcome,a monumental canvas that decorated a triumphal arch erected for the ceremonial entry into Antwerp of the newly appointed governor of the southern Netherlands, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Spain.In the foreground, allegorical figures comment on the significance of the event. At the left a naiad or waternymphrests her arm on thepersonificationof the River Danube, who sits on a urn flowing with blood and water while extending his left arm in a gesture of welcome. Kneeling at the right, the figure of Germania, dressed in black, rests her head on her hand. She gazes mournfully at the viewer while a winged genius draws her attention to the meeting behind her.
After piling a wooden effigy of her deceased husband in their matrimonial bed atop her own funeralpyre, Dido, the queen ofCarthage, stabs herself with her loverAeneas'ssword.Virgiltells the story of her grief-stricken reaction to her abandonment by Aeneas, the hero of theTrojan warand future founder of Rome.The artist emphasizedDido'sferocious passion through the curvaceous twist of her body; he accentuated the scene's gloom through use of somber colors. The burning torch at the upper right provides the only reference to the funeral pyre.Peter Paul Rubens's prolific workshop produced over two thousand works of art. Rubens typically employed accomplished artists to paint in his style from sketches he supplied. The posthumous inventory of his goods lists a painting called theDeath of Queen Dido,but scholars are uncertain whether it refers to this particular canvas.
Peter Paul Rubens often painted multiple versions of paintings, and many contemporary and later copies also often survive. Rubens frequently called upon his sizable workshop to execute his large-scale works, and his enormous popularity in his own and succeeding centuries encouraged the proliferation of copies. This artist emulated Rubens's fluid handling, vigorous contours, andAndromeda'ssubtlecontrappostopose.In the Greek myth ofPerseusand Andromeda, an oracle declared that the beautiful Andromeda must be sacrificed to a sea monster. Chained to a rock near Joppa, she was rescued by Perseus, who subsequently married her.Scholars think that seven versions ofAndromedawere made, although only three are known today. The other two versions of this subject include Perseus as well as an assisting angel. In this scene, Andromeda tearfully welcomes the angel, who will melt the chain with fire.
Albert Rudomine was particularly interested in portraiture and the study of the human body--the latter a standard preoccupation among dance photographers. Here he examined the nude male form, evoking ancient sculpture and theclassicalreverence for the ideal beauty of the male body.
Bathed in sunlight breaking through the clouds, a rustic sluice, used to regulate water levels and irrigate farmland, sits above abackgroundof productive pastureland. Jacob van Ruisdael, one of the great Dutch landscape painters of the 1600s, explored a range of landscapemotifsin his work, including forest scenes, seascapes, beach scenes, and panoramic landscapes. InBridge with a Sluice,Ruisdael made an ordinary object monumental by making it larger than all the other elements in the painting, thereby calling attention to its use and placement in the countryside. The diagonal movement of the rugged road at the left draws the eye up toward the sluice and then down to the land below. A single figure populates the scene, but the sluice symbolizes the human presence in nature and human attempts to control it.
For Jacob van Ruisdael, decayed trees with bare, twisted branches could speak as eloquently as thriving ones. The aged tree was a long-standing theme in Dutch andFlemishlandscape imagery, but in Ruisdael's hands it became a very personal expression.Ruisdael focused thiscompositionaround a hollow tree whose bare limbs reach upward: a heroic element in the landscape. Its lifeless skeleton symbolizes the transience of human life, a favorite Ruisdael theme, and reminds viewers of the suffering and endurance required in life. Yet Ruisdael also set the dead tree amidst healthy ones, showing that both life and death have a share in nature. To balance the scene compositionally, Ruisdael contrasted the dramatic tree with a placid stream and picturesque footbridge on the left.Ruisdael began by sketching the composition in black chalk. He then brushed in a range of tones of gray wash, creating a rich diversity of textural and light effects, especially on the right.Subjects reflecting life's uncertainty and brevity were popular in post-Reformation Holland, where religious painting had nearly disappeared. Thevanitasthemes adopted by Dutch still life painters came from the same urge to record the fleeting character of nature.
Jacob van Ruisdael captured the tension between nature's power and human needs. Glimpsed from the bank of a stream amid thick foliage, turbulent waters rush through an open sluice. Inclement weather is suggested by the dark clouds; uneven, craggy branches and spreading trees grow on either side of the river. Against the ominous sky, the buildings appear solid and sturdy, and a solitary male figure with his dog seems dwarfed by the natural setting. Sunlight breaks through the heavily clouded sky and settles on the centralmotifof the two half-timber thatched millhouses.When he was in his early twenties, Ruisdael traveled to Germany from his native Haarlem. He became captivated by watermills on his travels and painted a series of views featuring them as a central motif. This painting is one of six known variations on this theme and the only one that is dated.
Tended by a single, small harvester, a rolling field of golden grain sways gently under a dramatic sky of billowing clouds. In the center, a solitary figure approaches along a winding path. A farmhouse and the steeple of a church can be seen in the far distance.In a poetic, yet convincing manner, Jacob van Ruisdael captured the changing effects of light passing through clouds and the play of sunlight and shadow across the earth. He contrasts the uncut wheat in the field and the newly bound sheaves on the right, the broad expanse of blue sky above and the low, yellow fields below. Dwarfed by their surroundings, the small figures convey the insignificance of humanity in the face of nature.
The Rapidan, a steam locomotive used by the Union Army, moves two engines wrecked by Confederate forces to Alexandria, Virginia, for repair. The Civil War was the first North American conflict to be documented by photographers. This image demonstrates that the new medium elicited a great deal of attention from soldiers, who assembled in front and on top of the train in order to be included in the photograph. The invention and popular spread of photography coincided with the invention and expansion of the railroad in the mid-1800s; each played a significant role in the American Civil War. Railroads were vital for the Union and Confederate armies, who used them to move provisions and weaponry. If one army could destroy the other's engines or rails, it could seriously disable the opposing forces and potentially gain the upper hand in the conflict..
In August 1862, A. J. Russell carefully positioned his camera well below the level of his subject to best capture the magnitude of the destruction of this powerful train. The Charles Minot steam engine was thrown from the tracks as the result of an attack by the Confederate cavalry. During the American Civil War, one of the earliest wars to be extensively photographed, much of the Union Army's efforts was directed at rebuilding bridges and railroads destroyed by retreating Confederate forces. This experience working on railroad projects was a great aid to the nation in later years, when countless well-trained Civil War veterans worked on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. Grenville Dodge, chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad and former General in the Union Army, remarked favorably upon the abilities of former soldiers who undertook backbreaking railroad work:  It was the war that taught them how to think big, how to organize grand projects, how to persevere. 
The second battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, on May 3, 1863, took place at Chancellorsville, a hamlet ten miles west of Fredericksburg. From the vantage point of Marye's Height above the town, Russell photographed wrecked and overturned Confederate gun caissons or ammunition transports.The massacred corpses of the horses that had pulled the caissons lie strewn across the now-impassable road. Herman Haupt, Chief of the Bureau of Military Railways and employer of photographer Andrew Russell, leans against a stump, surveying the destruction caused by a single shell. On May 4, 1863, the Union army was driven from the Fredericksburg Heights in Confederate General Robert E. Lee's last great triumph.
In this photograph of an auger propped up by a folding wooden ruler, light and volume seem more important than the subject. For this picture, Andrew Joseph Russell treated the tool as if it were a sculpture, resting the streamlined, cylindrical handle against a makeshift stand so that the corkscrew-like component remains upright. He photographed it, however, because engineers used such augers to bore holes in the supporting timbers of bridges for the placement of explosives.While a captain in the 141st New York Volunteers, a Union Army infantry unit, Russell worked under Union General Herman Haupt--whose experiments in military engineering are still considered quite ingenious. Russell made photographs showing various techniques for bridge and railroad track construction and destruction. He mounted this image in an album that served as an instruction manual for the use of Haupt's inventions.
The wreck of theCommodore,seen herelying on its side like a toy thrown aside by a temperamental child, was one of innumerable Civil War disasters. Confederate forces regularly tore up railroad tracks in their efforts to impede the movements of the Union Army. To the left of the image, behind the derailed engine, a number of figures stand about, probably assessing the damage.The American Civil War holds the distinction of being the first war that was routinely photographed, but such record-keeping was not limited to documenting battlefields. Andrew Joseph Russell photographed many train wrecks and other war-related scenes.
In 1863 Andrew Joseph Russell became the first member of the Union army officially assigned to photograph the Civil War. Unlike Mathew Brady's images of battlefields, most of Russell's photographs document engineering achievements. Russell worked in the U.S. Military Railroad Construction Corps under the direction of the engineer General Herman Haupt, photographing Haupt's numerous accomplishments in the construction and destruction of roads, railroad tracks, and bridges.Though Russell intended simply to create a record of bridge construction, he did not limit himself to a mundane treatment of the subject. The two halves of the bridge frame the empty water between them like perfect perspectival lines, receding into the distance across the wide Potomac River.
From an elevatedperspective, A. J. Russell made this photograph overlooking the Union Army's plentiful supply of iron rails. Rows of barracks and a train of boxcars fill thebackground. Between the tall, neatly stacked rails rests a train of flatbed cars loaded with more rails. During the American Civil War, the frequent destruction of railroads required a large supply of replacement rails. According to one report, the Union's. Military Railroad purchased over 21,000 tons of track between 1862 and 1865.
The disheveled cast of characters standing on the station platform and alongside the steam engine in this photograph reveals the fierce, untamed spirit for which the Wild West is celebrated. With the exception of the woman at the far right, the rest of the figures form a band of scruffy men. One holds a shotgun, a necessary safeguard during the age of railroad bandits like Jesse James.Perhaps the pipe-smoking engineer in the top hat was responsible for the customized antlers on the front of this shining engine. This ornament reflects the pioneering spirit of the Union Pacific Railroad, which began in Omaha, Nebraska, and made its way through Wyoming to join the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit, Utah.
John Russell's engaging portrait of George de Ligne Gregory was likely painted to celebrate Gregory's appointment as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1793. Gregory, the holder of Harlaxton Manor, is shown wearing the sober, sensible garments typical of a nobleman in the early 1790s: a brown double-breasted wool coat with black collar set against a brilliant white linen cravat. In his hand he casually holds a black hat lined with glowing white satin. Gregory's hat and collar are covered with white powder from his fashionably dressed hair. He is somberly yet richly dressed, alert yet seated at ease. Gregory's decorous pose embodies Russell's ideal of depicting the sitter in a manner appropriate to his age.The portrait's brilliant whites, velvety blacks, and masterful interplay of varied flesh tones with blues are all characteristics of Russell's virtuoso application ofpastel. Russell achieved the even tonality by manually smudging broad, soft areas of crayon onto the paper. He then applied fine, linear flourishes, such as the white highlighting on the cravat and in the hat lining, with a hard, pointed crayon. Russell's technical facility and acute powers of observation resulted in an engaging representation of the sitter.
In this image of the small whaling village of Jisp, people chat and stroll before a row of densely packed wooden buildings typical of North Holland in this era. On the frozen canal at right, others play kolf, a cross between hockey and golf. In the distance, the delicate bare branches of the trees create black tracery against the pale sky, their round tops echoing the curve of the bridges below and arc of birds overhead.Although Rutgers used both copies and his imagination as sources for his drawings, he drew this quintessential Dutch winter genre scene from life. It is one of two drawings the artist did of the same location on different occasions. Rutgers effectively captures the chill of a winter day with crisp pen work, particularly visible in the architectural details, contrasting against the expanse of white paper and gentle grey and brown washes in the sky and bank of snow.Jisp banned construction of new thatch roofs in 1647 as a precautionary measure. The drawing can therefore be dated before 1664, when a significant fire damaged the city, and likely destroyed any thatched roofs in the city. Close observation also reveals that Rutgers used a slightly different ink to draw the figures on the left than the rest of the drawing, suggesting that he was not satisfied with his original composition and added to it at a later time.
Behind a grove of trees, a building looms imposingly. The painting depicts a story taken fromHomer'sOdyssey, in which the sorceress Circe encounters the warrior Ulysses. Descending the palace stairs on the left, Circe greets Ulysses and offers him a magic potion. Previous to his arrival, the sorceress has given the same potion to Ulysses's men, who were then transformed into wild beasts. On the right, one man sports antlers while another one nearby is horrified to find his head changing into that of a wild boar. Unbeknownst to Circe, however, Ulysses has taken an herbal antidote given to him byHermes. Ulysses will overcome the sorceress and force her to restore his men to their normal shape.The tiny figures of Ulysses, Circe, and her entourage are secondary to the magnificently decorated palace, the lush landscape, and the assortment of lively animals. The painting is a collaborative effort of two painters: theFlemishartist Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, a specialist in depicting architecture, painted the palace and garden house, while the German artist Carl Borromus Andreas Ruthart was responsible for thenaturalisticdisplay of animals in theforeground.
A deaf mute, Gaetano Sabatini created the self-portrait in the centermedallionthe year before he died. Wearing a turban, he holds hispaletteand brushes in his left hand while resting his right hand on his maulstick. Sabatini's application of chalk ranges from crisp lines for contours and accents to soft modeling for his face and sleeve. His variety enhances the sensuous quality of the black chalk, giving the viewer a strong sense of its texture and feel.Gaspare Redi, a copyist and mount-maker, created the ornamental frame, or cartouche. Florentine nobleman Francesco Maria Niccol Gabburri, who assembled a large series of drawn portraits and self-portraits of artists, hired them both. Gabburri probably requested that Sabatini use the oval format, which he preferred for his collection. The tradition of collectors using ornamental frames to set off their drawings began with Giorgio Vasari. Unlike Vasari, who decorated a separate sheet to use as hismount, Redi used the same paper as Sabatini, allowing for a better integration of image and the surrounding decorative frame.
Exploring the arrangement and poses of his figures within the arched format, Andrea Sacchi revealed his thought process as he considered options for the physical relationship betweenChristand the kneelingSaint Peter. He drew over Saint Peter in red chalk, deliberating whether to make him a bit taller while retaining the same pose. To fill the lower left of thecomposition, Sacchi faintly sketched in some sheep, which identify the subject asJesusinstructing Saint Peter to  Feed my sheep.  (John 21:15-17) This command, putting Peter in charge of the physical and spiritual sustenance of Jesus' flock, the early Christians, is the source of Peter's position as the first pope.The powerful and wealthy Barberini family, which included Pope Urban VIII as well as several cardinals, commissioned numerous artists to create a series offrescoesillustrating Peter's life for their palazzo. This drawing was one of the many designs produced for the planned wall decorations, but no fresco was ever actually executed.
Light fills the interior of the Church of Saint Bavo in Haarlem, one of the finestGothicbuildings still in existence today. Although Pieter Jansz. Saenredam based his work on careful on-the-spot studies, the painting combines two distinct views, one looking straight ahead and the other toward the chancel on the left. He even added analtarpieceand a stained glass window, which would probably already have been removed from the church by Saenredam's time. By the 1600s,Protestantchurches in Holland had become relatively austere in response to the teachings of theologian John Calvin.The overall impression is one of strong verticality, soaring space, and penetrating light, a spiritual reference to the heavens above. The inclusion of small figures accentuate the viewer's experience of exalted interior space. Saenredam described architectural elements in great detail: vaulted ceilings, moldings, decorative capitals, clustered pillars, and clerestory windows.
In preparation for one of his scrupulously observed paintings of buildings, Pieter Saenredam, known to his contemporaries as the  first portraitist of architecture,  made this drawing as the second of twopreliminary studiesof the choir and north ambulatory of Saint Bavo. He first produced aperspectiverendering in October 1634, working on location inside the church. In his studio a month later, Saenredam transformed the life study into this finely tuned, idealized drawing showing the deep vista from one of the side chapels across the nave to another. According to the inscription, he completed his painting after this drawing on October 15, 1635.Saenredam began the drawing with a series of vertical and horizontal ruled graphite lines that delineate the faces of the side piers and establish a centralvanishing point, clearly visible between the figures in the lower center. He then elaborately finished the sheet in pen and ink,wash, and watercolor. Corrections made during this phase included removing two figures from in front of the columns.
The reposing lion has been disturbed and lets out a ferocious roar revealing its sharp teeth and thick, leathery tongue. With its head tilted slightly upward, light sparkles off the nose, eyes, and left side of its face. The animal's immense front paws are also illuminated from the upper left. By contrast, much of the lion's chest is covered in dark shadows where Cornelis Saftleven used black and brown wash to soften the animal's fur.Dutch artists in the 1600s could study exotic animals--like this North African lion--at fairs and markets, traveling circuses, or one of several menageries or zoos. But artists did not always have the opportunity to work from life and sometimes relied on stuffed animals or the work of their contemporaries as models. This fearsome lion's powerful and animated presence suggests that Saftleven drew it from life. The artist was fascinated by animals and produced both fanciful animalallegoriesand detailed studies of lions, leopards, owls, and monkeys. This work is among the largest and most elaborate of Saftleven's animal studies and was probably intended as a finished work.
Scenes of animals performing human actions and taking over human habitats were popular in Cornelis Saftleven's day. Adding color further enhanced the visual appeal and, hence, marketability of such pictures. Saftleven madeAn Enchanted Cellar with Animals, one of the largest and most elaborate animal fantasies he ever created, as a finished work of art in its own right.Saftleven liberally applied lively black chalk and gray wash and intentionally restrained the use of color. The sparing touches of red, yellow, and blue watercolor heighten the comic subject's playful, festive quality. As he typically did, Saftleven included cooking implements and other bits carelessly strewn about and evoked a mood of enchantment by setting the scene in a shadowy vaulted interior with flying bats. The hidden human observer, here peeking out from the curtained doorway, was a stock figure in Netherlandish satirical and moralizing imagery of the 1500s and 1600s.
Between 1648 and 1652, Herman Saftleven the Younger concentrated on drawing imaginary mountain landscapes featuring large, prominent rock formations and distant views that dominate small figures. Although in this drawing he has created a natural-looking scene, many of his drawings are not topographical and he often used interchangeablemotifs. These fantastic, vaguely Central European views reflect the influence of Roelandt Savery's rugged, fictitious mountain landscapes, such as Savery'sLandscape with Waterfall, created about thirty years earlier than Saftleven's drawing.At a time when travel was difficult, landscape drawings and prints gave people both a means and an excuse to conjure up exotic, far-flung lands. More than 1,200 of Saftleven's topographical and imaginary landscape drawings survive, most of which are finished, large-scale drawings made for collectors.
A young herdsman stares wistfully out from underneath a large, tattered hat, engaging the viewer with his direct gaze. He leans against a longhoulette,a tool consisting of a narrow metal scoop attached to the end of a pole, which he would use to dig up small clods of earth, throwing them behind him to create a trail for his animals to follow. The oversized, ragged clothes he wears suggest both his youth and his poverty. The billowing folds of the frayed cape, big shoes, and peaked hat envelop the slight frame of the boy, emphasizing the poignant, shy smile on his face. In a mixture of chalk and wash, Herman Saftleven the Younger emphasized the play of sunlight and shadow over the boy's body.In the 1600s, Dutch artists first began to sketch the poor in their works of art, capturing not only their poverty, but also their rustic beauty and dignity. Saftleven sketched this boy, probably hoping to use his image in one of his paintings.
In this ambitious composition, fifty figures occupy themselves in activities ranging from the pure frivolity of dancing to the tenderness of a caress shared by mother and child. Inspired by Jean-Antoine Watteau'sftes galantes,in which elegant people engage in a variety of diversions, often in an idealized park or garden setting, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin devised a similar rural subject.During the 1700s, country dances had become a popular form of summer entertainment for Parisian society. A tireless chronicler of his time, Saint-Aubin surely would have viewed these dances and theatrical performances on the outskirts of Paris. Drawing on the wit and meticulous observation seen in Dutch paintings of peasants in the 1500s and 1600s, Saint-Aubin refined the rustic folk in a characteristically French Rococo treatment.
Although the various drawings on this page were executed in different media and at different times, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin achieved a remarkable sense of balance and unity among the motifs. The two most prominent sketches--theBirth of Venus, a drawing after a contemporary sculpture in the upper left, and a seated woman reading in the lower right--are joined by two fascinating characters. A black-chalk drawing of a seated writer appears to float between the two larger sketches of theBirth of Venus. A drawing of a young artist at work, executed in pen and ink and red and white chalk, appears in the lower left corner.Saint-Aubin brought together many of his favorite subjects--the artist at work, women reading, and contemporary art--in a lively and engaging way on this sheet. While drawing in his sketchbook, he kept in mind the arrangement of elements, cleverly organizing the subjects so that they correspond to one another. The statue, for example, forms a visual parallel with the reading woman, as both figures look down to the right. Saint-Aubin also added an area of red watercolor on the right side of the sheet, echoing the red-chalk drawing of the artist at work and thereby balancing the composition.
The sea teems with a seemingly endless fleet of warships; a vast battle looms, ships crowd closer and closer to one another. Rows of oars froth up the sea, the frenzied water foreshadowing the impending combat. Standing at opposite ends of the two central ships are the leaders of warring factions. On one deck is the stoic Roman general Regulus, commanding his followers as they attempt to board an enemy ship. Opposing Regulus is the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar Barca, father of the famed general Hannibal. In fanciful reference to Hannibal, the Carthaginian prows are elephant heads armed with imposing ramming tusks.Gabriel Jacques de Saint-Aubin meticulously described every detail of the foreground ships. He first drew the composition in black chalk and then used pen and ink to further articulate details of the ships, such as their masts and riggings, and the myriad figures. Using a limited palette of deftly applied watercolor--gray, brown, and blue--Saint-Aubin sensitively colored the sea and sky.The first Punic War (264-241 BC) was a conflict largely fought at sea. Involving over three hundred vessels, the battle depicted here was one of the largest navel battles in history. The smaller Roman fleet defeated the Carthaginian by dividing their forces into four squadrons and waging four separate battles.This drawing is one of a series of illustrations Saint-Aubin made in the 1760s for an ambitious history of Rome. Engravings after drawings as well as maps were to accompany this multi-volume series which was never completed. In 1789, twenty-nine engraved plates from Saint-Aubin's drawings illustrated a more modest Roman history.
Decorated with a finely painted pattern of bluelambrequins, the ewer and basin would have sat on a dressing table to be used for washing in a bedroom orchambre de toilette. Themotifswere influenced by the engravings of Jean Brain, chief designer toLouis XIV. The simple silvermounts, made in Paris around 1720 and decorated with gadrooning, are a rare addition.These vessels were produced at Saint-Cloud, the first major manufactory in France to makesoft-paste porcelain, part of Europe's attempts to imitate genuine Chinese or Japanese porcelain. The factory's success lay in its ability to produce attractive and reasonably priced alternatives to metalwork or true porcelain.
This elegantly attired sitter's identity is a mystery, but, in light of the painting's Florentine provenance, he was almost certainly a Florentine gentleman of high standing. He looks out toward the viewer and holds a letter, perhaps a note of introduction, in his left hand. His formal pose is reminiscent of antique statues, and a sense of movement is implied by the way his body twists to the left while his head turns to the right.Salviati effectively captured the different tactile qualities of the various fabrics: the green curtains have a velvety richness, and the gentleman's black silk vest is distinguished from its dark velvet trim and purple slashed silk sleeves. Individual strands of hair can be detected in the man's meticulously painted beard, mustache, and hair. The affected gesture, confident posture, and strident colors of this portrait are characteristic of mid-sixteenth century Mannerism.
In this highly polished chalk study,ManneristFrancesco Salviati combined tight, sure contours with subtle modeling to suggest the smoothness of the marble sculpture on which he based his rendition. He introduced white chalkhighlightsso economically that they are almost invisible, never interrupting the smooth light-to-dark gradations that shape his forms. Salviati based this drawing on theHerculesChiaramonti, aclassicalsculpture in theVaticanMuseums. To make a complete figure, he reconstructed parts missing from the damaged statue: the head, right forearm, and right leg below the knee. Salviati's talent made this inanimate, incomplete figure appear alive, animatedly twisting to gaze wide-eyed off the sheet.
In this very finishedpreparatory study,Christfloats above an unusual cast of saints, probably chosen by the donor because their names corresponded to those of his family.Saint John the Baptistcarries his signature staff with a cross at the far left. To his right, the penitentSaint Jeromebeats his chest with a stone. Herattribute, the spiked wheel that miraculously splintered apart, accompanies Saint Catherine, andSaint Thomaskneels, hands open in astonishment.For his refinedcomposition, Giuseppe Salviati employed elongated figures in exaggerated poses typical of theManneriststyle. Most striking is the study's lushness, which Salviati achieved through a fluid application of ink, wash, andbodycolorcombined across the blue paper. Contrasting the white bodycolor against both the colored paper and deep darks of his washes and ink created a dramaticchiaroscuro. His white washes also created decorative patterns on the saints' draperies and skin.Salviati made the drawing as a study for analtarpiece.
A sensualfaun, a spirit of the wilderness with goatlike features, tenderly holds a goat that he has placed upon a tree stump. From this stump hang the faun's musical instruments, which, like his goatlike features, associate him withPan, god of the pasture in ancient mythology, who loved music. The sculpture was inspired by two famousantiquestatues that the French artist Jacques-Francois Saly saw while studying in Rome:Faun with Kid,discovered in Rome in 1676 and now in the Prado, and theSatyrwith Grapes and a GoatfromHadrian's villa. Saly first made a plaster model of the faun, which he submitted to theAcadmie Royale de peinture et de sculpturein Paris as the first step for Academy membership. He was then asked to execute a marble version. Made specifically to impress and demonstrate his skill, this marbleFaun Holding a Goatis among the most exquisitely carved and carefully finished of Saly's works. On the basis of this sculpture, the Academy accepted Saly as a member in 1751.
Though cut off at the edge of thecomposition, Lucas Samaras's forearm is perfectly centered over the obscure silhouette of his upper body in this self-portrait, As if the artist-subject was trying to say,  Don't look at me!  Samaras denies the viewers the ability to familiarize themselves with his facial features and instead emphasizes his highly detailed hand, a vital tool for making art. Thus his hand takes the place of his face and becomes a symbol of himself.Samaras repeatedly focused attention on himself in his Photo-Transformations series. He often extensively altered these Polaroid self-portraits by manipulating the surface emulsions while they were fresh from the camera and still malleable.
What does Lucas Samaras reveal about himself in this Photo-Transformation  He created this self-portrait with a Polaroid camera, but he did not let the picture develop on its own. Samaras altered the print by manipulating the dyes, slightly obscuring his head and shoulders. The viewer's attention focuses on his gaping mouth, which suggests a long, desperate scream. Perhaps Samaras was trying to convey that he is frightened. Is he crying out in despair, or pain, or rage  Or is he crying out at all  This portrait seems to present more questions than answers, somewhat like the artist himself.
In this self-portrait, Lucas Samaras reaches out as if trapped in the photograph. In sharp contrast to the indistinctbackgroundof his upper body, his crisply defined fingers curl forward, as if he is searching for a way to transcend a two-dimensional world of his own creation. An overriding sense of claustrophobia defines this image, underscored by the small scale of the Polaroid print. Samaras, a hermit-like person, made many Polaroid self-portraits like this in the 1970s as a means of observing himself. The images are open to a wide range of interpretation. Here, Samaras may have tried to convey the sense of isolation he experiences as a reclusive person.
In this self-portrait Lucas Samaras explicitly portrays himself in both roles, as artist and as subject. On the left, he appears dressed and seated behind the camera, in the guise of an artist. In the center, as the subject, his distorted, naked body floats above a black-and-white checkerboard floor. A picture of a life-size skeletal human is the third figure in the composition. Samaras's self-portraits are psychologically complex images that challenge viewers and defy any single interpretation. One analysis of this image could be that Samaras is asking the audience to recognize him as an artist and as an individual concerned with both interior and exterior dimensions of mind, body, and soul.
As if engaging in a tug-of-war with himself, Lucas Samaras confronts and struggles with his own reflection in this self-portrait. The leg-less reflection is incomplete, however, giving the impression of a deformed adversary. A monochromatic polka-dotbackgroundand a vibrant green and red border act as a stage for this dramatic struggle.Samaras's Photo-Transformations, which he made in the 1970s as a means to examine various facets of himself, could be understood as visual manifestations of internal conflict. They are complex psychological investigations that, according to at least one critic, illustrate one person's efforts toward spiritual healing.
Submerged in narcissism, nothing remains . . . but  me and myself, I am my own audience, the other, contemplating my existence. Made in the 1970s as a means of studying himself, Lucas Samaras's photographs illustrate the internal struggle that can occur between conflicting aspects of one personality. Bent over a captain's chair, Samaras rests his head as if he is at the guillotine. Another blurry form hovers above, about to violently attack the submissive figure.Samaras made his Photo-Transformations, a series of self-portraits, with SX-70 Polaroid film. Still wet, the film's emulsions could be manipulated to alter the finished image. He used straight pins, rubber erasers, and other simple tools to  draw  into the developing surface. For this portrait, he created a diamond pattern over and around the dominant figure that underscores the frenzy of motion.
Sander grew up in Herdorf, a town in the Westerwald associated with mining and farming. In this family portrait, he is seated at far right. His wife, Anna, stands behind him.
Assembled outside a train station in rural Germany, these four railway workers posed for August Sander, who made this photograph in an effort to record the men's physiognomy. The neatly groomed workers stand awkwardly with their hands at their sides, wearing the uniforms of the railway company. Unfortunately for the tall worker on the far right, the sleeves of the standard garment were a bit too short. Railway companies in both America and Europe provided employment to many men who benefited from the innovation of the steam engine.
Identifying this figure as the  earthbound man,  Sander forged an implicit reference to the soil as a source of livelihood. The farmer's hands grasp the cane, which keeps him upright and connected to the earth.
Sander often extracted tightly cropped head shots from full-length portraits, creating a standardized format to contemplate different human types. Images such as this one of a peasant woman are reminiscent of ethnological photographs frequently executed in the late nineteenth century. However, instead of documenting people from faraway places, Sander's pictures reveal the physical features of the  tribes  of his native Germany.
A commissioned portrait, this photograph is an official record of two young men from Nistertal, Germany, documented without critical intent. According to Sander's typology, the men's physical condition immediately marks them as outcasts, representatives of a  late  stage of social evolution.
Sander's treatment of the German farmer reflects, in part, the country's dramatic transition from a mostly agricultural society to an urban, industrialized state. The family shown here--dressed in their Sunday outfits--may be on their way to or from church. By presenting new generations next to older ones, Sander showed how the past gives way to the future in never-ending cycles of renewal and regeneration.
This photograph of a rural couple on their wedding day reveals how Sander's subjects saw themselves, how they wanted to be seen by others, and how they wished this event to be preserved for posterity. The young man's slick, fashionable grooming and calculated pose betray a theatrical consciousness that is absent in his wife.
Sander often traveled from his Cologne studio to the villages of the Westerwald in search of new clients. In keeping with traditional representations of rural life, he focused on his subjects' rugged faces and plain appearances to convey a sense of natural strength and wisdom. Sander referred to this portrait of the shepherd Hermann Pithahn from the village of Giessenhausen as the  sage. 
The absence of a female figure in this poignant scene is conspicuous. Within a well-appointed domestic interior, two awkward boys gaze sullenly toward the viewer while their father, absorbed in thought, stares into the distance. Although no longer part of their lives, the mother is symbolically present through the palpable sorrow of the loved ones she has left behind.
Deeply influenced by the community and customs of his youth in the Westerwald, Sander applied the individual traits he observed in this region to a more universal human experience. The stiffness with which this couple present themselves belies a lifelong devotion that Sander associated with the attributes  propriety and harmony. 
 These people, whose way of life I had known from my youth, appealed to me because of their closeness to nature,  wrote August Sander of the farmers who were among his first subjects. These images belong to his photographic documentation of the German people, which he eventually called  People of the Twentieth Century.  Perhaps most striking about this portrait of three farmers walking along a country road on their way to a dance is their formal dress: each wears a hat and suit and carries a walking stick. This formal appearance removes them from the reality of their occupations. Each man is seen from the side, glancing over his shoulder at the photographer; they stop only for a moment before continuing on their journey.
The young musician stands holding his cello, with his bow poised as if playing. He looks directly at the photographer, posing proudly with his instrument, which fills the frame from top to bottom. Barely visible along the left edge of the photograph is the shoulder of another man eliminated by August Sander's cropping. In the full view of this image, the cellist stands with four other musicians. Their location outdoors suggests that the unidentified man may have been an itinerant musician, although with such a large instrument it is unlikely that he simply strolled the countryside. This working musician from the Siegerland iron-ore mining district of northwestern Germany was part of Sander's systematic documentation of German workers.
On a muddy roadside that reveals evidence of recent rain stand three children from a farming family with their dog and a toy horse. August Sander captured the familial relationship by focusing on the similarities in appearance and the intimacy of the grouping. The boy on the right, obviously the eldest, holds a toy whip erect like a staff, as though he already assumes his role as the leader of the group. Both of the older children position themselves as protective brothers to their infant sister, who sits in the carriage holding a doll. One brother rests his hand next to her on the carriage handle, while the other leans in toward her, possibly holding her hand behind the dog's head.
The calling to a life of spirituality represented one option of independence available to the modern woman. The heavy religious garb worn by this nun appears restrictive, but her benevolent demeanor reveals an autonomy that resists conventional female stereotypes.
Willi Bongard (German, 1900-possibly 1985) first met Sander through his association with the artists known as the Cologne Progressives. Sander owned a number of the young artist's woodcuts. Captured in profile, his curly locks and freckles accentuating his youth, Bongard seems disengaged from the camera and, by extension, the viewer.
The Cologne-based Franz Maria Jansen (German, 1885-1958) wrote the 1918 manifestoAbout Expressionism, which encouraged artists to embrace activism and the subjects of modern life. Committed to social and political subjects, he was a member of the German Association of Artists. He exhibited widely until the National Socialists confiscated most of his works from museums.
Gustinus Ambrosi (Austrian, 1893-1975) was a sculptor and poet who, despite going deaf at the age of seven, created more than two thousand sculptures in bronze and stone. Working primarily in Vienna, Ambrosi sculpted busts of notable figures throughout Europe, including Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.
As a student at the Dresden School of Arts and Crafts, Otto Dix (German, 1891-1969) painted portraits of local residents in a realistic style. Following his experience as a soldier during World War I, he shifted his attention to themes of violence and death. Dix and Sander were key figures in the New Objectivity movement. The visual sobriety that both men sought in their work is embodied in this portrait.
Founded in the early 1920s by Gustav Havemann (German, 1882-1960), the Havemann String Quartet performed both classical and modern music, some of it considered avant-garde. When the Third Reich imposed a ban on what they considered  degenerate  music, Havemann (at far right) was expelled from the national musicians' club because he had intervened on behalf of composer Paul Hindemith.
In this family portrait featuring publisher Otto Schmidt and his sisters, each of the four siblings conveys a sense of individuality while still appearing connected to the others. On the left, a shy, bespectacled girl avoids gazing directly into the camera's lens. As a result, the viewer sees only her blushing profile. A sister sits behind her, on a higher seat that emphasizes her status as the eldest. In the front, a confident sister looks directly into the camera. On the right, their brother leans in, as if trying to assert himself. They all wear modest, conservative attire, appropriate for this middle-class family.August Sander posed the sitters in a compositionally balanced way that underscored their familial ties. He specifically avoided seating the brother in center or the rear, which would have determined his role as the family patriarch.
Gottfried Brockmann (German, 1903-1983) was a member of the Cologne Progressives. His work is characterized by Surrealistic actors, puppets, and figurines. Portrayed standing before a canvas in a painter's smock with his hair freshly shorn, Brockmann conjures the archetypal artist persona. His far-off gaze lends him an ambiguity similar to that of the subjects in his own paintings.
Paul Hindemith (German, 1895-1963) was associated with the concept ofGebrauchsmusik, or  utility music  composed for a specific purpose such as a historical event. Sander captured the composer as deeply reticent and introverted. Despite his calm expression, Hindemith was publicly denounced by Germany's minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, as an  atonal noisemaker. 
Sander alluded to his sitter's physical and inner strength by attributing the qualities of the  fighter or revolutionary  to this farmer, who looks out squarely with an uncompromising gaze.
Included in the portfolio of farming types, this formally dressed, amply proportioned couple represents a much more affluent segment of agrarian society than the modest farmhands who actually worked the land. Translated as the  lord of the manor  in Sander's 1929 publicationFace of the Time, the caption further set them apart.
Not far from his birthplace in the Westerwald, August Sander made this portrait of two nearly identical sisters. Wearing matching, plain, dark dresses--an attire typical of rural women--they may be on their way to a confirmation ceremony. Despite their similarities, these sisters possess very different characteristics. The sister on the left is smaller and probably younger than the one whose hand she is holding. Her features are more refined, and her strapped shoes certainly convey a more feminine character.These two sisters reflect the  country type  in society, which Sander considered a fundamental part of German civilization. He traveled around the Westerwald a great deal, making pictures of people who fit this  type.  Sander published this image inFace of Our Time, an early version of his ambitious project,  People of the Twentieth Century. 
This photograph of three boys was typical of Sander's commercial practice. Originally created as an object to exchange with family members or insert in an album, the small-format postcard intensifies personal contact with the solemn young subjects, whose dark clothing blends with the dense foliage in the background.
As the daughter of August Sander, Sigrid Sander came into contact with photography at a very early age. Although she was assuredly familiar with her father's photography studio and darkroom, she nonetheless looks most uncomfortable as the subject of this portrait, which was taken on her confirmation day at the age of fifteen. Sigrid stands awkwardly with her arms hanging at her side, devoid of expression. Both her dress and hairstyle indicate a conservative nature, while her posture communicates a feeling that she is less than relaxed and confident.
Unlike his images of white-collar professionals that often display individuals in nondescript settings, August Sander's images of laborers explore their visceral connection to working environments and tools of trade. In this photograph, two blacksmiths grasp their hammers while standing in front of an anvil; for Sander, they embodied the pre-industrial craftsman, whom he held in the highest esteem. Sander's unsentimental style of documentation captured the confidence with which these men return the photographer's gaze.
Sander's eldest son, Erich, is the figure at far left in this group. A philosophy student and member of the Communist Party, he introduced his father to a wide range of political figures until he was imprisoned by the National Socialists in 1934. That same year, the remaining copies of Sander'sFace of the Timewere confiscated, and the printing plates were destroyed. Erich died in prison ten years later, shortly before he was to be released.
In contrast to the mature Ada Riphahn, Dora Lttgen, the wife of Cologne-based architect Hanz Heinz Lttgen, appears tentative as she sits in profile on the edge of a table. Sander's composition carefully juxtaposes her plaid dress with the angular wall pattern to enliven her reserved expression.
Seated front and center in this portrait of adolescent girls is Sigrid Sander, the daughter of photographer August Sander. Looking directly into the camera's lens, Sigrid reveals that she is well versed in her father's straightforward approach to portraiture. The vacuous stares of many of the other girls render this a document that declines to offer insight into their personalities. In making this photograph, Sander's purpose may have been to record the girls' physiognomy for his unfinished survey of German  types. Eventually, Sigrid worked behind the camera, trained by her father to follow in his footsteps. Sander's portraits of women demonstrate that, like many of his contemporaries, he often associated them with the typical roles of mother, sister, and wife. He made an exception of his own daughter, whom he held in high esteem and in whom he frequently confided. Unfortunately, Sander could be a strict taskmaster, and Sigrid could not abide his relentless supervision. She soon abandoned photography and later became a potter.
Dominated by an extraordinary moustache that defies gravity as it hovers over his mouth, the police sergeant stands erect and centered in the frame, his left hand holding the handle of an ornamental weapon. Identified only by his occupation in the title, he resists becoming merely a type by means of his distinctive facial hair and the wedding band on his finger.
Karl August Wittfogel (German, 1896-1988) wrote about Chinese history and culture. He joined the Communist Party in 1920 and worked from 1925 to 1933 at the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, where he became immersed in Marxist studies. An outspoken critic of Fascism, Wittfogel was imprisoned by the National Socialists and later released following international protest.
Attired in a kind of occupational costume--stylish trousers befitting an artist's wife--Frau Peter Abelen stands in a gallery surrounded by her husband's paintings. Secured between her teeth is a cigarette that she is about to light: in her hands are the match and striker. Wearing a shirt and tie and slicked-back hair, she presents an androgynous figure. Her animated expression, unusual for an August Sander portrait, falls somewhere between bravado and agitation. Her left foot is poised as though she has been stopped in mid-stride, and the blur of her feet seems to reinforce this effect.
Surely this small child is not the navigator of the bicycle upon which he perches, clutching the handlebars as if ready to ride. He has been placed not on the driver's seat but on a folded cushion on the support bar so that he can reach the handles to steady himself. The dog seated alongside the bike obscures the kickstand that must have been keeping the bike from toppling its tiny passenger. Both child and dog look intensely at the photographer with serious expressions; the overall effect is both playful and ominous in the incongruity of sizes and roles presented by the various elements.
After nearly thirty years of creating sweet-looking, posed studio portraits, August Sander declared:  From now on I only want the honest truth about our time and people.  This image illustrates the direction in which his style would develop.Posed in her stained apron, this cleaning woman clutches a broom with such determination that it is difficult to imagine her without this tool. Her firmly set jaw and stern expression convey a lifetime of struggle. At her neck, the safety pin she has used to fasten her dress underscores the extent of her hardship.Sander's portrait, much like Dorothea Lange's powerful image,Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California, is a poignant reminder of the inner strength some individuals are able to call upon in times of distress and deprivation.
An androgynous young man holds a cigarette in his right hand, his left tucked nonchalantly into the flap pocket of his diamond-patterned suit jacket. His fine, sharply drawn features, carefully shaped eyebrows, narrow shoulders, and the slightly sensuous thrust of his hip seem somewhat inconsonant with the masculine tweed of his suit. Identified only as a student, he stands against a plain white backdrop, with his intellectual pursuits stated in the title rather than suggested in this elegant and striking portrait.
Consisting of as many as fifty woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments, the Cologne Wind Ensemble performed classical concerts and popular tunes. Sander granted bassoonist Bernhard Hhnerfrst noble stature by isolating him from the ensemble. In contrast to the musician's solid physique, his luminous bassoon takes on a delicate character of its own.
Anticipating Germany's economic decline, Sander poignantly ended his bookFace of the Timewith a picture of an unemployed man loitering on a street corner. With shaved head and torn clothing, he has lost all attributes of honor and social respectability.
Exhibiting a staged formality, an accordionist and a fiddler  perform  in a courtyard while a young woman listens from a second-floor window. Sander's photograph condenses time by removing the accidental or spontaneous dimensions from the scene.
Sander's images of the growing white-collar work-force, though not literally displaying the emblems of their professions, reveal details about the subjects' status in society. Impeccably groomed, this industrialist, Max Spindler of Wuppertal, sits inside a darkened office with his fingers delicately arranged in a triangular formation. His textured suit and tie blend with the richness of the office interior, amplifying his assertive countenance.
One of the few subjects in Sander's bookFace of the Timewhose identity is partially revealed, Hans Poelzig (German, 1869-1936) became an influential member of the German Work Federation. This association of architects, designers, and industrialists attempted to combine traditional crafts with modern mass-production techniques. Poelzig is best known for his redesign of Berlin's Grand Theater (now destroyed), an auditorium with red walls and stallactite-like columns. His trademark hairstyle and horn-rimmed glasses distinguish him as both idiosyncratic and intellectual.
Businessman and parliamentarian Johannes Scheerer was one of the many individuals at the fringes of the political spectrum. He shoulders his umbrella like a shotgun, measuring up the viewer with an owlish, suspicious glance. Behind this formidable facade lurks a character more akin to a provinical schoolmaster than a legislator.
Included in the portfolio devoted to educators, this clergyman demonstrates some of the religious values prescribed by the modern German school system. Cloaked in formal garments, he echoes the rigidity of his young students, who stand obediently in crisp uniforms.
Dr. A. Herbig, Jr., and his wife pose with their heads slightly tilted towards each other in this portrait by August Sander. While calmly gazing into the camera lens, their hands rest in their laps. Young, attractive, and well-dressed, the couple was among those chosen by Sander for inclusion in his comprehensive documentary project,  People of the Twentieth Century,  which illustrated a select view of German society. This portrait depicts the dignity and composure associated with the middle-class, while revealing a sense of stability much sought after by Germans between World Wars I and II.
Following World War I, the downtrodden and maimed attracted the attention of many avant-garde artists. Economic crises proliferated. In this photograph, Sander focused on a beggar couple from the town of Neuwied, depicting them in the street, their habitual terrain. By observing impassively, he uncovered their bitterness and shame.
Identified within the context of Sander'sPeople of the Twentieth Centuryproject with the generic title  functionary  (one who holds a position in a government or political party), this sitter, Jean Winterich, was a member of the Communist Party.
In reality his head is a calculator, his arms respectively a pencil and a pen stand, his legs two rulers, and his body a ledger . . .Written in 1923, this disparaging quote evinces one author's view of institutional staff members such as the savings bank cashier in this portrait. The emergence of a white-collar workforce in Germany during the 1920s vastly expanded opportunities for such new types of salaried employees as the bookkeeper, the bureaucrat, the secretary. Although rising employment rates were a positive development, Germany's volatile financial market during this period often meant that jobs were insecure.August Sander intended this image of a stern bank clerk to be part of his portfolio entitled  The Official.  The monumental cash register and the note in his hand inform the viewer of this man's monotonous role. Interestingly, only a few years before this picture was made, the value of German currency was so low that many people preferred to trade their Deutschmarks for American dollars, rather than to deposit them in a bank.
After studying music in Vienna, Leonardo Aramesco (Romanian, 1898-1946) became a well-known tenor in Cologne and also produced songs for radio. In this image, Aramesco literally performs before Sander's lens, as evidenced through the exaggerated position of his hands, shock of dark hair, and melodramatic gaze.
Educated in Cologne and Hannover, Hans Walter Reitz (German, 1888-1955) was a practitioner of the  new architecture  who worked primarily on residential projects. In this portrait, the careful construction of Reitz's fingertips alludes to the exactitude required of his profession.
August Sander, whose systematic documentation of the German people included manual laborers, captured this unshaven coal carrier stepping out of a building with his burden slung over his shoulder. According to Sander's hierarchical theory, the laborer's place was on the lower rungs of society. By photographing his subject emerging from a dark basement, Sander underscored his theory quite literally.In this image, the doorway framing the laborer sets a boundary between the bright light of day and the shadowy depths behind him. The man's bent leg, which seems to propel him forward, lends dynamism to a composition that might otherwise have been static.
We can tell from appearance the work someone does or does not do; we can read in his face whether he is happy or troubled, for life unavoidably leaves its trace there.August Sander professed his belief in physiognomy in a 1931 radio lecture; however, he still chose to photograph this taxi driver at the wheel of his cab, visually linking the man and his profession. Sander also made many portraits of workers in his studio, without the tools of their trade to act as props or visual clues to their profession.The original image was not so tightly arranged. Sander isolated and enlarged this detail from the original composition. One historian has noted the evocative relationship of the man's body to the space surrounding it:  By tightly inscribing his subject into the frame of his vehicle, Sander creates an image of almost claustrophobic intensity. It is suggestive, perhaps, of the driver's entrapment in a narrow, limited world. 
In this image [Sander] lends his subjects a surprisingly inoffensive air, thus distracting from any mutinous ambitions they might harbor.August Sander usually photographed industrial workers in a way that obscured their role within the German economy. When photographing these dockworkers, he also obscured the subjects' role in German politics. Working conditions in naval yards were known to be quite poor and gave rise to numerous militant uprisings; in this group image, however, each man maintains a dignified posture, a stance no doubt derived from occupational pride.Lined up shoulder-to-shoulder with their hands stuffed in their pockets, these dockworkers form an imposing barricade to the entrance of what is probably a waterfront warehouse. A foreman in white shirt and black vest stands in the front row flanked by workers in the scruffy, striped shirts that signal their place in the labor hierarchy.
Sander placed this portrait of Raoul Hausmann (German, 1886-1971) in his portfolio of technicians and inventors to conclude the section on skilled tradesmen inPeople of the Twentieth Century. Hausmann was the cofounder of Dada in Berlin, an art movement based on deliberate irrationality and the rejection of tradition. Sander might also have chosen to place Hausmann in the section on artists, but the categories he created--architect, sculptor, painter--did not accommodate the inventiveness of Hausmann's work: photo collage, sound poems, and other forms of expression that embraced new technologies.
In this image of seven dancers, August Sander filled the frame with women posed in the familiar chorus-line arrangement. The bold stripes on their trouser legs echo the heavy theater curtain, providing a strong compositional element. Sander made images of people from all walks of life for his photographic project,  People of the Twentieth Century,  to which this picture belongs.
Founded by director and producer Erwin Piscator, the Piscator theater company in Berlin was known for revolutionary performances that stressed sociopolitical over emotional content. The use of onstage projections, mechanical devices, documentary material, and other modern media made productions more engaging to contemporary audiences. Despite the rigid appearance of the members assembled here, the theater endorsed radical experimentation with new forms of German drama.
In this stark portrait the Socialist leader Paul Frhlich stands in the center of the image, facing directly forward with a serious expression. His hands, half-balled into fists, give the impression of an uncompromising man, but they may also indicate some discomfort at having his portrait made. Frhlich focused his penetrating gaze on the photographer, who was positioned slightly above the camera. His softly wrinkled three-piece suit tempers his rigid comportment.
It is very interesting to talk to these people: one learns a great deal about their circumstances and the deeper meaning of their lives.August Sander's sympathetic view of circus people and gypsies and his genuine love of children are embodied in this image. Rather than positioning the girl in front of the caravan wagon, he had her remain sheltered, holding a key in a locked door. Lace-edged window curtains reflect an attempt to make this roaming wagon--probably the only home this girl has ever known--a comfortable environment. Behind her is a mysterious world, not to be revealed to the viewer. As one historian has remarked,  a suggestive, almost tantalizing narrative unfolds: of freedom and confinement, security and danger, things visible and hidden. 
These two young girls linked arms for their portrait, expressing their close relationship quite literally. While the girl on the left is more fashionably dressed and neat in appearance, her downcast eyes convey a sense of reluctance and shyness. In contrast, the girl on the right, while unkempt, appears more bold and confident. August Sander created an evocative and poignant image that clearly illustrates the girls' personalities and closeness through their posture, despite the fact that their sightless eyes do not meet the camera.Sander made this picture at a home for the blind. He intended the portrait to be part of his comprehensive survey,  People of the Twentieth Century,  which illustrated German archetypes such as tradespeople, farmers, and politicians. He categorized disabled people along with the ill and the insane as  The Last People. 
Two oddly paired men sit on a bench in a park-like setting: one holds his glasses while the other rests his hand against the edge of the seat. The men bear no resemblance to each other--the young man on the left is fair; his older companion on the right is tanned--but they are united by their common blindness.August Sander made this portrait at a home for the blind in Dren, just west of Cologne. The younger man on the left was apparently of sincere interest to Sander, who made a detailed enlargement of him, entitledBlind Man, Congenitally Afflicted.
August Sander's studio provided a bare setting for this young girl, whose plaid and striped ensemble implies a lively attitude. She stands expressionless, with her hands nervously raised at her waist.Sander's straightforward approach to portraiture was informed by his interest in physiognomy. His motivation for making this portrait was to capture the girl's facial features, which he believed would reveal something of her inner character and temperament. He made this picture as part of an archive he created to represent German civilization. He arranged the archive according to a theory of cultural development that placed individuals closely connection to nature--such as farmers--first, followed by  The Working Man,   The Professions,   The Artists,  and so on.
August Sander made this enlarged portrait of a young man from his negative forInmates of a Home for the Blind. He deeply believed that the physiognomy of an individual revealed their character. Although this man's downcast eyes fail to make contact with the camera, the portrait's close-up view implies an almost intimate sense of connection between the subject and viewer. The clarity of Sander's original negative was so superior that this portrait retains fine details such as the man's watery eyes.Sander intended this portrait to be part of his comprehensive survey,  People of the Twentieth Century,  which illustrated German archetypes such as tradespeople, farmers, and politicians. In his hierarchy of types, the disabled, ill, and insane were literally referred to as  The Last People. 
Hidden behind dark glasses, the subject of this portrait fails to convey any sense of emotion, either to the photographer August Sander or to the viewer. To Sander, who believed that physiognomy equated character, this subject's disfigurement defined her entirely and was the primary motive inspiring him to shoot the photograph.The fact that neither Sander nor the viewer can make eye contact with the subject underscores her status as a social outcast. Sander's many portraits of marginalized citizens--the mentally ill, the blind, the maimed--were made for his portfolio entitled  The Last People,  which was part of a series illustrating the physiognomy of the German people.
The carnival performer leans against a trailer wearing a printed robe that falls open over her fringe- and bead-encrusted costume. Her worn and harshly painted face, tousled hair, slouched posture, and wrinkled pants suggest either a long day of work or a hard night. She looks at the photographer with a mixture of exhaustion and a slight, knowing amusement. With her right hand she gingerly holds the end of one row of beads--an almost unconscious, graceful gesture that softens the flashy display of flesh and fancy details that mark her working garb.
Two men sit in front of a chain-link fence. Is it imprisoning them, or protecting them  Which side of the fence are they on Seated on a park-like bench, a stout gentleman puffs on his pipe, his round belly protruding from beneath a partially unbuttoned overcoat. To his right, a second gentleman sits calmly, holding his hat in his lap and leaning his cane against his left leg. Perhaps they have been engaged in conversation, pausing long enough for August Sander to make this portrait while visiting a home for the blind. These men probably lost their vision during World War I.Sander made this picture as part of an archive he created to represent German civilization. He arranged the archive according to a theory of cultural development that placed individuals close to nature--such as farmers--first, followed by  The Working Man,   The Professions,   The Artists,  and so on. This portrait would have been categorized in  The Last People,  images of the ill, disabled, and insane.
This self-possessed figure is Madame Lingens, the Sander children's French tutor. The extravagant gown and jewelry express her conscientiousness before the camera. She demonstrates a shrewd awareness of her femininity and individuality.
August Sander made this portrait of architect Hans Lttgen and his unknown companion at a Mardi Gras carnival in Cologne. Sander was one of many commercial photographers hired by artists to photograph their parties. He eventually developed close friendships with members of the Cologne art circle, whose intellectual discussions about art and politics he greatly enjoyed. Sander benefited from their comments about his work, and his home contained many of their paintings, which he obtained through trades for his photographs.
Perhaps the hands of this masquerading gentleman are blurry because he is busily snapping his fingers to the beat of music. With his mouth partially open, he appears to be singing as well. Who is this playful character August Sander made this picture of Heinrich Hoerle, a painter, at a Mardi Gras carnival. For three days in February, the people of Cologne traditionally celebrated Mardi Gras with daytime parades and evening masquerade parties. Sander was one of many commercial photographers hired to make photographs at these parties.Sander developed close friendships with many members of the Cologne art circle. He enjoyed their intellectual discussions about art and politics, and benefited from their comments about his work. Sander's home contained many paintings by these artists, which he obtained through trades for his photographs.
At the approach of World War II, August Sander sensed the forthcoming destruction that would lay waste to his home in Cologne, seen here. He ensured the safety of his family by moving them to the small village of Kuchhausen in the Westerwald. Before the move however, he systematically documented each room of his home and work space, including this drying corner and enlarger in his studio. The album he created was all that remained after an air raid by Allied forces demolished Sander's Cologne apartment in 1944.
Sander's studio provided the bare backdrop for this young socialite, Miss Bausch. With legs crossed and hands folded daintily, she personifies the outward flair and sophistication of Weimar elegance. Her genteel body language and feminine outfit exemplify standards of beauty and propriety that informed Sander's classification of women.
Two circus usherettes in uniforms and pillbox hats pose with their programs for the Circus Barum. Although the woman on the left appears rather stiff, she still conveys a sense of great confidence. Her associate seems quite comfortable, resting her weight on her right leg with one hand on her hip, while holding a folded program in the other hand. To achieve this artfully balanced composition, August Sander positioned the women so that their decorated uniforms would complement the two-toned backdrop. Similarly, the usherettes' white socks and programs echo the wagon's lighter tone at the top of the image.Sander made many pictures of the circus performers, gypsies, peddlers, and tramps that moved in and out of city streets and fairgrounds. He believed that these vagabonds were disappearing from society and wanted to capture images of their 'type' before that occurred. In his hierarchical view, these  Traveling Types  represented a marginalized element of urban life.
Group portraits were another aspect of Sander's commercial pursuits. Situated outdoors by railroad tracks, a twelve-man marching band lines up in full regalia. The clarity of Sander's photographic technique reinforces the appearance of absolute synchronicity.
Ada Riphahn, the wife of Wilhelm Riphahn, who designed the Cologne Opera House, radiates a confidence appropriate to her age and social standing. The plush velvet chair, feathery dog at her side, and shimmering blouse are balanced by the strong lines of the drapery to create a richly textured portrait.
Photographed during the most unstable period of the Weimar Republic, this man is a deputy of one of the numerous political factions that emerged as support for Hitler increased. Although Sander knew the names and party affiliations of the various politicians, he conveyed a sense of neutrality with his titles.
Packed tightly within the frame of the photograph, a group of rowdy masqueraders is having a good time. The standing figures wrap their arms around each other while the seated individuals are nearly lying on top of one another. Their smiles and camaraderie seem sincere. August Sander made this portrait of his artist friends during the Mardi Gras carnival that was celebrated every February in Cologne.Though he was a generation older than most of the artists in the Cologne art circle, Sander developed a close friendship with many of them. He enjoyed their intellectual discussions about art and politics and benefited from their comments about his work. Sander exhibited his photographs in their shows, and his home contained many of their paintings, which he obtained through trades for his photographs.
The German economy fluctuated dramatically during the Weimar Republic, causing the banking system to dissolve so rapidly that by 1932 more than six million Germans were unemployed. The self-assured manner of this bank official leaves little trace of the desperate financial situation that made the promises of the National Socialists so tempting.
Sander's images of skilled tradesmen often explore the subjects' connection to their working environments. Framed by the chimney he is building, this mason embodies the craftsman of the preindustrial era. He holds his tools effortlessly, as though they are extensions of his hands.
Sander's mussed hair and crumpled suit reveal his slightly dazed state. Probably taken by one of his assistants, this portrait represents his humorous, approachable side. Rather than residing in the artists' section of hisPeople of the Twentieth Century, this portrait of Sander, who considered himself a city type, is found in the context of service professionals.
Sander created this image of an SS officer posing among his cohorts. Some men appear in brown uniforms and red armbands, while others, including women, wear swastikas on lapel buttons and caps.
This image was made at Cologne's central train station, with the neo-Gothic cathedral as a backdrop. Like many of his fellow countrymen, Sander may not have realized what horrendous crimes the National Socialists were committing. He photographed the SS chief as if the man were just another specimen in his typological catalogue.
In this self-portrait, August Sander, at around the age of sixty-five, enjoys one of his favorite activities, playing the lute. Aside from being a successful photographer, Sander was also an accomplished musician--he once even considered a career as a concert lute player. Sander valued the rural life and the communal ideals of pre-industrial Germany; thus it is not surprising to find that his repertoire was made up mostly of German folk songs. Nor is it surprising to learn that music was vital in the Sander household. All of the children were given extensive musical training. His eldest son and daughter played the guitar, while his youngest son was an accomplished cellist. Sander often played for friends in the Cologne art circle, who would come over in the evenings to enjoy his homemade rhubarb wine.This self-portrait also depicts Sander's library. Though not formally educated, he read voraciously, and was especially interested in the works of Goethe, Schiller, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, as well as Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann. By surrounding himself with signifiers of erudition, Sander presented himself as a learned individual and illustrated for modern viewers his veneration of high German culture.
August Sander traveled the German countryside photographing the people he encountered, creating a document of the German people in the first half of the twentieth century. In this print he presented a small, tow-headed toddler standing in a lush wood in the mountainous Westerwald region of western Germany. The boy's tiny booted feet are partially sunk in the dense foliage that threatens to envelop his small body, but the child faces the camera defensively, wearing a serious expression and already assuming the posture of a man.
Upon relocating to the Westerwald toward the end of World War II, Sander returned to printing from existing negatives and continued to make photographs for his expansive social inventory of Germany. This portrait of a farmhand was taken during that later stage of his career, demonstrating the continuity of his project in both theory and practice.
In this idyllic image of Frau Steinrcke with her child and small dog, August Sander depicted a scene of leisure specifically associated with middle-class Weimar Germany. Seated on the grass, the baby smiles at the camera while the mother gazes contentedly and the dog stands proudly beside her. The absent father is presumably at work.One scholar astutely observed that, although  Sander claimed that his photographs were primarily documentary, . . . they also inevitably articulated anxieties and desires shared by many of his contemporaries.  Germany in the mid-1920s experienced political and economic chaos. By posing a woman with her child in a landscape, Sander emphasized women's domestic role and tie to nature rather than their increasing political and wage-earning power. Perhaps because it reinforces traditional social tenets, this portrait conveys a sense of stability and calm, despite the fact that it was made during a period of fragmentation and turmoil.
Gottfried Brockmann, a young painter associated with a group of artists known as the Cologne Progressives, leans forward with his head slightly tilted. The feminine manner in which he holds his cigarette and crosses his legs breaks all traditional rules of masculinity. August Sander's portrait of the artist he called a bohemian suggests that gender roles in Weimar society may have been far more fluid and complex than even he imagined.August Sander was a close friend to many of the young artists in Cologne, frequently showing his photographs in their exhibitions, or trading his images for their paintings. Indeed, Brockmann lived with Sander's family for almost two years, during which time they had numerous discussions about the political, social, and aesthetic concerns of the day.
Ingeborg vom Rath, a sculptor, leans forward as if she were attentively listening to someone outside the photograph's frame. Her vacant expression, however, suggests that she is engaged in thought or daydreaming.August Sander began acquainting himself with Cologne's art circle in the early 1920s, and he photographed many painters, sculptors, and architects. Many of his artist portraits contain samples of the subject's work; this example is rather unusual in that it does not include any of vom Rath's sculpture. Believing that an individual's face  portrayed not just the person's inner character, but also his trade, economic experience, and social position,  Sander probably felt that he could convey vom Rath's identity as an artist without representing her work. She appears to have been an assertive woman, and the prominent position of her hands-the tools of her trade- strongly hint at her occupation.
Posed in a chair with a book-perhaps the Bible-in her lap, this elderly woman represents what August Sander referred to as the  Earthbound Woman.  As a farmer's widow, her life was inextricably linked to the earth and its bounty. Sander made this portrait before World War I, when a romantic notion of human ties to nature pervaded most German minds. To Sander, peasant farmers represented the foundation of German civilization. In later years, he came to see this  type  of humanity as endangered by increased urbanization.
A fashionably dressed womanpersonifyingSeptember visits a market and chooses some figs from among the abundant fruits and vegetables displayed on a table. A scale hangs on the wall behind, while through an archway hunters shoot a herd of deer in a distant landscape. Joachim von Sandrart executed the drawing in a richly handled combination of chalk andwash, which evokes the range of textures of an oil painting, from the transparent layers of the woman's toile collar to the varied textures of the produce.Sandrart made this finished drawing after one of his own paintings, from a series ofallegoricalpersonifications of the months thatElectorMaximilian I of Bavaria commissioned for the dining hall of his palace near Munich. The reputation of the paintings began to spread in 1644 with the publication of a Dutch poem describing them. Sandrart then made a series of finished drawings to be used as models for a corresponding series of prints. Such engraved reproductions of paintings allowed many to enjoy and study what would otherwise have been the exclusive property of one man.
Amidst swirling draperies, Saint Joseph holds the infant Jesus upon a tasseled cushion. Joseph is modeled with subtle twists in his body, amplified by his buoyant and billowing tunic and cloak. Even his curly hair flutters with a life of its own. Fashioned from white-bodied earthenware, known as creamware, the figures are painted with lustrous jewel-like colors. Their theatricality is characteristic of Baroque sculpture.Athough most depictions present Saint Joseph as elderly, he is portrayed here as a youthful and handsome father. Inspired by the new focus on Jesus' human and family life and encouraged by the philosophies of the Counter-Reformation, the cult of Saint Joseph became more popular in the second half of the 1700s, when this sculpture was made.The subject and composition of this work are identical to those of a life-size marble of 1790 to 1791 by the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino in the Taranto Cathedral. Sanmartino produced a number of terracotta sketches for his large-scale sculpture; this small-scale ceramic group by Gennaro Laudato probably copied one of these and was intended as a collector's object or devotional piece.
On a circular base with swirls indicating waves, an elegantly coiffed, nude Venus looks down at Cupid while striding forward. Cupid sports wings and a bow and arrows in a sling over his back. Reaching up to his mother, he balances on a fantastic diving dolphin that has an almost human face. The figure of Venus is a study in contrasts: her elaborate hairstyle contrasts with her smooth flesh, and the detachment with which she takes away Cupid's arrow, now missing, disguises her passionate nature. Scenes like this one, drawn from Greek and Roman mythology, were popular in the 1600s and 1700s in France. By representing classical subjects, patrons and artists could justify depictions of the female nude and titillating images of amorous activity. Unusual holes left from the casting process in the top of Venus's head, in her right hand, and on the bottom of her feet may have been used to remove the core material. These holes may not have been visible from the work's original position and so were not disguised.
Riding his winged horse Pegasos, the Greek hero Bellerophon slays the monstrous Chimaera on this gold ring. A South Italian goldsmith constructed the elaborate box bezel from sheet gold and decorated it with gold floral filigree on all sides. He made the repouss scene of Bellerophon separately and attached it to the bezel as an appliqu. Using a link of a gold chain for the ring's hoop, he masked the join of the hoop and bezel with palmettes.Box bezel rings are rare, and this example is unique in its rendering of a complex mythological scene on the bezel. The theme of Bellerophon and the Chimaera may have been adapted from vases. It was a popular motif among South Italian vase-painters in the later 300s B.C.
Numerous gesticulating figures surround the resurrected body of Christ as he floats in the sky, his eyes raised to heaven and a large banner in his hands. At the center rear, an angel has opened the door of the tomb, while the soldiers who were meant to guard it recline or reach fruitlessly towards Christ, who is surrounded by rejoicing angels. Under an arched gate in the rear stand the small figures of two holy women.In this early design, one of several studies, Santi di Tito established the essential components of his composition for an altarpiece for the Medici chapel in a Florentine church. Only minor details changed as the final form of the altarpiece developed. The artist first sketched the scene in black chalk and then reworked the images in pen and ink. He left several visiblepentimenti, notably in the positioning of Christ's legs
Perched on a high ledge, the allegorical figure of papal authority holds up the keys to the church in one hand while clutching a notebook and quill pen in the other. Seen from below, her open-necked blouse exposes her broad, fleshy neck and powerful hands, while her skirt is drawn back enough to show her toes in a sandal. In the upper right, Carlo Saraceni experimented with a different arrangement for the folds of her dress.Saraceni produced this study for an allegorical figure in a fresco in a Roman palazzo. In the fresco she wears a more elaborate costume than the one in the drawing, suggesting that he based the drawing on a studio model. Artists in the Renaissance commonly used  live models as they tested out various positions in preparatory drawings. Later, they added decorative details and changed the clothing. Saraceni chose the drapery arrangement of the upper right for the final fresco.
Lost in thought, an old woman sits quietly, resting her feet on a bucket. A large cloak trimmed with fur surrounds her body, so that only her head, hunched shoulders, and large feet in their wooden shoes remain uncovered. A broad hat shelters her face, seen only in sharp profile. Roelandt Savery concentrated on broadly outlining the figure's position and the folds of fabric that obscure her body. He ignored more minute details such as the design of her hat or the form of her stool, suggesting only the general form of each.This drawing comes from a series of studies similar in subject and style. On many of the sheets, although not this one, the artist inscribed the wordsnaer het leven, which may suggest that each scene was drawn from life rather than from the artist's imagination. At a time when most drawings were prepared in the studio, this fact was unusual enough to be worth noting. The notations surrounding the figure suggest possible colors, perhaps for use in a painting.
A bearded old man squats on the ground, his body enveloped in a large cape. Tufts of hair stick out from under a cap, which is pulled low over his forehead, while a broad-brimmed hat lies beside him on the ground. The man's right foot ends abruptly in a bandaged stump resting in front of him; his other foot is tucked behind. Roelandt Savery emphasized the cloak's volume and shape using a system of cross-hatching with short, hooked strokes of the pen.This drawing comes from a series of studies similar in subject and style.

Transforming the theme of the temptation of Saint Anthony into a celebration of nature's magnificence, Flemish landscape and still life painter Roelandt Savery depicted the hermit Anthony reading a Bible--oblivious to the antics of numerous fantastic demons--while seated in a rustic cell. His wooden hut is nestled in a majestic and thickly wooded alpine wilderness, the true subject of Savery's painting.
The waterfall, the elaborate rock formation, and the remains of a round temple in the distance--these elements all recur throughout Roelandt Savery's work. In the tradition of Gillis van Coninxloo, Savery believed that nature was more than merely a backdrop to human action; it could be the dramatic focus of a picture.Roelandt Savery probably drew this setting from his imagination, based on places he had seen on his travels in the Tyrol, a mountainous region in Austria and Italy. During the early 1600s, while in the service of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague, Savery traveled extensively in the eastern Alps, gathering many of themotifshe would use in his pictures for the rest of his life. Savery made his early travel drawings using the same materials he often combined, the black chalk and colored wash seen in this drawing.
The large figure of a shepherd sits before a darkening blue sky with a wide-brimmed hat shading his eyes. Resting his left arm on a staff, he holds a flute in his hand. With his right hand he gestures towards the rustic scene of a farmhouse partially obscured by ancient ruins looming behind.The shepherd's face seems to be a realistic portrait, and Giovanni Gerolamo Savoldo's detailed treatment of his clothing indicates how closely Savoldo studied his model. Whether the painting depicts a specific person is unclear. More probably, the musical shepherd was meant to idealize and celebrate the charms of pastoral life for a sophisticated urban audience. Paintings of this type became popular in Venice in the early 1500s, when pastoral poetry and drama also began to flower.
Giovanni Savoldo depicts Mary Magdalene peering from behind shimmering folds of satin fabric. AlthoughChristdoes not appear, the strong light that bathes the left half of the painting implies his illuminating presence. The half-shadow cast on the Magdalene's face makes her appear vulnerable and tentative while also functioning as a metaphor for her enlightenment. Her slightly inclined head resting upon her cloaked right hand suggests an air of contemplation as she comes to recognize Christ's presence. Her sumptuous clothing may allude to her former life as a prostitute, and herattributeof the ointment jar, seen in the lower left corner, refers both to her anointing of Jesus' feet at a dinner and to her expectation of anointing the body of Christ in his tomb.
Caught in quiet contemplation, this unidentified man gazes intently downward. Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo's mastery of chalk and his careful use of shadows and highlights increase the sense of drama in this characteristically penetrating, naturalistic portrayal, one of many that influenced generations of artists.In particular, Savoldo varied the texture and thickness of his strokes of black chalk to create a range of effects. On the left side of the sheet, for example, a mass of inky lines silhouettes the edge of the man's face. Savoldo drew the chalk lines around the edge of his chin more lightly, giving the impression of a wispy mustache and beard that softens into the hollows of his neck and cheeks. The gray-green tone of the paper serves as a middle tone between the black outlines and the white gleam on the man's forehead and ear.
Using the dramatic effects ofchiaroscuro, Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo created a brooding image of Saint Paul. To do this, he used a combination of black, white, and red chalk on blue paper--the paper favored by most Venetian artists during the 1500s and 1600s. As Saint Paul gazes down, the light touches his broad forehead, nose, and ear, showing his furrowed brow, gaunt cheeks, and thinning hair with forceful naturalism. His beard and mustache seem to absorb the light, obscuring his deeply shadowed mouth, neck, and shoulders. Set against a darkened background, the saint's head seems to rise out of the gloom. Although early church documents describe Paul as being short, bald, and ungainly, Savoldo gave him a sense of quiet dignity appropriate to one of the founders of the Christian Church
The Savonnerie workshops, the royal manufactory that provided carpets, screens, and covers for chairs and benches for the sole use of the French royal household, made this pair of three-panel screens of knotted woolen pile. Such screens were known asparavents(against the wind) and were usually kept folded in the corners of dining rooms or anterooms of the palaces. When needed, servants would arrange the screens to protect the occupants from drafts.The Savonnerie manufactory produced eight different designs for screens, of which the Getty Museum's examples are the tallest. Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay provided thecartoonsfor these screens in 1714, and Franois Desportes drew the birds in the central panels. Each panel has a yellow ground, while the flowers, leaves, and birds are woven in equally vivid shades. The relatively unfaded colors of this pair make them exceptional in comparison to other surviving screens.
In the 1700s folding screens of this size, known asparavents, were used mainly in salons or dining rooms to protect the occupants from drafts. This screen has four panels made after two repeating designs. Two panels depict brown-and-cream rabbits in front of a trellis of peach trees, with monkeys and birds on top. The other two panels contain three waterfowl at the base; above, a blue and yellow macaw clings to a trellis of roses and squawks at an African crowned crane. The borders of these scenes imitate the shape of gilt woodboiseries(wood paneling) that would have covered the walls of rooms where they were used.The wool panels were knotted like a carpet and attached to a wood frame with rows of brass tacks.
This finely painted work depicts theAnnunciation: theArchangel Gabrielannouncing to theVirgin Marythat she has been chosen to become the mother ofChrist. In a rather personal interpretation of the theme, Godfried Schalcken represented Mary as a young Dutch woman in contemporary dress, holding a loose scroll rather than the traditional book. The swirling clouds at his knees, the pointing gesture, and the bright light around the angel's head betray Gabriel's spiritual status, for he has no wings or traditional symbols to identify him as God's messenger. Bright light illuminates Mary's thoughtful face. Schalcken delicately manipulated light and shadow to describe the folds in Gabriel's white gown and the shadows cast by his outstretched right arm and tilted head.The small size, high degree of finish, and unconventional treatment of the subject matter indicate that the painting was intended for private devotion.
Copying his teacher Albrecht Drer, who produced a similarwoodcut, Hans Schufelein set this scene from the life ofChristin contemporary rather than ancient times. AGothicchapel forms the backdrop as Christ bids farewell to his mother, theVirgin Mary. As she kneels on the ground with hands clasped, Mary and Martha of Bethany join her, both bewailing Jesus' imminent departure.Schufelein concentrated on the figures in theforeground, using a series of hatched and cross-hatched strokes to build up their forms. Patterns of parallel lines give form and texture to the fluid drapery and texture to Christ's and the women's faces. Thebackground, in contrast, is much more loosely rendered, with hurriedly sketched foliage, buildings, and figures.
The contrasting textures and subtly modulated hues of this warm, sunny mountain valley; the high-rising rocks and trees that form a strong vertical element; and the picturesque buildings in thebackgroundreflect the artists' debt to DutchItalianatelandscape painters. Dutch landscapes of this type were collected in eighteenth-century England and France, where they influenced the development ofRococolandscape painting.A landscape specialist, Herman Nauwincx usually collaborated with a figure painter, in this case Willem Schellinks, who adapted himself easily to the style of Italianate artists such as Nauwincx. Both artists were active in Amsterdam, where this poetic panel was probably painted. The subject of a wooded mountain landscape with water in theforegroundis typical of Nauwincx, whose prints offer parallels with this scene.
Having just fallen off his rearing horse,Saint Paullies prostrate on the ground. His closed eyes hint at the blindness that struck him the moment thatJesusappeared in the clouds to him. From Jesus' mouth flow the words recorded in theActs of the Apostles:Saule, Saule, quid me persequeri (Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me)  The artist emphasized the drama and emotion of the moment by undercutting the horse's head and front leg and by carving Paul withforeshorteningand in the greatest depth to suggest projection into the viewer's space.Saint Paul, originally Saul, was a Pharisee who persecuted Jesus' followers until the episode depicted here. The fall, during which Jesus called upon him to take up an apostolic mission, led to his conversion and a change of name from Saul to Paul. The limewood panel depicting this pivotal moment in Saint Paul's spiritual life is paired with a panel of the PenitentSaint Peter. Together the two served as meditational images, perhaps intended for aKunstkammeror collector's cabinet. Alternatively, since sculptor Christoph Daniel Schenck often worked for monasticpatrons, the pair may have been housed in amonastery.
With remorse and anguish because he has just betrayedJesus, theapostlePeter clasps his hands and closes his eyes, clearly in torment. His deeply carved facial features and furrowed brow express his spiritual pain, as do the sway of his body and the turbulent, swirling drapery. Behind this dominating figure, sculptor Christoph Daniel Schenck includedbackgroundscenes. On the left through a window, Roman soldiers torment Jesus, while on the lower right, amplifying the context of Peter's guilt, Peter denies knowing Jesus in the midst of a group of soldiers. Above, a cock stands on a ledge, referring to Jesus' prophecy that Peter would deny him three times before the cock crowed. By carving these background scenes in low relief and in smaller scale, the artist focused attention on Peter as a penitent in a moment of confession and internal transformation. The panel depicting spiritual change and its pair, the Conversion ofSaint Paul, probably served as devotional objects for a privateKunstkammeror collector's cabinet or perhaps in amonastery.The heightened emotionalism of the pieces is characteristic of GermanBaroquesculpture. Limewood was a popular material because its relative softness and uniformity allowed the sculptor great freedom of expression in carving.
Saint Catherine kneels on a ramp of steps, at the top of which are seated theMadonna and Child. With both hands, the Child reaches forward to place a ring on Saint Catherine's finger, symbolizing her spiritual engagement to God. An angel in the bottom right corner holds Saint Catherine's attributes of a wheel and a martyr's crown. To the left, an elderly doge kneels between Saints Mark and Francis.Saint Mark, thepatron saintof Venice, is accompanied by his identifyingattribute, the lion, also a symbol of the city.  Behind the figures, beneath a dramatic sky, sailing ships move across a hazy cityscape.Schiavone's sheet is a highly finished compositional study for a painting formerly in the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, but destroyed by a fire in 1574. Francesco Donato, thedogedepicted in the drawing commissioned the painting. Inspired by a painting by Titian, Schiavone used the staircase to develop a dynamic diagonal flow of action. The strong verticals of the canopy and architecture behind the figures balance thecomposition. Freely appliedhighlightsin white gouache and brown ink animate the scene.
In this scene, Prince Josaphat rides abroad with a great entourage, encountering people with physical maladies for the first time. His horse stops just before a blind man being led by a dog. The man's closed eyes are an unmistakable clue of his blindness, yet the nave Josaphat still raises his hand in a gesture of greeting. A lame man appears in theforeground, lifting a cup for alms. In the upper right-hand corner, a man is hanged in the gallows while another is tortured on the wheel.This scene portrays a pivotal moment in the story of Josaphat. As in the story of Prince Siddhartha (later known as the Buddha), the young privileged prince had wished to venture out from the confines of the palace. Unable to deny his son's request, King Avenir instructed a group of escorts to accompany Josaphat abroad and to protect him from the sight of the harsh realities of life, a Herculean task that proved to be impossible. The sight of illness and death--and the realization that these conditions were inevitable for all humans--shattered Josaphat's worldview.
Within the royal residence's vaulted audience hall, Barlaam holds a large gem before the young Indian prince Josaphat. Barlaam, amonk, gains access to Josaphat by disguising himself as an elegant merchant and announcing that he has a precious gem with magical properties. The prince is intrigued and admits the stranger. Barlaam proceeds not to describe the gem and its powers, but to quote Christ's parable of the sower--recounted in the Gospels--in which only the seeds that fall on good earth bring forth fruiting plants. Josaphat listens and declares that he is interested in hearing the word of salvation from Barlaam, indicating that he--like the good earth receiving the seeds--ispreparedto receive the Christian message that the monk has to offer.
The waters of the Red Sea, which had parted forMosesand his followers, come rushing back to engulf the Egyptian soldiers and their horses. The artist has made this scene more accessible to his medieval audience by dressing these ancient characters in contemporary dress and by placing a picturesque medieval town on one bank of the sea.A familiar Biblical story, the Crossing of the Red Sea is told to Josaphat by the learnedmonkBarlaam who has come from a foreign land to seek out the disillusioned young prince. Barlaam gained access to King Avenir's palace by claiming to be a merchant in possession of a splendid gem whose magical properties and beauty are unsurpassed. The gem is the hopeful message ofChristianity. This particular Biblical story is one of many that Barlaam told to Josaphat in order to impress upon him God's miraculous powers.
Through Barlaam's teaching, the prince came to admireChristianityand embraced the religion. In this scene, Josaphat kneels before a baptismal font, his hands clasped together in prayer. A cleric performs the baptism with the aid of a cleric who holds a religious service book open for him. In the original version of the story, Josaphat's baptism took place secretly in the garden pool of his father's palace. This image, however, represented the scene in a manner familiar to its medieval audience, which would have recognized a baptism as a carefully orchestrated Christian ritual.
Wearing a a sorcerer's hat and spectacles, the chief pagan orator of King Avenir's court argues before Christian scholars. A banner surmounted by a small horned devil appears directly above the man's head. The king, positioned on a throne to the right, is a champion of the pagans. Josaphat, for his part, sits deferentially at his father feet but faces those on the left who are arguing the Christian cause. To prevent any confusion about his true loyalty, the young prince holds up a processional cross in his right hand.King Avenir, hoping to return his son to the idolatrous fold, called for a debate between scholars from the two opposing faiths, agreeing with his son that they would both follow the religion that proved victorious in the debate. Although the debate was rigged to favor the pagans, the Christians triumphed in the end. King Avenir kept his promise and was baptized.
In his whole-hearted effort to embraceChristianity, Josaphat took a vow of chastity. Here he resists the charms of a beautiful woman sent to entice him. Concerns about the temptations of the flesh and the role of women as seductresses were constant themes in literature throughout the later Middle Ages and theRenaissance.
A king arrives on the left with an attendant, holding a box full of bones. Met by priests and clerics, the group will proceed into the church where the bones will be kept asrelics, to be venerated and allowed to work their miracles. In the upper left corner, the church bell rings in honor of this great occasion.Following the death of King Avenir, Josaphat retired to the desert as a hermit, leaving the kingdom in the hands of a capable man named Barachias. When Barachias learned the sad news of Josaphat's death, he traveled out to the desert to mourn, and then decided to transfer the remains of Josaphat and his faithful mentor, Barlaam to a church that Josaphat himself had been instrumental in building.
Organized into afrieze, Sleyman the Magnificent's stately procession travels from left to right. The sultan sits under a canopy, surrounded by turbaned followers and two horses carrying thepalanquin. The pennants, the front of the canopy, and its crest prominently display the crescent moon, symbol of theOttoman Empire. The relatively emptybackgroundshows more of the Sultan's followers leading camels and a church and fortified building burning quickly.Sleyman had invaded Europe in 1532 but met with defeat, largely because of the Christian defense of the town of Gns in Austria. This drawing commemorates that event and was probably produced in the same year. The pageantry of the whole scene seems to have been the element that most interested Erhard Schn. In this preliminary sketch for the middle block of a large three-blockwoodcut, he took great care to show many details of the costumes, the various weapons each footman carries, and the intricate embroidery, fringes, and tassels of Sleyman's canopy.
One of the earliest surviving northern European botanical studies drawn from life, this drawing shows a fully opened peony bloom, viewed first from the front and then from the back, and one bud. Martin Schongauer achieved subtly gradated coloration by laying in the basic forms in a broad painterly wash and then describing the details in bodycolor, opaque water-based color, with the point of the brush. Though an outstanding example of a highly finished drawing, it was made as a study for the painting,The Madonna of the Rose Gardenof 1473, in the Dominican church in Colmar.During the late 1400s, people began to perceive the natural world in a radically different way. They ventured out into nature to study it and record it firsthand. Along with others artists, Schongauer became one of the leading pioneers of an effort to make studies directly from nature.
Although he was reportedly a prolific painter, this panel is one of only seven paintings by Martin Schongauer in existence today. It belongs to a group of four Andachtsbilder, or devotional paintings, created near the end of his life. In his engravings Schongauer already had explored the theme of theMadonna and Childreading a book in a niche, symbolizing the Virgin's role as Christ's tutor. Here he balanced the Madonna's serenity with the livelyChristChild and the book's fluttering pages. Her dignified face, with its polished modeling and delicate features, is typical of Schongauer, who was heavily influenced byFlemishpainter Rogier van der Weyden's art. Mary's cascade of gently flowing hair shows Schongauer's sensitivity to the expressive potential of line. His attention to detail is especially evident in the thin gold seams in Mary's cloak, the jeweled crown, and the figures' fine facial features. In thebackground, an angel holds the crown and scepter. Since the 1500s, Schongauer has been credited with bringing the advances of NetherlandishRenaissanceart to Germany. He was the main inspiration for Germany's next generation of artists, notably Albrecht Drer. Schongauer's engravings had far-reaching impact, influencing Italian artists such as Michelangelo.
This drawing of a crowned female saint could have been made as part of a model book, to be used and reused in any number ofcompositions. Her downcast, sorrowful expression, indicative of piety and suffering, harmonizes with the broken, twisting folds of her robe. During the second half of the 1400s in Germany, drawing emerged as an important art form, and this is one of the relatively rare surviving examples from this period.
Without any practical function, this table was conceived like a sculpture and probably served as pure decoration in a Roman palace. It is composed of twisted laurel branches and berries that sprout from a rocky base. An eagle with outstretched wings and holding another laurel branch in its beak has landed in the center. Large, curling seashells form the top. Scholars cannot tell whether these elements might have had special emblematic meanings or whether they were chosen simply for their decorative qualities.A 1713 guidebook of Rome mentions a room in the Palazzo Altieri that was decorated as  an artificial cave, composed of mountains and rocks. Inside is a bed made of tree-trunks, a table, a fountain...  The Getty Museum's table would not have been out of place in such a grotto.
This female figure with crossed arms is typical of the sculpture of the Cyclades in the mid-2000s B.C. Scholars have dividedCycladicsculpture into groups or types indicating stylistic and chronological developments. This nearly complete figure features stylistic traits of both the Spedos and Dokathismata types, such as the exaggerated curve of the top of the head, the deep groove between the legs, and the prominent aquiline nose. The slightly swollen belly of this figure may indicate pregnancy. As preserved today, most Cycladic figures appear almost minimalist, but their original effect--with painted facial features, hair, and occasionally jewelry--was quite different. On this figure, only traces of red paint remain on the forehead.
This drawing of a man was made in preparation for a commemorative portrait medal. Hans Schwarz paid close attention to details of the sitter's profile, carefully rendering his broad nose and curly locks with sure, clear strokes, and recording his fashionable felt hat and lace collar. An inscription on the medal made after this drawing--now in the collection of a German museum--identifies the sitter as Anton Rem, a member of one of Renaissance Augsburg's wealthiest families.
Jan van Scorel orchestrated a multitude of media to create the carefully composed pastoral landscape on the recto. First, he lightly sketched the scene in brown ink and then liberally applied reddish wash and touches of yellow wash. Finally, he strengthened the composition with pen lines, including the foreground's rough, dense hatching and the invigorating half-moon squiggles of the vegetation. Van Scorel's lively pen work, combined with the colored washes, enhances the spatial recession and lends the sheet its dynamism.The yellow wash also evokes the sun-drenched tones of the Italian countryside. Van Scorel was the first northern Netherlandish artist to absorb the influence of Italian High Renaissance art in its native country. In Italy he learned the elements of Italian Renaissance approach to landscape painting, an idealized vision of Roman antiquity where shepherds tended flocks in serene, hilly terrain. This drawing is a type of imaginary scene known as a pastoral-- pastor  meaning  herdsman -- landscape.On the verso, a pyramid and other classical ruins are sketched in light brown ink; two muscular, draped male figures, perhaps river gods, are drawn in darker brown ink below.
Using pen and brown ink, Sinibaldo Scorza created a powerful drawing by combining studies of two animals of strongly contrasting temperament--an uneasy, sinister-looking wolf and two doves roosting peacefully nearby. Forceful strokes of the pen delineate the rough texture of the wolf's shaggy coat, its alert stance, and panting expression. The thicker lines around its tail and belly suggest the softer furry tufts. Scorza probably drew the animals from life, closely observing their positions and expressions. Scorza drew at least four versions of this wolf, both with and without the doves. Both strong draftsmanship and a direct, unsentimental attitude distinguish this drawing. The clarity of the lines and simple, linear forms suggest that the drawing could easily have been engraved, but scholars have not discovered such an engraving. European courtly collectors of the 1600s commissioned many such pictures of animal subjects.
Although John Singer Sargent was the most famous American portrait painter of his time, he apparently did not like to be photographed. The few photographs that exist show him at work, as he is here, sketching and puffing on a cigar. His friend Sarah Choate Sears, herself a painter of some note, drew many of her sitters for photographs from the same aristocratic milieu as Sargent did for his paintings.
In this highly sculptural drawing of a head, Sebastiano del Piombo combined black and white chalk to fully model a three-dimensional form. The roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of the play of light over the saint's face. Roughly drawn lines suggest the tousled curls on his head, while softer shadows darken his cheeks and eye socket. White chalk highlights the edges of his nose and ear.Sebastiano produced this cartoon for the figure of Saint James in a fresco in a chapel in Rome. In the final fresco, the head of the saint appears at a sharp angle; the joins of the sheets making up this cartoon indicate that it also was composed this way. This head once formed part of a larger sheet, but someone silhouetted it at a later date.
Following the model that Raphael had established for papal portraits, Sebastiano del Piombo paintedPope Clement VII(Giulio de'Medici) in three-quarter length and seated in an armchair which is placed diagonally to the picture plane.In a letter dated July 22, 1531, Sebastiano told Michelangelo that Pope Clement had visited his studio to see a new portrait of himself painted on canvas. Very pleased, the pope ordered another version for his collection, this one to be painted on stone. Sebastiano had begun painting on stone around 1530 and had come to favor it for some important commissions because stone lasted longer than canvas or wood. Pope Clement apparently shared Sebastiano's desire to immortalize his portrait by using this durable support.
Seeley took up photography after studying art in Boston and becoming acquainted with Fred Holland Day. Seeley became known for making highly idealized figure studies that often suggest imagery created by British poets of the Romantic movement--William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The model in this photograph carries a lyre and may represent Orpheus, a mythological Greek musician and a popular subject for nineteenthcentury poets. In his 1821 poem  Hellas,  Shelley wrote:  A loftier Argo cleaves the main,   Fraught with a later prize;  Another Orpheus sings again,   And loves, and weeps, and dies;   A new Ulysses leaves once more   Calypso for his native shore. 
Four chrysanthemum blossoms laid upon a table cast deep, black shadows, indicating a light source slightly above and to the left. Behind them a glass bowl barely reveals its own shape while picking up flecks of light and indeterminate shapes from the room. The murky sphere softly mirrors the blossoms' reflection and transmits theforegroundlight to enrich the image with depth. As subtle as a hum or whisper, this evocative and simple still life quietly resonates in George Seeley's photograph. The subdued tones and muted white flowers emerge from a watery, twilight gray, indicating Seeley's considerable skill and sensitivity in handling thegum bichromateprocess.
These stools were part of an order of sixty-four for the French queen Marie-Antoinette'ssalles de jeux(gaming rooms) at the palaces ofFontainebleauand Compigne. Originally covered with painted satin, they were delivered with twelve matching fixed-leg stools (tabourets), a folding screen, and a fire-screen. Their carved decoration consists of typicalNeoclassicalmotifs: oak wreaths, scrolling ribbons, beading, and rosettes.The wooden X-frame base, a traditional design that originated inclassical antiquity, allowed each stool to fold easily once its cushion was removed. Thus they could be easily transported from room to room.
Though Georges Seurat created many portraits of his mother, none have the arresting sense of calm and simplicity seen in this drawing. Here, he filled almost the entire sheet with Madame Seurat's face. Her downcast eyes create an aura of modesty, and suggest that she is involved in a quiet activity such as reading or embroidery. She is plain, though not severe, with pulled back bun and slightly thick features--an unassuming motherly personage, apparently unaware that she is being observed. The drawing possesses an almost mystical aura, combining extreme intimacy and proximity with the equally extreme interiority of the sitter's facial expression. Her puzzling physical presence and psychological stillness is made all the more vaporous and ghostly by the drawing technique Seurat called  irradiation,  which avoided distinct lines and represented the subtleties of light and shadow through tones of black crayon.The drawing was surely full of meaning for mother and son. Even after Georges Seurat moved to his own quarters in 1880, he dined with his mother almost every night. Their close relationship and frequent contact meant that he did not need to look far for a subject with whom he was intimately acquainted. Seurat gave this drawing to his mother.
 [E]ven [Georges Seurat's] simple sketches are so studied in contrast and gradation that one could paint from them without seeing the model again,  said Seurat's contemporary, painter Paul Signac.Seurat's large, velvety forms show dark poplar trees barely emerging from an even darker sky, their bases rooted in the meadow. Several more poplars stand at the right, more shadowy still. Clearly visible through the Cont crayon rubbing, the watermarkMICHALLETemphasizes the paper's surface. This nearly abstract drawing, with its complete lack of edges among the forms, is a study in the pure interaction of light and shadow.When Seurat returned to Paris in 1880, he spent two years drawing in only black and white. This choice allowed him to explore the phenomenon of light's interpenetration and reflection. While absorbed in his preoccupation with gradation and contrast rather than line, he soon mastered the balance of massing light and dark. He developed a unique method of rubbing Cont crayon across highly textured paper, which gave him a variety of tones according to the degree of pressure he applied.
The graceful woman in this drawing appears in the midst of a leisurely stroll, with her shadow falling beside her and one hand gently clutching the handle of her umbrella. The veil of her brimmed hat conceals her face, but her slender figure and erect posture convey that she is a refined young woman--an impression sustained by the fashionable fur-trimmed coat that envelops her.Georges Seurat drew this elegant profile as a series of geometric volumes animated by the play of light and shade. Rather than drawing individual lines, he rubbed roughly textured paper with greasy Cont crayon, creating a large shadowy mass. By combining various densities of crayon--darker for the figure, light and feathery for the background--Seurat explored a concept he called  irradiation.  According to his theory, light and dark tones mutually enhance each other as they come together. The glowing halo surrounding the poised figure exemplifies this theory.
This green basket has pierced sides molded in imitation of canework. The arched handle simulates bound cane that has been wrapped with a gilt-edged ribbon.The records of the SvresPorcelainManufactory show that in December 1757 the painter Franois Boucher was given a small greenpanier(basket), probably this very piece. Boucher, who produced many designs for the factory, was frequently rewarded with porcelain gifts.
A modeler at the SvresPorcelainManufactory based these figure groups on incidents depicted in a comic opera,La Valle de Montmorency(The Vale of Montmorency), a popular production in Paris in 1752. Franois Boucher designed the costumes and stage sets for this work. The success of the opera inspired porcelain makers to produce these figure groups,The Flute LessonandThe Grape Eaters,based on Boucher's paintings of scenes from the production.This was modeled under the direction of Etienne-Maurice Falconet.
This ewer and basin were probably made for display rather than for practical purposes. The vivid color of their pink ground, a new innovation in 1757 when this set was made, would have been particularly admired because it was expensive to produce and difficult to fire. The pink decoration with its gilded outlines imitates molded water lily leaves.This pair is the larger of two sizes of ewers and basins of this shape made by the SvresPorcelainManufactory, only a small number of which survive today. Scholars attribute the design of the models for this set to Jean-Claude Duplessis, the innovative head of the Svres modeling studio.
The Svres porcelain manufactory first produced the design for this pair of cups and saucers in 1752. The design was named after Pierre Calabre, one of the shareholders of the Vincennes porcelain manufactory that preceded Svres. The bold decoration of green panels with a deep pink ground was a popular fashion for only two years, from 1759 to 1761.A hostess usually served tea in the cup; the guest then poured it into the deep saucer to cool and used the saucer as a drinking dish.
Designed to hold two candles each, this pair of vases would have formed part of a garniture of similarly decorated vessels. The decoration on these vessels--pink and green ground colors and scenes based on seventeenth-century paintings--typifies theRococostyle used at the Svresporcelainmanufactory around 1760. Charles-Nicolas Dodin based the rustic scene of a standing couple on a painting by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger.
This boat-shaped vase is one of the most famous models introduced by the Svresporcelainmanufactory; such discerning patrons asMadame de Pompadourand her brother themarquis de Marignycollected the form. Among the largest vessels produced by the factory, these vases were extremely difficult to fire; the multiple piercings in the body weakened the overall structure, and they tended to collapse in the kiln. Consequently, only about twelve were ever produced, ten of which survive today.The shape derives from thenef, a table decoration in the form of a ship, usually of precious metals, used since medieval times. This vase would have held potpourri used to perfume a room. Eighteenth-century ladies made their own, experimenting with various ingredients and sometimes blending essences for as long as nine years. Vases known asvaisseau  mat(masted ships) were made to be sold with other vases of different shapes to form a garniture. Claude-Nicolas Dodin painted the rustic scene on the front, copying an engraving after a painting by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger.
The complex construction and decoration of this pair of vases reveal the level of skill achieved by the craftsmen employed at the Svres porcelain manufactory. Each vase is divided into three sections: a base with holes for flowering bulbs, a tall body with pierced shoulders for potpourri, and a pierced lid. Painted ripples along the base and waves that project up the body, simulating cascades of water, give these vases their name ofpot pourri fontaine.Charles-Nicolas Dodin, who painted the Chinese figures on the sides, copied them from Chinesewoodcutsof about 1700.These vases once formed part of a garniture owned byMadame de Pompadour, mistress ofLouis XV. An inventory taken after her death in 1764 mentions that the garniture was displayed on the mantelpiece in her bedroom. The set was accompanied by matching porcelain wall lights, a pair of candelabra, and a potpourri vase(vaisseau  mat),both now in theMuse du Louvre.
Roasted and peeled chestnuts were a particular delicacy in the 1700s, served as a dessert with a coating of icing in bowls such as this pair. Factories generally sold the bowls singly, though they also came in pairs as part of a dinner or dessert service.The Svresporcelainmanufactory's stock books list several different designs for chestnut bowls. For bowls with pierced decoration, such as this pair, customers would have to pay nearly twice as much as for less intricate examples. It took all the skills of the kiln manager to prevent the sides from separating or sagging each time the piece was fired. He would have fired this pair three times, once for the porcelain body and the ground color, once for the enameled colors, and once for thegilding.
This small covered cup with its deep saucer was designed to serve warm milk at breakfast. A military trophy decorates the center of the saucer, while specific battle scenes fill the reserves. The depicted battles took place between Prussia and Saxony in 1756 and 1757, at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Saxony in August 1756, occupying the capital of Dresden. French troops were never deployed in this part of Europe, so the decoration could have been of little interest to a French buyer. As only one other similar example (ancuelle) survives, scholars assume that a German client, wishing to commemorate either the taking of Dresden by the Prussians or its recapture by the Saxons, specifically commissioned this cup and saucer and thecuelle.
In 1758 the Svresporcelainmanufactory introduced this shape, designed to be mounted onto a small table. The manufactory named the form, described in the Svres archives as aplateau de Courteille ou de chiffonire,after the marquis de Courteille, one ofLouis XV'sfinanciers, who represented the king's interest at Svres from 1751.The Svres artist Charles-Nicolas Dodin copied the scene from a painting by Franois Boucher onto the plaque. The original painting was set into wood paneling above a door in an important Parisian townhouse, the Htel de Soubise. It became one of Boucher's most popular scenes in the 1700s, known through many prints that circulated widely throughout Europe.
The name of this vase,cuvette Mahon,refers to the British-occupied port of Mahn on the island of Minorca, which was captured by the French in 1756 at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. In addition to thecuvette Mahon,this French victory spawned other objects named after the town, including asauce  la Mahonnaise,now known as mayonnaise.The blue and gold decoration in three different patterns--trellis,pointill,andvermicul--over a pink ground is an unusual combination, very rarely seen on Svresporcelain. Jean-Louis Morin, who painted the farmyard scene, copied it from an engraving after a painting by theFlemishartist David Teniers the Younger.
A sick or elderly person with an unsteady hand could have comfortably used this cup with its recessed saucer. The deep well kept the drink in the cup from being easily knocked over and spilled. One of few examples of Svres porcelain with a pink ground overlaid with dark blue, the cup has unusual swirling patterns that enliven the ground, while bunches of fruit and flowers fill the white reserves.Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, purchased all the cups with recessed saucers listed in the Svres porcelain manufactory's sales records between 1759 and 1764. This cup and saucer therefore probably came from her collection. She paid between sixty and seventylivresfor each cup--the equivalent of a month's wages for an experienced porcelain painter.
Madame Louise of France, the eighth daughter of the French King Louis XV, probably drank from this bowl. Known as ancuelle,it would have heldbouillon--a light, nourishing broth taken as a snack between meals. Madame Louise's monogramMLand the coat of arms of an unmarried royal princess are painted on the lid and dish.Lidded bowls with accompanying dishes were produced in large numbers at the Vincennes and Svres Porcelain Manufactory in a variety of shapes, sizes, and decorative schemes. Royal coats of arms rarely appear on Svres porcelain, and monograms are almost as uncommon, except on certain dinner services.
Travelers to the Far East and the New World brought back three new hot drinks to Europe during the 1600s: tea, coffee, and chocolate. By the middle of the 1700s, these drinks had become part of the daily life of the aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie, requiring new serving vessels from which to pour them. Chocolate was considered a breakfast drink, tea was drunk in the afternoon, and coffee was taken after dinner.Porcelain was the favorite material for tea, coffee, and chocolate services, as it did not crack with heat and remained fairly cool to the touch, unlike silver vessels. This tea service, consisting of two cups and saucers, a covered sugar bowl, teapot, and tray, displaysRococoshapes and Neoclassical-style painted decoration. The pierced and lobed tray, with ribbons entwined around the handles and latticework panels, is typically Rococo; in contrast, the use of neat, symmetrical arrangements of floral garlands and arabesques is aNeoclassicaltrait.
This melon-shaped vase is a fine example of the bold and innovative forms introduced at the Svres porcelain factory in the 1760s. Produced in the earlyNeoclassicalstyle, known asgot grec(Greek taste), these designs used simpler, more sculptural decoration than in the past. Architecturalmotifssuch as the acanthus spikes inset in the fluted sides of the vase replaced painted flowers and landscapes, and ground colors became richer.
Described in the archives of the Svresporcelainmanufactory as avase  panneaux(paneled vase), this lidded vase was named for its prominent reserve panels, which show pastoral and floral designs. The porcelain painter based the front scene on an engraving of a Dutch painting by Nicholaes Berchem. Porcelain painters in France in the 1700s were particularly fond of copyinggenrescenes from the previous century to decorate their vessels.Not only the painted scenes but also the gilding on this vase are typical of the grandest works produced at Svres. The gilding is of outstanding quality, thickly applied and then carefully tooled to create varied borders and patterns with subtle textures. Laurel leaf branches with berries and veined leaves and a wide band with zigzag lines frame the reserve panels. The gilded surfaces of the handles, the laurel swags, and the gadroons above the foot areburnishedin imitation of gilt bronze.
Documents in the Svres porcelain manufactory archives call these vesselsvases  ttes de bouc( goat's head  vases), after their elaborate handles modeled in the form of rams' heads with grape vines hanging from their mouths. Despite their removable stoppers, these vases were purely decorative objects, serving no practical purpose.The distinctive decoration of bold patterns ingildingover a dark blue ground is typical of a style popular in the 1760s. The Svres manufactory only introduced this deep blue glaze, known first asbleu nouveau(new blue) thenbeau bleu(beautiful blue), in 1763.
These  egg vases  are of exceptional quality: basketwork bases support egg-shaped bodies and bundles of straw form the handles, while small eggs resting in straw nests serve as the finials for each lid. Each vase is decorated with inlaid decoration: the blue ground color, known asbleu Fallot,was scraped away before firing to allow for thegrisaillereserves and for the area in which the supportingputtiwere to be painted. The porcelain painter Jean-Baptiste-Etienne Genest frequently used this technique; for this reason, the decoration is attributed to him.The painted reserves, which imitate carved stonereliefs, show mythological scenes of sacrifices on one side and trophies containing shields, arrows, and an axe on the other.
In the early 1760s, directed by themarchands-merciers,artisans began to make small round worktables; these items became popular, as they could easily be moved around a room for multiple uses. Theporcelaintop, which could withstand heated vessels without damage, was ideal for serving tea or coffee. Some tables were even sold with porcelain tea services that matched the decoration of the top.Themarchands-merciersor dealers were the first to use Svres porcelain plaques in furniture. Creating a worktable such as this one was a complicated process involving many stages. First the dealer commissioned a design and ordered plaques from the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. He then selected anbnisteto make andveneerthe carcass of the table, leaving space for the plaques; a variety of craftsmen also had to design and makegiltbronzemounts. Another specialized worker lined the drawers with silk. Finally thebnisteassembled the table and returned it to the dealer to be sold.
In the 1700s, hosts and hostesses served tea in cups such as this one. To cool a little of the hot liquid at a time, a guest would have poured some tea into the deep saucer and then drunk.Paintings known through engraved copies were popular sources for decoration onporcelainvessels in the 1700s. The porcelain painter tienne-Jean Chabryfils(son), copied the scene on this cup from an engraving of Philip James de Loutherbourg's painting,The Cherished Lamb.The saucer, with its inscriptionL'Avare(The miser), refers to the comedy of the same name by Molire. The paintings on cups and saucers did not necessarily have to relate to each other.
French craftsmen at Svres designed these vases to hold flowering plants and soil in the upper trumpet-shaped section. Water, added through openings in the lower base, fed the plants through small holes pierced near the base of the soil container. The two separate sections permitted easy removal of plants or excess water.The Svresporcelainmanufactory produced this design in five different sizes. Immensely popular, these vases sold in large quantities up until theFrench Revolution.
Richly ornamented with thickly gilded goats' heads, and painted butterflies, birds, and flowers, these vases were intended to be displayed before a mirror, so that both sides of their lavish decoration could be admired. In honor ofLouis XV'sofficial mistress,Madame du Barry, they were namedvases bouc du Barry(goat vases of Barry). The Svres porcelain manufactory sold these vases for the high sum of three hundred and sixtylivres--an amount equivalent to six months' salary for a porcelain painter.Svres artisans made the vases from  true,  hard-paste porcelain, instead of the traditional soft-paste. The hard-paste porcelain recipe was still new, and the craftsmen were still experimenting with different types of decoration when these pieces were produced in 1778. Instead of glazing the vases with ground color and then gilding them, porcelain gilders first applied the gold onto the white body of the vases. Porcelain painters then added enamel colors within the gold outlines. Decorators also experimented with the use of silver on thetrellisworkas seen on these vases, but they soon abandoned this practice since the silver tarnished over time.
These decorative vases would have sat on the mantelpiece to be admired rather than used. Elaborately decorated withgilding, pearl-like beads, and a delicate pinkpointill(dotted) ground, these vases are fine pieces of Svres porcelain, made at the height of the factory's popularity in the 1770s and 1780s.Copying paintings by the French artist Joseph Vernet, the porcelain painter Vincent Taillandier painted the maritime scenes in the reserves on the front and back.
The Svres porcelain manufactory produced numerous plates with a wide variety of decoration, either as matching sets or as part of dinner or dessert services. This example, however, is one of a small number of individually decorated plates intended for display rather than use. The gilding is more finely detailed and the floral reserves more delicately painted than normal. The reddish-brown ground flecked with gold was also experimental and was apparently not used for any other service.Svres may have sold sample plates like this one as collector's items or for presentation to favored clients.
These lidded bowls were intended to hold potpourri, the smell of which passed through the pierced collar. Containers for potpourri first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon produced in large numbers from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer. To create potpourri, fashionable women experimented with dried petals and spices to achieve the finest fragrances, some of which were left to mature for up to nine years. Perfumes and potpourri were used liberally to disguise malodorous air, as indoor plumbing was nonexistent and frequent bathing was considered unhealthy.By means of a drawing in the archives of the Svres porcelain manufactory of a similar, but unmounted bowl, scholars have identified the craftsman who made the twisted and coiledgiltbronzemountson this piece. The drawing, dated 1784, has an inscription noting that it was to be mounted by  Tomier,  Pierre-Philippe Thomire, one of the most celebrated bronze casters of the late 1700s. Thomire is known to have provided bronze mounts for many similar bowls.
This personification of Charity appropriately distributes purses of alms to a destitute woman and her two naked children. Porcelain sculptures depicting such moralizing subjects were popular during the late 1700s, and the Svres porcelain manufactory sold many of them. Wealthy Europeans often used these small figural groups to adorn their dining tables.
These coolers were designed to hold half-bottles of wine set in ice or cold water and probably once formed part of a large dinner service. With their fanciful chinoiserie scenes of gold and platinum pagodas on a black ground, the wine coolers imitate Chineselacquerwork. In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Svres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.
The wood-burning stove in the center of the image casts its warmth and light into the space of the room and illuminates the scene. The stove is thereby rendered as a silhouette, its pipe a black vertical line rising out of the picture frame. Rather than use the stove as intended, Charles Sheeler placed electric bulbs in the stove's belly to simulate the light from a fire. He created a dramatic contrast of lights and darks, of shadows and highlights that turn the empty room into a graphic composition.
In this dramatically illuminated image of a Bucks County barn interior, a parked buggy takes center stage. Charles Sheeler created the vivid contrast between light and dark by placing a photographer's lamp at the far end of the barn. The soft shadows on the right wall of the barn imbue the image with a sense of mystery. Rough-hewn, wooden planks marking the entrance to the stall produce the effect of a picture within a picture, much like a frame around a painting.An overwhelming sense of abandonment permeates the scene. How many years has this buggy remained unused in its stall  In many ways, this photograph documents a disappearing way of life. At the time this image was made, gas and steam-powered vehicles began to replace horse-drawn carriages on America's roadways.Domestic and utilitarian objects fascinated Charles Sheeler. He collected early American furniture and photographed interiors in his native Southeastern Pennsylvania region. Sheeler often used these photographs as studies for paintings and drawings.
Lines and texture define this view of the side of a white barn. In the photographic rendering, the white barn is a soft gray, punctuated by knots in the wood and shadows cast by the uneven boards. In the lower right corner of the image, a small window, a fence, and a chicken standing atop a pile of hay add visual weight yet surrender to the repetitive, vertical domination of the structure. Like every other line, the horizontal line dividing the areas of wood and plaster is drawn without a straight edge.
Sheeler's 1927 photographic commission to document the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge factory outside Detroit resulted in a series of photographs and paintings that cele-brate industry as a subject of beauty and pre-cision. He treated both media equally and never saw one replacing the other, for, as he explained,  the painting being the result of a composite image and the photograph being the result of a single image--prevents the media from being competitive. 
Close-up, this monumental object becomes a different object. The drive wheel and rounded edges of the locomotive's condenser cylinders are barely contained within the frame, which harnesses the engine's powerful movement. With this photograph, Charles Sheeler demonstrated the camera's ability to represent the dynamism of theMachine Age.Sheeler was a Precisionist painter whose style was marked by sharply defined geometric forms and flat planes of focus. Fittingly, he took this photograph while on a commission fromFortunemagazine to create a series of paintings entitled  Power.  Like many photographers, Sheeler frequently used his camera in the same way that a painter uses a sketchbook. This photograph was eventually used as a study for a painting, but it has the strength of a fully realized image.
Tautly suspended from two cables, this slender bronze form hangs rigidly just off the ground. The form's vertical orientation and outstretched  arms  suggest a human figure. But the work conspicuously lacks elements that would imply a head, hands, or feet. Further, while from afar the sculpture's bronze patina appears smooth, it is in fact pocked and striated, more akin to the skin of a scaly reptile than a human.Peter Shelton often titles his work with letters that run together without spaces or upper case distinctions. This technique encourages the viewer to consider words and letters in new ways. The title of this sculpture suggests that it represents an outer garment or covering for a figure rather than a figure itself. The bronze's hollow form supports such a reading. But the work's figural appearance and scale equally encourages the viewer to consider how his or her own proportions, position, and weight relate to the dark, ghostly form before them.
As I stood on the bridge crossing the River Huisne, holding a copy of the [Camille] Silvy print in front of me and examining it in detail to determine its exact vantage point and framing, I was stunned by the changes I saw. Nearly everything in the scene was different or transformed. The trees in Silvy's original had long since disappeared, the stately old trees there now had not even been planted in Silvy's time. Some of the houses had fallen into disrepair, others had been renovated and now, a hundred years later, the renovations themselves looked old. The growth, again, and alteration that had taken place in this apparent changeless scene were astonishing.Thus Stephen Shore described the transformation he encountered when he was commissioned by the J. Paul Getty Museum to revisit the place that Camille Silvy had photographed in 1855.
Camille Silvy photographed these juvenile street musicians outside the door of his studio in Porchester Terrace, London. They are dressed shabbily, not quite in rags; each holds his instrument, a hurdy-gurdy. The seated one scowls at the camera, looking pained, and the standing one eyes the photographer warily. Their position on the outside of the looming open gate suggests that the children are excluded; they belong on the far side of the walls, not inside them. The atmospheric rendering of the distance also separates the harshly drawn boys in the foreground from the soft interior.
When Camille Silvy originally exhibited this photograph in 1859 (with the title Valle de l'Huisne), a reviewer wrote:  It is impossible to compose with more artistry and taste than M. Silvy has done. The Valle de l'Huisne...[is a] true picture in which one does not know whether to admire more the profound sentiment of the composition or the perfection of the details. Early collodion-on-glass negatives, such as those Silvy used to render this scene, were particularly sensitive to blue light, making them unsuitable for simultaneously capturing definition in land and sky. Silvy achieved this combination of richly defined clouds and terrain by skillfully wedding two exposures and disguising any evidence of his intervention with delicate drawing and brushwork on the combination negative. The print exemplifies the tension between reality and artifice that is an integral part of the art of photography.The Huisne River provided power for flour and tanning mills and was significant in the history of Nogent-le-Rotrou, the town where Silvy was born. This photograph was taken from the Pont de Bois, a bridge over the river, looking toward the south and downstream. It was only a few minutes' walk from Silvy's birthplace. As the reviewer suggested, it is a sentimental image, an idyllic landscape full of reverence for and memory of a timeless place that was significant in the artist's development.
The elegantly attired woman in this portrait was one of many aristocratic patrons to visit the London studio of Camille Silvy. The sitter is gracefully posed with her head turned in profile and her hands delicately displaying her bejeweled fingers. She is wrapped in a beaded velvet shawl with a large cameo at her throat and a beaded hair ornament--finery that reflects her aristocratic status.Silvy was well known among the fashionable English aristocracy and accordingly stocked his studio with stylish accessories and props that created a suitable image of wealth and social standing. He was thought to possess superior artistic taste, which directed his skillful handling of models and settings.
I have brought to my picture-making, qualities of expression that came out of my experience of music and literature. My belief in the meaning of abstract expression came from my love of music. And my use of metaphor comes out of my experience of poetry and literature.Made in the abandoned mining town of Jerome, Arizona, this photograph of cracked and peeling paint by Aaron Siskind has an almost musical rhythm that echoes the influences he discussed in the statement above. In Siskind's close-up view, the paint is transformed from the reality of decay into abstracted, multi-layered textures and tones formed by shadow and reflection. Seen in more selective detail than the eye registers at a glance, the paint becomes a metaphor of the passage of time and the impermanence of place.
A bend in the road with tiny, rapidly drawn figures appears amid the lush, green trees on the left. To the right, the landscape opens out with a view of a vineyard on a distant hill. Rather than simply representing the specifics of a location, Alfred Sisley painted the glorious golden light of a summer's day, flickering in the trees and the long grasses. He painted thisplein-airlandscape study somewhere near the road on the way fromVersaillesto Saint-Germain. The painting's broken strokes of brilliant color and the impressionistic brushstrokes that serve as figures would have defined it as a rough sketch, but Sisley judged it complete and presented it as a beautiful finished work.
This man holds the pink very conspicuously, yet its significance in the portrait remains mysterious. The flower was originally named for its bloom shape and time of flowering, at the end of May, aroundPentecost, known in the Netherlands as  Pinkster.  Presumably, the petals' serrated edges were seen as resembling the tongues of flame that descended on Mary and the Apostles at Pentecost, enabling them to speak in any language, spread God's word, and build the Church. Additionally,  pinksten  meant  fiftieth  in German, and Pentecost was celebrated fifty days afterEaster.The portrait has been greatly damaged, but the face and the flower display Michael Sittow's sensitivity to the effects of texture and light. To create his characteristically luminous surfaces, Sittow applied many layers of translucent paint. The sitter's projection of melancholy also typifies Sittow's portraits.
As he worked out compositional arrangements and poses of figures, Karel Skrta filled this sheet with studies of the Virgin and Child adored by saints. On the recto, figures pour across the page almost cinematically, their flowing rhythm lending the entire sheet the feeling of being a single idea. Two compositional studies on the verso display Skrta's sensitivity to the ability of a few well-chosen lines to describe everything. At the left, his economical, delicate lines suggest drapery, relationships, and form. On the right, he made furtherreductionsby gently going over selected red chalk lines with pen and ink. The juxtaposition of pen-and-ink with red chalk also shows how different media affected the quality of Skrta's line.
Backed snarling against a tree, a wild boar fends off the attacking hounds. The bodies of three dogs lie piled in a heap on the left, while others leap towards the boar. Frans Snyders concentrated particularly on the animals' tormented facial expressions, from the angry stare of the cornered boar to the suffering of the hound on its back to the growling fury of the dogs who attack their prey at the rear. Each is caught in suspended motion, leaping, rushing, and growling. Delicately executed pen and brown ink emphasize the boar's wiry coat, whilewashesreproduce the dogs' soft fur and the fine tufts of undergrowth at the back.Many aristocratic patrons in Flanders and throughout Europe in the 1600s favored monumental hunting scenes as a reminder of their passionate love for the chase. Snyders was particularly sought after for his still lifes of animals. He probably produced this drawing as a preparatory study for a later painting. So popular was this painting that at least six copies of it still survive.
As a young boy reaches out with his chubby hand to take a fistful of grapes, a maid reproaches him, placing her hand on his right shoulder. The scene takes place in an abundantly stocked pantry, where various kinds of dead fowl await preparation. The large table upon which the boy sits is laden with baskets, bowls, and platters that overflow with ripe fruit, including apples, peaches, and pomegranates. To complete this picture of domestic life, a cat stands in the window on the upper right, antagonizing two dogs below.Pantry scenes like this were derived from earlier paintings of town markets, which were appreciated for their display of nature's bounty. This painting is a collaborative work by Frans Snyders, who specialized in still lifes and animal subjects, and Jan Boeckhorst, who painted the figures.
While Christ bends beneath a heavy cross, he still retains a serene air. In contrast, the soldier on the right glares back at him ferociously, seemingly determined to add to Christ's burden by pressing down on the cross. Sodoma focused on these facial expressions to emphasize the peace of God, even amidst suffering.Sodoma used a highly elaborate technique to draw this scene, with considerable white heightening to create painterly effects for both the faces and the garments of the figures. He drew the Resurrection on the verso in a more calm, classical manner with a more linear technique. Brush and brown ink delineate Christ's muscular body as he emerges from the edge of the tomb with one foot still inside. Cross-hatching and white heightening build up the folds of drapery that flow around him. Sodoma made this study in preparation for a 1535 fresco of theResurrectionin a public building in Siena.
On a rocky, stagelike, surface,Adonislies mortally wounded after being attacked by a boar while his lover, the goddessVenus, rushes in to tend him. Her fluttering drapery indicating that she has just landed, Venus leans over the youth, already seeing death in his eyes. In the foreground, a tearfulputtoexamines Adonis's wound; behind, a putto pulls Adonis's dog away from the dead boar.Massimiliano Soldani-Benzi closely followedOvid'sMetamorphoses, aclassicaltext that was much read in Baroque Italy. The choice of bronze also suggests an interest in classical culture. This rendition, however, is full of Baroque drama and movement. In particular, the bronze's flamboyant, tragic tone and shallow, frontal composition recall theatrical and operatic productions of the time.Soldani-Benzi was known as one of the finest bronze casters in Florence, frequently casting works of other sculptors.Venus and Adonisis one of his few original mythological groups. This tabletop sculpture originally formed a pair with another, now-lost bronze couple,Tancred and Clorinda, historical figures immortalized in Tasso's epic poem,Gerusalemme Liberata.
Andromeda & Sea MonsterLeda & the SwanMaster sculptor Massimiliano Soldani Benzi cast the bronze groups ofAndromedaand the Sea MonsterandLedaand the Swanaspendants. Each depicts an episode fromclassicalmythology, and the two are visually linked by opposing compositions. Leda reclines, forming a diagonal from the lower right to the upper left. This line is balanced by that created by Andromeda--a diagonal moving from the lower left to the upper right--as she attempts to escape. Both figures also display heightened emotion: Leda expresses seductive eroticism, and Andromeda expresses terrifying horror.Each group retains its original base, golden reddishlacquerpatina, and elaborate matching bronzemountson the base.
Andromeda & LedaAs a sea monster lunges towards her, the nude Andromeda recoils, straining against the chains that tie her to the rocky ledge. Her hair blows behind her, indicating sudden movement. The sharp angles of her eyebrows and nose express anxiety, while the diagonal of her body expresses the repulsion she feels towards the growling beast.Andromeda and the Sea Monsterdepicts a dramatic moment from the ancient Greek author Euripides' tale of Andromeda and Perseus. Andromeda's mother angered the gods with her boast that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, the attendants of the god of the sea, Poseidon. To appease the offended Poseidon, who threatened to destroy their entire kingdom, Andromeda's parents sacrificed their daughter by leaving her where she would be devoured by his monster. As Andromeda awaits the monster, chained to a rock, Perseus flies overhead, falls instantly in love with her, and rescues her by slaying the beast. Massimiliano Soldani Benzi's interpretation of the story is unusual because he focused on Andromeda's horror at the monster instead of on her rescue.
Andromeda & LedaEnamored of the beautiful Leda, the god Jupiter seduced her in the form of a swan. In this bronze version of the mythological scene, Leda and the swan are suggestively posed: the arc of the lovers' embracing arms and wings and the curvature of their bodies, poised before union, increases the erotic suspense. The swath of drapery trapped between Leda's thighs, as well as her movement drawing the swan down towards her, hint at the inevitable moment of union.This tale of seduction, mentioned inOvid'sMetamorphoses, was a popular subject for artists from theRenaissanceonwards. An unusual aspect of this version, however, is that Castor and Pollux, the fruit of the union, are not shown. Instead, the artist includedCupid, the god of love. Perched on his wings, Cupid encourages the amorous Jupiter.The contrasting textures of Leda's smooth voluptuous skin and the swan's feathers hint at Massimiliano Soldani Benzi's technical virtuosity with bronze casting. He made thisLedaas a pendant to another bronze group,Andromeda and the Sea Monster.
The goddess of love,Venus, asked her husband, Vulcan, to make a set of armor forAeneas, her son, when he was about to go to war. Here, Vulcan shows off the richly decorated shield he has made, as Venus andCupidhover above him on a cloud. He gestures to the helmet and sword that lie at his feet.Francesco Solimena made this drawing in preparation for the painting of this subject that now belongs to the Getty Museum. Solimena altered some of the design when he transferred the images from paper to canvas. For example, he changed the position of Cupid and gave him the helmet to hold. Solimena used apainterlycombination of pen and brown ink to outline the figures, black chalk hatching to give texture toVulcan'smuscular legs and the clouds, and brownwashto soften the edges and create deeper shadows.
Venus, the goddess of love, resplendent in a brilliant blue gown, looks down at a gold shield emblazoned with an image ofAthena. Venus went to her husbandVulcan'sforge and asked him to make arms for her sonAeneas. Here, the powerfully built Vulcan holds upright the shield intended for Aeneas, gestures to the armor at his feet, and looks up at his wife for her approval. In the lower left-hand corner are two Cyclopes who have made the armor under Vulcan's direction.Francesco Solimena made a series of mythological paintings for the Procurator Canale in Venice. This canvas and itspendant,Tithonus Dazzled by the Crowning of Aurora,may commemorate a marriage, as both pictures show gifts exchanged between goddesses and their husbands.
Aurora, the goddess of dawn, sits enthroned on a cloud while a winged genius crowns her with a wreath of red and white flowers. Her arms outstretched and raised, Aurora holds a torch in her right hand and a small bouquet of flowers in her left. A putto flies forward carrying a gilded dish of more flowers. Night looms behind but, as goddess of dawn, Aurora will soon dispel the darkness. Below, her aged husband Tithonus shields his eyes from his wife's brightness. After seducing Tithonus when he was young and beautiful, Aurora asked Zeus to grant him immortality, but she forgot to ask for eternal youth as well. Every morning, the eternally youthful goddess had to rise and bid goodbye to Tithonus, who grows older each day.This large canvas and its pendant,Venus at the Forge of Vulcan,were probably parts of a larger ensemble made for the Procurator Canale in Venice. The series may commemorate a marriage, as the two pictures depict gifts exchanged between goddesses and their husbands.
A Roman soldier pulls back his sword to stab the Empress Messalina, Emperor Claudius's spectacularly unfaithful wife, fending off her mother attempts to intercede. A guard, who was in on the murder plot, observes calmly from the shadows in thebackground. A bright, theatrical spotlight emphasizes the intersection of arms and the drama of the life-and-death conflict.This may be the only painted representation of the death of Messalina, a story from theAnnalsof Tacitus. Why Francesco Solimena took or was given this subject is unknown, yet its inherent drama and potential for passion suited theBaroquetaste. Characteristically, Solimena heightened the moment's intensity by creating monumental figures on an already huge canvas and presenting only the essentials of a setting. According to his eighteenth-century biographer, Solimena painted this subject for a series of five canvases of historical and mythological subjects for the state attorney in Venice.
Virgil Solis organized this design for lush, interlaced foliage symmetrically, dividing it with a central urn from which sprout curling grapevines. Four large, drooping flowers and two tiny masks, whose wavy hair and beards echo the scrolling vines, hang from the ends of several of the vines. In antiquity, leafy designs such as this one, known as rinceaux, were popular motifs for ornamenting a variety of forms from furniture to architecture. Such motifs copied from ancient Greek and Roman art fascinated designers in the 1500s.Although both sides of the drawing have been cut off, leaving only the edge of an urn on the right, Solis probably intended to show the beginning of the same repeating pattern. Other artists and craftsmen could then have copied this continuous decorative frieze to ornament a panel on a variety of objects. The horizontal incised lines above and below the design could have been used to transfer the image onto another surface.
The harp on the shield of thecoat of armsindicates that the elderly king with flowing locks and beard on top of a helmet is the biblical King David. The abbreviationO.H.L.might refer to a family name or a motto, while theV.S.was one of several monograms used by the artist Virgil Solis. Scholars do not know the exact purpose of this design, but they believe it may have been made for a bookplate or an etching on glass.Drawings for objects such as tapestries, metal vessels, oil lamps, and furniture exist from the 1500s onwards in far greater numbers than from earlier eras. Scholars believe that this substantial increase suggests not only the important role of drawings in the design process but also their new prestige as collector's items. Drawing was an essential tool for the communication of an artist's ideas to patrons and craftsmen.
With his wavy hair cascading over a headband, the face of Apollo--the god of youth, music, and prophecy--is carved into the surface of this large amethyst. His portrait is presented in full profile. Apollo's features are idealized, as was typical in art of the early Roman Empire: a square face with broad cheeks, a round chin, and a remarkably straight nose.Although this gem closely resembles other images of Apollo, scholars believe the artist, probably Solon, intended this as an idealized portrait not of the god, but of the Roman emperor Augustus. Roman emperors revered individual gods, and Augustus's patron god was Apollo. Augustus believed Apollo secured victory for his forces in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C: Solon carved other images of Augustus and members of the Imperial family in the guise of deities.Look closely and you will notice that the image is carved into the gem--a technique known asintaglio--to create a sense of depth. A Neoclassical gold mount was added to the gem sometime during the late 1700s or early 1800s.
Inspired by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston, Sommer took up large-format photography in 1938. Tilting his camera downward and eliminating the horizon line, the artist filled this frame with visual information. His composition emphasizes the abstract qualities of line and texture within the landscape along the Colorado River, which is itself barely discernible beyond the foreground bluffs. The photograph has the potential to momentarily disorient a viewer searching for a recognizable subject.
For years I looked at the Arizona landscape and it seemed almost a hopeless task. What was the difference between the top of the picture and the bottom of it  It was all the same. These were enormous areas, but still there were details. There's nothing happening in the sky and I decided, 'No skies for me.' Finally there was no foreground, there was no middle distance, there was nothing. And, there was very little distinction between the plants and the rocks. Even the rocks were struggling.Thus Frederick Sommer described his initial difficulties in photographing the barren Arizona landscape. Cacti rise up intermittently from the arid ground like ritual markers, as Sommer's unusualperspectiveand meticulous framing redefine this horizonless desert landscape, a terrain at once both ancient and contemporary.
The bodies of four dead coyotes dry and bleach in the Arizona sun. Tufts of fur poke out beneath the remains of tails, and ribs clearly show through stretched and drying sinew. In this scene, Frederick Sommer'scompositioncelebrates life by contrasting it with its final process--death. The bones and fur stand out as lighter shades against the darkness of the soil beneath, brightening the otherwise dull terrain. Sommer's dynamic composition and framing brings the photograph to life. The coyote on the left side appears to be leaping out of the picture, while another one enters the image from below. In the center, one coyote lies in a suckling position under another. The legs of all the coyotes seem to be captured in mid-motion, adding a sense of action to the image.Sommer used a large-format camera to capture this degree of detail. This photograph was part of a series of images of dead-animal parts that Sommer took between 1938 and 1948.
This image of Surrealist painter Max Ernst posed against a weathered wooden wall has been overprinted with a negative of a rough, water-worn rock surface. As the two negatives merge together, the white-haired painter's flesh absorbs the rock's scaly  poetry of decay,  hinting at Ernst's own advancing age and mortality. A dark horizontal beam cuts across the upper third of the photograph, slicing a recessed path across Ernst's eyes that gives the illusion of a mask. Rather than a straight likeness, this is a psychological portrait, though the viewer must contemplate whether it is an exploration of the subject or the photographer, Frederick Sommer. Ernst's work was influential in the development of Sommer's Surrealist imagery.
Against a backdrop of rusting metal, Frederick Sommer arranged a grouping of found objects. A clipboard clamp represents a head and shoulders while dirty, cracking doll's arms and legs provide more literal context, defining the object as a human body. Within that fragmented body, Sommer places a complete doll with its head pointed downward, as if ready to be born.The photograph's French title,Valise d'Adam,or as Sommer translated it,Adam's Traveling Case,is a sly reference to the idea that man travels through woman into the world, and perhaps, woman even carries man through life.
Sommer photographed statuary during a summer trip to Europe in 1960. He strayed from his usual sharply focused pictures by jarring the camera during exposure, imparting a sense of lightness and movement to the stone. Upon his return to Arizona, he began working with living models. These studies, made with a still camera, are also blurred, but here the obliterated detail and deep shadows make the human body seem like sculpted stone.
Comprised of an illustration torn from an old children's book and a lump of hardened molten metal from a burned-out automobile, this photograph by Frederick Sommer is titled after Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of the same name. The amorphous shape laid on top of an anonymous lithograph of a figure seated in the woods next to a basket closely resembles the outline of the Madonna and Child from the fifteenth-century drawing. The smiling head of a boy emerging from the foliage becomes the infant Saint John. In the union of an abstract object with unrelated representational imagery, Sommer has made an art historical reference that is both literal and spiritual.
Starting in the 1960s, Frederick Sommer produced a series of paper  sculptures  that he then photographed. He cut sheets of butcher-block paper using a razor blade, transforming them into abstract patterns. But these incisions were anything but random; his creations were often inspired by images he found in the hundreds of books he kept on shelves in his workshop. Hanging his paper creations from clips a few feet in front of a wall, he carefully lit them--the shapes, light, and shadow providing a sense of depth and kinetic energy.The inspiration for this piece is the legend of the Three Graces, fertility goddesses from Greek mythology. Light penetrates the slits, suggesting three bodies dancing together. Thecompositionis less about extremes of light and dark, and more about midtones--the subtle differences in grays contained in the spectrum between white and black.
The colored reflections of late afternoon light animate this beach scene and actively define the forms, from the injured child's shoulder to the liquid sea and the figures playing in the water. The sun'shighlightson the hurt child's hand, the sand around her foot, and her companion's hat draw the viewer's attention to the injured limb.While on the beach at Valencia,Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida rapidly painted a group of pictures includingThe Wounded Foot.Like theImpressionistsbefore him, Sorolla worked outdoors to capture the momentary effects of light, water, and people in motion. This painting's casual snapshot-like cropping, which cuts off the arm of the child at the left, gives the viewer the same sense of immediacy, as if he or she has accidentally happened upon an impromptu exchange between two children on the sand.
The play of light on the water and against the sun-drenched walls of the Alhambra, one of Spain's most influential architectural achievements, was ideally suited to Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida's artistic mission: exploring the changing effects of light under the broadest possible range of conditions. Just as the Alhambra's architects had interwoven light and shade, stone and water, Sorolla captured the myriad patterns created by the architecture, water, and light together. The shadows of the thin columns against the walls create a pattern reflected in the water, whose liquidity is remarkable, given the thick gestural paint that Sorolla applied.The thirty-five-acre Alhambra, built between 1238 and 1358, was the last Moslem stronghold in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages. The Moorish architectural style reached its ultimate refinement here, an airy fantasy that almost seems to float, despite its solid construction of stone and stucco.
Handsome and proud, Pepilla sits with one arm around her daughter's shoulders and her other hand on her hip. Both mother and daughter gaze directly out at the viewer. Just as the mother's gesture tenderly protects yet presents her daughter, Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida expressed tenderness in his portraits of Spanish people, particularly women and children.With his typical spontaneous, broad brushwork, Sorolla reveled in the effects of the warm Mediterranean light and air on the colors and patterns in the women's costumes. He preferred to paint even portraits outdoors, trying to achieve a spontaneous effect.  [N]o matter how much labor you may have expended on the canvas, the result should look as if it had all been done with ease and at a sitting,  he said in 1909.
This is one of a series of four paintings of townscapes and garden scenes in Seville that Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida painted in 1910. Two years earlier, he had made a similar series of views in the same city. While he retained the brilliance and atmosphere of his 1908 Seville paintings, he seems to have approached this second series in a more traditional manner.The courtyard of Seville's Alczar Palace, the city's most splendid example of Moorish architecture,  sparkles in the dappled summer sunlight. As always, Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida was concerned with color and light, brilliance and atmosphere. The colored reflections of the light animate the scene and help to define the forms, creating a sense that nature is ever-changing.Sorolla originally chose this frame, made by the firm of Jos Cano, which still exists in Madrid, for the picture. Photographs show the same type ofgiltframe hanging in Sorolla's studio and house during his lifetime.
In this view of the garden at Seville's Alczar Palace, Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida concentrated on the geometry of form and the clear, bright sunlight of southern Spain instead of the changing reflections of light. He had returned to Seville in 1910 to create a second series of paintings, four paintings of townscapes and garden scenes, following the series he had painted in 1908. While he retained the brilliance and atmosphere of his earlier paintings, he seems to have approached this second series in a less fanciful manner.J. Paul Getty had originally determined to collect art only in certain areas, but at the 1933 auction of the Thomas Fortune Ryan collection he bought ten Sorollas, one of his few spontaneous purchases. He later wrote of that moment:  I was struck by the remarkable quality of Sorolla's paintings, being especially fascinated by his unique treatment of sunlight. . . . Although the purchase of theseImpressionistworks was a major digression from my usual fivefold collecting path, my opinion regarding their beauty, appeal and artistic merit remains the same as it was when I first saw the canvases. 
The setting for this daguerreotype is the teaching amphitheater of Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. John Collins Warren, cofounder of the hospital and professor of anatomy, stands with his hands upon the patient's thigh, explaining the proceedings to a student audience seated out of camera range. Dr. Solomon Davis Townsend, who performed the operation, stands behind Warren with his left arm akimbo. An unidentified anesthetist holds a sponge soaked in ether near the head of the patient who, curiously enough, still wears his socks.Warren had commissioned Albert Sands Southworth and Josiah Johnson Hawes to make the first photographic record of an actual live medical operation, which was also the retiring Dr. Warren's last lecture. The doctors' heads all moved during the long exposure, causing blurring and confirming the photograph's candid circumstances.
Hiram Powers's sculpture of a completely nude and very shapely woman was the subject of great controversy when it was created in 1848. He attempted to circumvent criticism of her nudity by casting her as a Christian martyr captured by heathen Turks and sold as a slave.Isolating the sculpture with exquisite lighting and perfect viewpoint, Southworth and Hawes harnessed the erotic marbled splendor of the sculpture, transforming stone to supple flesh with careful modulation and selective rendering.
The superb quality of this plate is evident in the photographer's sensitive use of light and in the young sitter's natural yet graceful pose; it was extremely difficult to achieve this sense of natural poise with a child sitter. Her cherubic face, rendered partly in shadow, is set against a highlighted, vignetted background that gives the young girl an almost spiritual aura. The light falls most brilliantly on her exposed shoulder and on the lace edging and puffed-up fabric of her dress and sleeve.
Shepherd with His Dogdepicts an idyllic pastoral scene, in which a young man leans against a tree stump accompanied by his dog and a sheep at his feet. The dog looks lovingly up at his master, but the youth appears to be gazing elsewhere. Perhaps he is looking in the direction of another figure, because this sculpture was intended to be one of a pair.The sculpture's companion piece,Lady Feeding a Sheep with Hay, features a shepherdess leaning on a gate feeding a pet lamb. As was customary in porcelain figure production, the two are based on an engraving-Shepherd and Shepherdess by Angelica Kauffmann.Shepherd with His Dogmay also be inspired by a famous sixteenth-century Roman statue,Antinous, of a youthful-looking male in the same pose.This elegant fourteen-inch sculpture made of white biscuit porcelain was produced at the Derby Porcelain Factory in England. (Biscuit is a type of unglazed porcelain admired for its marble-like appearance.)Shepherd with His Dogis thought to have been modeled by the highly talented but little-known Swiss porcelain artist Johann Jakob Wilhelm Spngler. The sculpture was originally attributed to two of Spngler's contemporaries, but scholars now believe it to be Spngler's work due to its refined style, graceful lines, and crisp detail.
This diminutiveprayer book, measuring about five by three and one-half inches, engages the viewer in intimate contemplation of both its text and its images. The book contains Latin prayers devoted toChrist, the Virgin, and the saints and is remarkably embellished with thirty-seven largeminiatures, several smaller miniatures, and decorations on every page. The largest miniatures measure only about three inches on the longest side, but they are incredibly detailed, often with deep panoramic landscapes framed by lush borders.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and son of bibliophilePhilip the Good, saw many of his father's unfinished book commissions through to completion; this prayer book is one of the rare commissions Charles initiated himself. The accounts of the Burgundian dukes record payments in 1469 to the scribe Nicholas Spierinc of Ghent, to theilluminatorLieven van Lathem of Antwerp, and to the goldsmith who made the original clasps for the binding of this costly book. Along with Lathem, several anonymous illuminators collaborated on this project, including the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy. In the 1480s, a series of additional prayers with miniatures by a French illuminator was added to the volume.
In this luxurious personalprayer book, even the usually plain pages of text are decorated. The scribe Nicolas Spierinc elegantly copied the text of the prayer toSaint Sebastianthat begins on this page, with his pen flourishes extending into the margins. The ornament on the upper right springs from the ascending line of a letterbin the text. Such a letter, flourished with wide parallel pen strokes and occasional cross strokes, is known as acadelle.Spierinc elegantly played with the varying widths of the strokes, using wider bands for the verticals and diagonals but maintaining the horizontal strokes as thinner lines. He used modeling on the leaf growing within the flourish to give it a three-dimensional effect.Thedrolleries, fantastic figures and whimsical beasts cavorting in the margins, further enliven this page of text. As is common, they do not seem to relate to the theme of the text they garnish. In the space between the winged femalecentaurwith a bow and arrow and the dragon she battles, a simple but elegant pen flourish stems from theD,the decorated first initial of the text.
Mostbooks of hours, privateprayer booksspecifically designed for lay people, contain a calendar, theHours of the Virgin, a standard series of readings from the Gospels, theOffice for the Dead, thePenitential Psalms, prayers, and hymns. This particular book of hours contains all those texts. Remarkably, it also includes other texts, both biblical passages and special prayers, focused on thePassion of Christ. The book'silluminationfeatures a number ofminiaturesshowing scenes from Jesus' Passion.Not only were books of hours important in the spiritual lives of their owners, but the most beautifully and extensively illuminated ones were important luxury objects. This one was illuminated by two anonymous artists, the most accomplished of whom is known as the Spitz Master. The two artists all painted in theInternational style, characterized by the courtly elegance of the figures and richly patterned fabrics rendered in brilliant colors and gold. Some of this book's miniatures were adapted from illuminations made by theLimbourg BrothersforJean, duc de Berry, the most famous artpatronof the age.
The gracefulminiatureof the Way to Calvary by the Spitz Master introduces the Passion story from theGospelof Saint John. Amidst elegantly dressed soldiers and his followers,Jesuscarries his cross through Jerusalem's city gate. He is barefoot but wears a fine robe trimmed in gold thread. The face of his mother, theVirgin Mary, standing beneath the city gate, echoes his sad expression. Far in thebackground,Judashangs himself. This small image enriches thenarrativeby referring to an earlier event, Judas'betrayal, that led eventually to theCrucifixion. The pairing of this miniature with the Passion reading from the Gospels encourages the reader to envision and sympathize with Jesus in his suffering. The inclusion of expensive materials, includingburnishedsilver and goldhighlights, and the figures' exquisite costumes, dance-like movements, and tender expressions all epitomize the refinement and elegance of theInternational styleassociated with court art of the early 1400s.
Saint Christopherwas a man of great size and strength who devoted himself toJesusby helping travelers cross a dangerous river. One day a child asked to ride on Christopher's shoulders across the river, but the infant seemed to grow heavier and heavier with every step. When they arrived on the opposite shore, the child identified himself asChrist, telling the holy man that he had just carried the weight of the world. Saint Christopher became one of the most popularpatronsaints for travelers in the Middle Ages.In thebook of hoursby the Spitz Master, theminiatureof this scene precedes anintercessory prayerto Saint Christopher. The miniature is characterized by an intimate, even playful quality. As the saint gently grasps Jesus' foot, the child tenderly clasps the saint's hair in a gesture that underscores Jesus' humanity. In the miniature's border are scenes from the life of Saint Christopher.With a high horizon line that flattens out the long and distant vista, the handling of the image is typical of theInternational style. The silvery, turbulent river extends deeply to the far horizon, while the boats' full sails give the miniature a lively character.
TheminiatureofSaint Catherine of Alexandriatended by angels opens thesuffrageto the saint in this luxuriouslyilluminatedbook of hours. According to the legends describing her life, Emperor Maxentius had Catherine beaten and then imprisoned without food or water for twelve days because of her refusal to worship pagan idols. During this ordeal, angels comforted and fed her. The crowned woman who enters Catherine's chamber on the left is Maxentius' wife, who, upon seeing the ministering angels, converts toChristianity. In bothcompositionand style, this miniature is related to one in theBelles Heuresof the Duke of Berry, illuminated by the celebratedLimbourg brothers.Key episodes of Catherine's life are shown within the border's colorful foliage.
TheNativityminiatureopensPrimeof theHours of the Virgin, the customary position for this subject inbooks of hours. The text begins with a verse fromPsalm69,Deus in adiutorium meu[m] intende(God, come to my assistance). The anonymous artist known as the Spitz Master represented theVirgin MaryandJosephkneeling in adoration before the babyJesus, who is encircled by seraphim. Two shepherds humbly positioned behind a shed also kneel before the child. Above, surrounded by angels, God the Father raises his hand in blessing as rays of light fall on the child below. This holy group is contrasted with the figures worshipping a heathenidolin the distant landscape. The Spitz Master drew his basiccompositionfrom a Nativity miniature in a book of hours by theLimbourg Brothers, but he added to this the legend of the midwifeSalome, who kneels behind the Virgin. She questioned the virgin birth of Jesus, and when she sought to examine Mary to test her doubts, her hands shriveled. Upon her recognition of Jesus as theMessiah, her hands were restored. The Spitz Master added a flying angel returning Salome's hands to her.
In theHours of the Virginin thisbook of hours, theVespersservice opens with aminiatureof theFlight into Egypt. In brilliant, jewel-like colors,Josephleads Mary on a donkey to escape the cruelHerod, King of Judea, who had decreed the death of all newborn male children in an effort to destroy the newbornChristChild. Theilluminatorportrayed theHoly Familyjourneying through a hilly landscape with Herod's men in pursuit. Peeking over the horizon at the left, their enormous heads dwarf their surroundings. The exaggerated scale of the soldiers contributes to the sense of danger and enchantment in the Holy Family's escape.Within the fleshy fronds and fine sprays of leaves in the border, the illuminator shows the Miracle of the Wheat Field. The apocryphal legend recounts that after the Holy Family passed a worker sowing wheat in the fields as they fled to Egypt, the wheat miraculously grew to full term overnight. A short time later, when the pursuing soldiers asked the farmer if he had seen the Holy Family, he replied that they had passed by when he was sowing. The soldiers incorrectly assumed that the Holy Family had passed by months before and so gave up their search.
In theminiatureof theDeposition, theVirgin Mary,Joseph of Arimathea,Nicodemus, and Jesus' other followers stand and kneel in a shallow, stagelike space before a flat, textile-patternedbackgroundwhose richness contributes to the image's ceremonial quality. The miniature introduces a verse meditation on the Virgin's experience of theCrucifixion, the moving prayer known from its opening lines as theStabat Mater.Arranged symmetrically aroundJesus, his followers lower his crucified body from the cross. In concert they present his limp, lifeless form to the viewer as an object for veneration. Despairing angels in the borders grieve over Christ's death.The artist's inclusion ofnaturalisticeffects counters the artifice of the theatricalcomposition. He enveloped the figures in voluminous draperies that fall to the ground in heavy folds suggesting bodymass. The artist transmitted a sense of the weight of Jesus' dead body by depicting its effect on the figure in green on the right, who buckles under the strain as he tries to support it.
These elegant figures dressed in colorful robes, some flecked with gold, are characteristic of theInternational Gothicstyle of the early 1400s. Gherardo Starnina, formerly known as the  Master of the Bambino Vispo (Master of the Lively Child), painted this panel in Florence, where he settled after a sojourn in Spain. His nickname refers to his penchant for painting Madonnas with a squirming or livelyChristChild, as in this painting.The Madonna sits on an ornate throne surrounded by angels, some in attitudes of worship, others playing musical instruments and singing. Christ sits on her lap, twisting his body in order to touch the lilies, a symbol of purity offered by an angel. In his left hand he holds a goldfinch, alluding to hisCrucifixion.Starnina's scene is rich in detail, color, and materials.Gold leafis used for the haloes, the trim of clothing and furniture, and the background. The gold of the Virgin's crown and the angel's garments and haloes are punchmarked to create lavish designs. Starnina delighted in portraying sumptuous effects, seen in the brocade covering the chair and Mary's gown, the simulated marble footstool, and the decoratively patterned floor.
A peasant family sits around a wooden table in a Dutch kitchen. The room's exposed rafters, assorted domestic objects on shelves, and cobbled floor are all rendered in careful detail. A woman serves a man who blows on his soup to cool it. A young child faces her, holding a spoon in his upraised hand and begging for food. A lively young woman wearing a large straw hat and an old woman fill the space between the eating man and the standing woman. A crude fellow in the background spoons soup into his grinning mouth. Next to the open door, a satyr leans on a staff and points an admonishing finger at the peasant family. The satyr has noticed that the peasant blows both on his hands to warm them and on his soup to cool it. He will turn to leave the house because he cannot trust someone who blows  both hot and cold with the same breath. The artist Jan Steen painted this subject, known originally from Aesop'sFables,many times. Throughout the 1600s, this moralistic tale was a popular subject for Dutch and Flemish painters.
In this allegory of the status of the artist and the nature of his profession, a male artist instructs two pupils: a young boy and a fashionably dressed young woman. A plaster cast of a sculpture of a nude male seems to be the object of the day's exercise in how to draw, but the studio is filled with many other props and materials.On the table are pens, brushes, charcoal pencils, and a woodcut depicting the head of an old man. Several plaster casts hang from a shelf that supports a sculpture of an ox, the symbol of Saint Luke, the patron saint of painters. A plaster putto is suspended from the ceiling in front of a tapestry, which is draped to reveal an easel with a painting and a violin hung on the wall. In the foreground a stretched canvas leans on a chest heaped with a bound album and a carpet. Objects related to the traditional theme ofvanitas(vanity), a frequent subject of Dutch still lifes, are piled in the lower right corner. These items--a laurel wreath, a skull, wine, a fur muff, a book, a lute, and a pipe--remind viewers of the brevity of life and fame.
Bathsheba stares brazenly out at the viewer while a maidservant trims her toenails. King David, who saw her beauty and desired her, sent her a summons to appear at his palace. Although she was married, Bathsheba was forced to comply.A popular subject, artists often portrayed Bathsheba as distraught about her dilemma. Here, Jan Steen depicted her as a temptress, rather than the innocent victim of the king's passion. In this moralizing painting, Steen commented on the foolishness of human behavior.Bathsheba's robe is casually arranged to reveal her breast and bare legs. The shoe in the right foreground symbolizes lasciviousness; the fountain on the left probably alludes to female fecundity. She is so lost in her thoughts that she holds King David's note loosely in her right hand and pays no attention to the small dog or to the old woman grasping her shoulder.
In the dimly lit crypt of a church, two soldiers lie sleeping on either side of a chest. A single candle lights the vaulted interior, illuminating the arches and the square tiles of the stone floor. Another flame glimmers weakly, visible through a darkened archway in the background and casting a small glow over a staircase. Hendrick van Steenwijck employed these contrasts of light and darkness to play with the viewer's sense of perspective. Using strongchiaroscuro,he guided the viewer's eye around the scene, from the brilliant glow of the column and ceiling in the middle, back through the arch to the stairs, and finally to the dark interior beyond.Various gradations of light also emphasize the room's tones and textures. Candlelight shows off the joins in the masonry, as well as the cracks in the ceiling, the wood panels in the door, and the gleaming folds of the guard's cloak.
Holding a painter's palette in his left hand and a paintbrush in his right and wearing a smock that belonged to the photographer Fred Holland Day, Edward Steichen created a boldly assertive self-portrait. Although Steichen was still active as a painter when he made the photograph, the image also implies that the photographer's craft is equal to that of the traditional artist.Using a gum bichromate process served to heighten the painterly effect of this photograph, creating a soft-focus, grainy image that did not resemble the sharp-focus prints that were more popularly favored. The overall darkness of the print heightens the picture's drama, while the contrasting highlight areas of shirt collar and brush tip create a tonal balance within the composition. Standing in three-quarter pose, the young photographer appears poised for certain artistic ascendancy, his taut grip on the paintbrush reinforcing the sense of purpose.
In addition to recording dances for posterity, photographs extended the celebrity of individual dancers. The famous burlesque artist Gypsy Rose Lee was especially aware of photography's value as a public relations tool. A friend of Ralph Steiner's, Lee commissioned him to make this photograph as part of a series of publicity shots.On a rural road in the Bronx, Lee posed wearing a shimmering, sequined gown and fur, flanked by a Rolls Royce and Louis Vuitton luggage and surrounded by her spectacularly costumed  girls.  Lee's elegant presentation gives no hint that her costume weighed over seventy pounds or that the day was hot and her makeup took two hours to apply.
Reclining with her arms crossed, this female figure is typical of the sculpture of the Cyclades in the mid-2000s B.C. Scholars have dividedCycladicsculpture into groups or types indicating stylistic and chronological developments. Named for a cemetery on the island of Naxos, the Spedos type was the most common of Cycladic figures: a slender elongated female with folded arms characterized by a U-shaped head and a deeply incised, but not cut-through, cleft between the legs. The figure's relaxed, slanting feet indicate her reclining position. This late example of a Spedos figure shows the further characteristic trait of a straight profile with little bend in the knees. This piece is unusually large and finely carved for a late Spedos figure.
Despite its rustic subject matter, this highly finished drawing displays many elements of the classicizing style of French art, which Jacques Stella absorbed during his close association with Nicolas Poussin in Rome. Stella lined up the figures in a loose, friezelike fashion, allowing the composition almost to be  read  from left to right. The calm, somewhat static effect and the shallow space, in which depth is cut off by the large trees and ladders, also characterize the classicizing style.Stella probably made this drawing to be transferred to a plate for printing; indentations can be found across the sheet, and its verso is covered with red chalk. Although no prints of this image are known, Stella probably made this drawing in preparation for a print by Claudine Bouzonnet Stella, his niece, pupil, and engraver.
Grete Stern made this engaging portrait of her later business partner Ellen Auerbach, nicknamed  Pit,  in 1929, when they were both art students in Berlin. Auerbach, then twenty-three years old, appears as a modern woman with bobbed hair, meeting the viewer's gaze head-on. The combination of the overheadperspectiveand the use of close-up, as well as the graphic patterning of Auerbach's clothing and thebackground, positions this image as a progressive portrait of one of a new breed of urban women who were moving away from traditional female roles.
A shining white trailer home floats out of place on a sea of rolling desert hills. Joel Sternfeld's large, tripod-mountedview cameragave him a cool, detached viewpoint, letting him describe the scene in relentless detail. His detachment highlights the uneasy relationship between humans and nature that informs many pictures in hisAmerican Prospectsseries.
In this image from Joel Sternfeld'sAmerican Prospectsseries, a corralled white horse in Page, Arizona regards the camera with an unnervingly human attention. Since 1978, Sternfeld has undertaken many photographic expeditions across the United States, focusing on the rural landscape and creating a photographic portrait of America often described as ironic.
Malice Green's death in 1992 after a police beating at this Detroit street corner fueled ongoing public outrage in the United States over police brutality. In 1993 Joel Sternfeld began a photographic series documenting the locations of such nationally publicized crimes, sometimes years after they had occurred. Building on the power of memory in the experience of landscape, Sternfeld's series recalls the work of Civil War photographers who returned, well after the war, to the sites of important battles. Cleared of bodies and other visual evidence, both groups of photographs mix elements of landscape, memorial, and document.
Dwarfed by the trees and stumps, woodcutters emerge from a thick forest in the Bohemian countryside around Prague. Pieter Stevens's art was heavily influenced by his many years in Bohemia as court painter to Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II of Prague. Well aware of Gillis van Coninxloo's imaginary, close-up forest scenes, Stevens creatively used a similar composition to depict a realistic setting. The steeply pitched roofs and towers of the picturesque city appeared often in Stevens' work; though not definitively identified, they resemble those of Prague.Characteristically, Stevens enlivened this scene with reddishwashhighlights in the trees and blue wash in the sky. His flexible pen strokes and broad areas of wash lend the view an atmospheric quality.
From 1893 to 1895 I often walked the streets of New York downtown, near the East River, taking my hand camera with me. . . . [One day] I found myself in front of the old Post Office. . . . It was extremely cold. Snow lay on the ground. A driver in a rubber coat was watering his steaming car horses.Though many of Alfred Stieglitz's early photographs relied heavily upon atmosphere to mute the harshness of urban life, he romanticized nothing in this image. At the southern end of the Harlem streetcar line that traveled up and down Fifth Avenue, he simply captured a streetcar driver watering his horses in front of the old Post Office.At the time, Stieglitz had just returned from Germany and found America culturally barren in comparison. According to one anecdote, when he saw the horses being nourished by their driver, he decided that he should assume the same role and nourish the arts in this country. Within a few years, Stieglitz was organizing pioneering exhibitions of painting, photography, and sculpture in his modest galleries.
Alfred Stieglitz wrote of this wintry urban scene:I found myself in front of the old Post Office. The Third Avenue street railway and the Madison Avenue car systems had their terminals there, opposite the old Astor House. It was extremely cold. Snow lay on the ground. A driver in a rubber coat was watering his steaming car horses. How fortunate the horses seemed, having a human being to tend them. The steaming horses being watered on a cold winter day, the snow-covered streets...[expressed]my own sense of loneliness in my own country.Recently returned from nearly a decade in Europe, Stieglitz found not only his subject matter on the streets of New York but also an emotional relationship with the city's anonymity and alienation. This photograph, with its physically tight spaces and faceless inhabitants, expressed Stieglitz's mood in somber tones.
A locomotive engine steams toward the camera on its barely visible tracks, wearing a billowing black cloud of smoke like a plumed hat. The criss-crossing lines of tracks beside it snake off toward the horizon, and the telephone poles at the left appear to be making the same march. Alfred Stieglitz's composition is a treatise on the importance of the machine in the modern Industrial Age. The title of the photograph,The Hand of Man, sets up a comparison between the machine that is depicted and the human artistic impulse that created the image. Stieglitz reproduced this photograph in the January 1903 issue ofCamera Work, a journal that he both founded and edited. In the early 1930s he returned to the image and printed additional photographs.

There were men, women and children on the lower level of the steerage....The scene fascinated me: A round straw hat; the funnel leaning left, the stairway leaning right; the white drawbridge, its railings made of chain; white suspenders crossed on the back of a man below; circular iron machinery; a mast that cut into the sky, completing a triangle. I stood spellbound for a while. I saw shapes related to one another--a picture of shapes, and underlying it, a new vision that held me...Twenty-five years after making this photograph, Alfred Stieglitz recalled the moment in vivid detail, no doubt aided by the information provided within the frame. He had wandered down from the first-class deck to survey the jumbled scene of teeming passengers in the steerage, or economy class, section, which contrasted sharply with  the mob called the 'rich'  that he had left behind. Stieglitz's compressed composition emphasized the closeness of space and bustling conditions in the steamer's lower-level accommodations.
All I know about myself is that I am an honest workman.--And that good workmanship is ever a passion with me.--And as I age the passion becomes more intense. Borders on mania.Alfred Stieglitz wrote this description of himself to a friend in 1920. Can that self-portrait in words be reconciled with the photographic self-portrait of a younger Stieglitz, made thirteen years earlier in his career  Here he appears as an intense, determined man, possibly passionate but hardly manic. The intensity of his bespectacled gaze, a metaphor for his visionary career, suggests the skill that he described and that he applied to his trade.Some twenty years after he made the negative, Stieglitz still thought this photograph faithfully portrayed him; he then made this print as a gift for his wife, the painter Georgia O'Keeffe.
[Georgia O'Keeffe] is much more extraordinary than even I had believed--In fact I don't believe there has ever been anything like her--Mind and feeling very clear--spontaneous--& uncannily beautiful--absolutely living every pulse beat.Early in Alfred Stieglitz's relationship with O'Keeffe he wrote this adulatory description of her to a friend. Stieglitz made this expressive study of O'Keeffee's nearly dancing hands and her torso, dressed in a crisp black dress with a sheer, voile shawl collar, reminiscent of the one she wore when they first met at his gallery. O'Keeffe, by then already an accomplished painter, expressed herself eloquently through her hands, and Stieglitz recognized their emotive potential.
 My hands had always been admiredbut I never though much about it,  recalled Georgia O'Keeffe when she looked at this photograph some sixty years after it was made. As part of the consuming passion for O'Keeffe that drove Alfred Stieglitz to leave his first wife and child, he conducted a great love affair with her hands through his camera. From the very beginning of their relationship, Stieglitz photographed O'Keeffe, eventually produced a cumulative portrait of more than 325 photographs.Here photographed so that only her hands are visible, the dynamism of her gesture evokes the rhythms of music and dance as well as the abstract, biomorphic shapes of O'Keeffe's own drawings and paintings.
During the first decades of the twentieth century, Stieglitz was the undisputed leader of the idea that a photograph could be art. He made more than three hundred photographs of the painter Georgia O'Keeffe between 1917 and 1937, focusing on various parts of her body--head, breasts, hands, and torso. These intimate pictures express something of O'Keeffe's spirit while reflecting Stieglitz's love for his art and his muse.
A striking figure in a smart hat, seductively open white shirt, and black jacket, Georgia O'Keeffe stands in front of one of her paintings and clutches at her breasts as if her hands contain a life force unto themselves. Her penetrating gaze above the camera transports her to a space the viewer cannot share.From 1917 through the mid-1930s, Alfred Stieglitz photographed O'Keeffe, with whom he began a passionate relationship in 1918. He called the extended series of photographs he made of herGeorgia O'Keeffe: A Portrait.
This double exposure of the face and leg of Dorothy True constitutes an unusual portrait. Her somewhat somber face, very faint, is not immediately apparent, but slowly a mouth, nose, and eye begin to reveal themselves in the black-stockinged ankle and calf. Alone, the image of the leg is an interesting one; her foot appears veritably stuffed into her stylish, patent leather pump. Her instep bulges out of the top of the shoe, and the leather ripples from the pressure at the toe, making the foot an almost sculptural form.True appears to step down upon overturned prints or mats. A chair casts a graphic shadow across the floor, and a vertical paper backdrop echoes the black shadow at the upper left, uncovered by the sagging paper. The neat triangle of True's skirt lends additional geometric balance.
The camera always stood near the wall-a box maybe a foot square and four or five inches thick. It stood on its rickety tripod with the black head cloth over it-a bit worn with much use-maybe a bulb hanging down on a small rubber cord. Beside the camera was folded a dirty white umbrella that was a large white circle when opened. ... These things were always around nearby so he could grab them...-Georgia O'KeeffeGeorgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz shared a New York City apartment where he likely made this photograph of her. Many of his early portraits of O'Keeffe-like this one made two years after they became a couple-reflect their passion for each other. Stieglitz launched O'Keeffe's career by exhibiting her paintings and drawings at his New York gallery, 291. Eventually they married, and he continued making portraits of her throughout their lives together.This image displays a degree of eroticism as O'Keeffe's hands-with palms facing the camera-look as if they are about to squeeze a round shape in herDrawing No. 17. This  portrait  of O'Keeffe was considered highly unconventional at the time. It is like others in the series, most of which are close-ups of her body, often with one of her abstract works of art serving as a background. The figure and background seem to blend seamlessly, forming an image that borders on abstraction.
Stieglitz began photographing his wife, Georgia O'Keeffe, shortly after they met in 1917. More than three hundred photographs made over a period of twenty years trace the evolution of the couple's intimate and artistic relationship. O'Keeffe once wrote:  Stieglitz had a very sharp eye for what he wanted to say with the camera. When I look over the photographs Stieglitz took of me--some of them more than sixty years ago--I wonder who that person is. It is as if in my one life I have lived many lives. If the person in the photographs were living in the world today, she would be quite a different person--but it doesn't matter--Stieglitz photographed her then. 
When Alfred Stieglitz began to photograph clouds, he wrote to a friend:  I had told Miss [Georgia] O'Keeffe I wanted a series of photographs which when seen by [composer] Ernest Bloch he would exclaim: Music! music! Man, why that is music!  In 1922, amidst significant personal changes, Stieglitz created his first series of cloud studies, alternately titledMusic: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs;Clouds in Ten Movements;andMusic: A Series of Ten Pictures. These images were a precursor to Stieglitz's  Equivalents  series, in which he sought to depict emotional states through visual representations.This foreboding landscape with its dominating, brooding black sky evokes the personal, familial tumult then occurring in Stieglitz's life.
Stieglitz, a great promoter of Modernism in America and an advocate of photography as art, began pointing his camera skyward in 1922. His images of evanescent clouds were meant to express his own fleeting emotional states and reflect the dynamism of a world in constant flux. Originally Stieglitz titled them  songs of the sky,  but he later came to call them  equivalents of my most profound life experience.  The works focus on abstract qualities of proportion, rhythm, and harmony, presenting pure form as music for the eye.
Lolling in a chair under a large, shady tree, this robust fellow may have been employed to help out around Alfred Stieglitz's upstate New York summer home. In the fall of 1922, Stieglitz and his siblings inherited the family property on Lake George, near the Adirondacks. The relaxed atmosphere of the retreat led to the creation of some of Stieglitz's most informal photographs. Thanks to his social invitations, this picturesque region with the lake, grassy fields, and chestnut trees soon became a vacation destination for many of his fellow artists.
This middle-aged, as-yet-unidentified sitter wears the relatively unadorned costume of a burgher. A doublet buttons up his front to a high, ruffled collar. As interiors were poorly heated at this time, it became the fashion to keep hats on indoors as well as out, so a low, soft bonnet covers his head.After lightly outlining the form in black chalk, Tobias Stimmer drew in the face and beard in pen and brown ink and finally worked over the entire figure in black ink. His bold, fractured hatching lends a powerful sculptural quality to the hands. In the face, his strong linework, working together with the luminosity of the white of the paper, produces a powerful, forthright expression. The eyes, with their large, arresting irises, are particularly striking. Scholars assume that the drawing was made as an independent work of art as they can identify no existing painting or prints.
This aged and emaciated figure is the blind general Belisarius. Heavy eyelids almost completely cover his eyes, which register nothing of the outside world. Deeply set eye sockets, encircled by wrinkles, also draw attention to Belisarius's blindness. His veined and wrinkled forehead, tilted head, and open mouth, emphasize his vulnerable state.In the mid-1700s, a novel by Jean-Franois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius--a popular general of theRoman Empirewhose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for painters and sculptors--including Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Franois Grard (whose paintingBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).Jean-Baptiste Stouf exhibited this marble sculpture at theSalonof 1791; he had previously shown aterracottamodel of thebustof Belisarius in 1785. Like many eighteenth-century artists who depicted Belisarius, Stouf emphasized the subject's pathos, highlighting the injustice of the general's plight. The intimate and sympathetic portrait also demonstrates Stouf's mastery of marble carving. The luxuriantly sculpted beard and cascading curls of hair, the crumpled, crinkled skin, and the broad, high brow are all captured with a subtlety that belies the challenge of carving stone. The formal characteristics of Belisarius echoclassicalandBaroquesculpture but also anticipate theRomanticsensibility of the 1800s.
In this idyllic scene of fishermen working on the Arno River in Florence at low tide, Stradanus carefully depicted important Florentine monuments such as the Campanile, the Florence Cathedral, and the Palazzo Vecchio. The realistic setting reveals his Netherlandish roots in the close attention to naturalistic and topographical details. The crowded composition and exaggerated, often twisting, movements of the figures reveal the Mannerist influence of Stradanus's years in Florence.Stradanus changed his mind about the compositional details and replaced the lower center of the drawing, inserting more fishermen and a reclining river god in the center foreground. With an urn and a horn of plenty, the river god serves as a personification of the Arno, the river that bisects Florence.Stradanus probably made this sheet as part of a series of hunting and fishing scenes commissioned by Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. The designs, most of which were later engraved, were intended for tapestries to decorate the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano, but only a few tapestries were ever woven. Artisans later copied this scene in a stucco relief in the courtyard of another Florentine palace.
Paul Strand's sharply focused image shows New York City nearly unencumbered by pedestrian or automotive traffic. In the foreground, spindly, leafless trees line up against massive apartment buildings. The same year this photograph was made, Strand exhibited his work at 291, a gallery operated by Alfred Stieglitz. An influential pioneer in the effort to elevate photography to the status of art, Stieglitz described Strand's work as  brutally direct, devoid of all flim-flam, devoid of trickery and of any  'ism.'   These photographs,  he stated,  are the direct expression of today. Strand made this photograph shortly after becoming acquainted with Stieglitz and the Photo-Secessionist movement. The clarity of this image illustrates how deeply Stieglitz influenced Strand. Prior to their meeting, Strand's work was in the soft-focus style of Pictorialism.
I was in Connecticut, and the simplest of subject matter, or maybe object matter would be a better term in this case--such as kitchen bowls, cups, plates, pieces of fruit, a table, a chair, the railing of the porch, the shadows of the railing of the porch--things as simple as that were my material for making experiments to find out what an abstract photograph might be, and to understand what an abstract painting really was.Thus Paul Strand recalled in 1971 the approach he took to create abstract images more than fifty years earlier. This still life configuration of dishes and fruit becomes a formal composition of arcs and curves. The objects transcend their everyday function to become lines and shapes defined by the dramatic lighting.
Pointing his camera up and tilting the frame resulted in this dynamic study of architecture and sky made by Paul Strand during a summer retreat to Twin Lakes, Connecticut. The edges of the roof, pillar, and porch railing that enter the frame at the top barely resemble their functional form; instead they are neatly transformed into triangle, parallelogram, and line. By contrast, the natural shapes of cumulus and cirrus cloud formations fill the sky, balancing the human-made geometric forms in both tone and texture.
I suddenly got the idea of making portraits of people the way you see them in New York parks-sitting around, not posing, not conscious of being photographed. People involved in the process of daily living. So wrote Paul Strand of a series of images he made early in his career. This photograph was made in New York City's Washington Square Park.Photographed without her knowledge by the use of a fake lens mounted on the side of his camera and front to disguise his attention, the anonymous woman appears slightly off center. Her sad, introspective expression echoes in every furrowed line on her weathered face. The delicate decoration of her hat and the satiny shimmer of her scarf help soften the aging that dramatically marks her countenance.
I remember coming across Paul Strand'sBlind Womanwhen I was very young, and that really bowled me over. . . . It's a very powerful picture. I saw it in the New York Public Library file ofCamera Work, and I remember going out of there over stimulated: That's the stuff, that's the thing to do. It charged me up.--Walker EvansThe impact of seeing this striking image for the first time is evident in Walker Evans's vivid recollection. At the time, most photographers were choosing  pretty  subjects and creating fanciful atmospheric effects in the style of theImpressionists. Paul Strand's unconventional subject and direct approach challenged assumptions about the medium.At once depicting misery and endurance, struggle and degradation, Strand's portrait of a blind woman sets up a complex confrontation.  The whole concept of blindness,  as one historian has noted,  is aimed like a weapon at those whose privilege of sight permits them to experience the picture. . . . 
The photographer's problem is to see clearly the limitations and at the same time the potential qualities of his medium, for it is precisely here that honesty no less than intensity of vision is the prerequisite of a living expression. This means a real respect for the thing in front of him expressed in terms of chiaroscuro...So wrote Paul Strand two years before he made this negative of a black bottle sitting in a white sink. Through the manipulation of light and dark tones, Strand transformed this ordinary subject matter. The four overflow drain holes become graphic markings in the upper left, while the muted gray shadow cast by the bottle assumes an almost-human form against the porcelain. The diagonals of light that illuminate the scene appear like radiant beams.
In 1921 Paul Strand married the painter Rebecca Salsbury. During the early years of their marriage, he photographed her frequently, making this intimate portrait of her in 1923. It is a close-up study of her peaceful, sleeping face, her chin resting gently on her bare shoulder against the white bed linen. The folds and curves of her flesh are softened in the even lighting that bathes her skin, while the claustrophobically close cropping emphasizes her form and at the same time diminishes her more individual features.
The Akeley [movie camera] was assuredly the chief stimulus to my active interest in the machineI photographed lathes, milling machines, drillers, etc., etc., made in the shops of the Akeley Camera Company.Thus Paul Strand described the making of this photograph. In 1922, having collaborated the year before with Charles Sheeler on a film of the urban high-rise environment in New York City, Strand purchased an Akeley camera.  It's really a piece of craftsmanship different from anything our friend George Eastman makes,  enthused Strand, comparing his new ninety-pound machine to the still cameras made popular by Eastman, who is credited with having invented the first snapshot camera. This photograph of a machine that helped construct Strand's movie camera is an homage to the physical beauty and visual power of technology.
 I became interested in photographing some of the last vestiges of what was the frontier in America,  wrote Paul Strand of photographing in New Mexico. Here he transformed the adobe church of Ranchos de Taos in northern New Mexico into an abstract sculpture dominating the frame, its pure, clean lines and surfaces like hand-wrought building blocks. Each wall face is a different shade of gray, determined by the intense and even light that falls on the building from the right. The dramatic, stormy-looking sky barely visible along the top portends future trouble for this serene scene. The sparse vegetation and cracks in the corner foundation serve to establish some sense of scale and to ground the otherworldly form in a real space.
Paul Strand viewed Mexico's rural buildings as cultural and historical icons. In this image of a church, Strand created a study in mass, volume, light, and shadow. While one side of the building is bathed in light, the massive rear wall remains almost entirely obscured. Two small conical structures are affixed to the rear corners. At the far end of the main building, a bell tower stands, surmounted by a cross. A mysterious block, perhaps a chapel, juts out from the main building, unrelieved by doors or windows. For Stand, this stark and weathered church may have embodied both the material residue of colonial times and the everyday reality of Mexico's rural communities.
Paul Strand's 1940 portfolio,Photographs of Mexico, included this image of a humble, careworn Christ, outfitted with hair and adorned in velvet. Made outside Mexico City, the painted sculpture constituted a sophisticated example of indigenous craftsmanship. For Strand, the deity was alive with the striving faith of the artisans who created the piece.By isolating the figure, Strand focused on a topic that was relevant to the contemporary viewer: the working man's daily struggle to attain redemption.
 I have, as you know, the greatest respect and affection for you and your work. It is the only truly poetic photography in the world today. In a letter to Paul Strand, Ansel Adams expressed his admiration for the aesthetic and technical expertise that Strand used to endow images likeVillage, Tlaxcala, Mexicowith meaning. In this photograph, Strand explored the interplay of light and geometry in a village outside Mexico City. The white walls and pitched, shingle roof provide various angles and textures, while dark doorways impart a sense of mystery. The empty, seemingly abandoned town square appears both secretive and timeless. In creating this study of Mexico's vernacular architecture, Strand also disclosed the harsh realities of village life.
Recognized many appealing qualities in Mexico's indigenous people, Paul Strand stated that he liked  to photograph people who have strength and dignity in their faces; whatever life has done to them, it hasn't destroyed them.  With her feet tucked under her, the woman in this photograph sits on the ground, waiting for customers to purchase the carefully laid-out produce. beside her. By isolating and closely framing the subject, Strand endow her with a sculptural quality.Strand had shown interest in American native populations as early as 1922, when he applied for government funds to make educational films at Indian reservations in the Southwest. That project was not approved, however. It wasn't until his trip to Mexico, ten years later, that Strand was able to work with a somewhat insular population like the one in the Patzcuaro town of Michoacan. There, Mexican government sponsorship allowed him access to indigenous people, who were typically reticent with outsiders.
Paul Strand arrived in Mexico in late 1932, abandoning his  usual working methods at the border.  No longer subscribing to the popular precept that  you can't make a portrait unless you know that person,  Strand began making photographs of Mexico's native population. In this expressive image, a man in tattered clothing rests his head against a crumbling wall, with his eyes closed and his arm partially hiding his face. The burden of generations of labor and sorrow appears to overwhelm him. Without knowing the man personally, Strand managed to capture an iconic subject, whose dignity and vulnerability combined to reveal the hardship of village life.
During the 1930s, Paul Strand embarked on an intense period of filmmaking. This image of a barn in southern Quebec is one example of the way in which his still photographs from the period reflect his work in motion pictures.A weathered fence stands immediately in theforeground, and in the distance, a white barn sits on the horizon. The darkened walls of nearby structures draw the eye toward the open space in thebackground, providing an almost telescopic effect. The deliberate juxtaposition of the foreground and background views shows the influence of cinema with its potential for interplay between near and far.
New England has . . . a special meaning for Americans. The land and its people, their cities and towns, their factories and mills, the villages surrounded by farms, the long coast and the sea whipping against it . . . . But there is something more. . . . For here in this region . . . were born many of the thoughts and actions that have shaped America for more than three hundred years.So wrote Paul Strand in the foreword toTime in New England, a book that combined his photographs of the region with texts by New Englanders. Strand was encouraged to undertake this project in 1945 by Nancy Newhall, then acting curator of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He spent a number of years looking for  images of nature and architecture and faces of people that were either part of or related in feeling to [New England's] great tradition. This striking composition--an open doorway and an assortment of everyday objects on a porch--was accompanied by the writings of Henry Adams. Describing life in the country, Adams wrote of  the smell of hot pine-woods and sweet fern in the scorching summer noons; of new-mown hay; of ploughed earth; . . . of stables, barns, [and] cow-yards.  The rich surface details in this image convey the sensuousness that Strand associated with New England's scenery.
In the early 1950s Paul Strand spent six weeks in the rural northern Italian town of Luzzara, located on the Po River. He traveled the countryside with local townsman Valentino Lusetti, whose family Strand photographed arranged across the front of their family home. This group portrait includes Valentino's widowed mother Anna, standing with a solemn expression in the darkened doorway, and four of his brothers: Bruno, Guerrino, Afro, and Nino, none of whom look directly at the camera.The circle and spokes of the bicycle wheel are repeated in the semi-circular paned window above the door and in the half-circle shape seen through the door above Anna's left shoulder, serving as a unifying element of the composition. In 1955 Strand published a book of photographs he made in Luzzara,Un paese(A Village).
The young tailor's apprentice stands against a rough wall, her dark hair and coat standing out against the grainy texture that frames her. She holds a tightly woven, straw hat in front of her, its crown slightly dented. The wide-brimmed hat hides her young working hands, while the wintry bare branches carefully outline her rigid form. In Paul Strand's precise vision, the thicker branch on the right aligns perfectly with the outline of a window at the upper right, a subtle detail that reinforces the elegant geometry of the composition.
The man with the camera was a guest of a hospitable race. His record is of their integrity, of the truth of a pattern of life, seen with the artist's precision.Thus Paul Strand was described in a television profile regarding his 1954 visit to the remote rural community of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides off Scotland's northwest coast.This group portrait of three sweet-faced young girls is a warm and respectful portrayal of the subjects. They pose against a rock, their overcoats buttoned up against the cold while the wind blows their hair. Each child looks in a different direction, with the girl in the center, who looks at the photographer, anchoring the composition with her steady gaze and smile.
A white horse stands out against a dark hillside in this seemingly straightforward landscape photograph. The hills of South Uist--one of the Hebrides islands off the Scottish coast--rise above a rather low horizon line, the cloudy sky encompassing two-thirds of the image.Strand used the horse as a metaphor for heroic survival. At the time the image was made, the horse was replaced by modern machinery and literally put out to pasture--a scene that was repeated all over the British Isles. Provincial existence on the windswept islands was equally threatened during this time as English usurped the traditional Gaelic as the dominant language, and much of the population moved to the mainland.
This large and elaborately molded silver basin depicts episodes from the story ofCleopatra, the legendary queen of Egypt, and the Roman leader, MarcAntony. Perhaps drawing from Plutarch's history, the artist frames the climactic event of Cleopatra committing suicide in the center, within a circularfriezeof the Battle of Actium. The four oval cartouches on the rim represent important events related to Antony: at the top, Antony meetsOctavianand Lepidus on an island in the river Lavinus to form the Triumvirate; on the left, Antony first sees Cleopatra when she arrives on an impressive barge on the river Cydnus; on the bottom, a banquet; and on the right, Antony kills himself.Although the basin's design derives from a sketch by Genoese artist Bernardo Strozzi, the highreliefof the figures, some of whom are modeled almost in the round, theManneristturbulence of the battle scene, and the use of depth andperspectiveindicate the work of a northern European artist, perhaps one fromFlanders. The detail and delicacy of the silverwork of this basin suggest that it was ceremonial rather than functional; it was probably exhibited on a buffet on the most festive occasions.
The tabletop bronze of a lion attacking a horse exhibits a dramatic life and death struggle typical of the intense emotionalism of earlyBaroquesculpture. Both the bronze and itspendant,Lion Attacking a Bull,feature a wild beast, the ferocious lion, attacking a domesticated animal and forcing it to collapse. The artist delighted in the power of the animals, whose muscular contortions express their physical struggle and psychological anguish. InLion Attacking a Horse,the artist emphasized the brutality of the kill, using a circularcompositionto focus attention on the lion's claws tearing through the horse's hide. Animal subjects were extremely popular in the early 1600s and a genre for which the sculptor, Giambologna, was well known.Lion Attacking a Horseis based on a fragmentaryantiquestatue now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome. Many casts of theLion Attacking a Horseare extant; the Museum's bronze is among the highest in quality of those that survive.
As the lion sinks his teeth into the bull's side, the bull falls to his knees, straining his neck to reach his attacker. This sculpture is one of a pair of tabletop bronzes that show a wild beast brutally killing a domesticated animal. Although the pair are based onantiquemodels, the animal subject and intense emotionalism are characteristic of the late 1500s and early 1600s.In a play of space and movement, theManneristsculptor Giambologna arranged the figures' limbs in a circle. Although the piece has a principal frontal view, the animals yield a variety of different views as a spectator walks around the sculpture. The artist endowed the work with vivid details: the graphically rendered skin pulled by the lion's claws, the taut muscles of the bull's legs, and the longer hair on the top of the bull's head, carefully distinguished from the shorter fur around his flared nostrils.After Giambologna sculpted the model, Antonio and or Giovanni Francesco Susini's bronzefoundrycast the sculpture. In his biography of Giambologna, Filippo Baldinucci mentions the pair of animal bronzes, but they may have been cast after Giambologna's death as the Susini continued using his models for many years.
The subject of this tabletop bronze comes from Greek mythology. When theTrojanprince Paris abductedHelen, the beautiful wife ofMenelaus, king ofSparta, and carried her off to the city of Troy, the Greeks responded by mounting an attack on the city, thus beginning theTrojan War. Both the bronze's subject--the Trojan War--and its small-scale format reveal the artist's interest inclassicalculture. The handling of the figures, however, shows the influence of ItalianManneristsculpture of the 1600s. The sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Susini, welded the three nude figures together in an intensely dramaticcomposition. While Paris attempts to carry Helen off, she valiantly struggles against him. Below them a female servant protests. The women twist around the central spiral of Paris's lithe body. Susini arranges the figures as if on a stage; both Paris and Helen turn their faces toward the front. Yet, the spiral composition also encourages the viewer to walk around the piece, offering interesting alternate perspectives. From the sides and back, the details of the figures' exertion are visible: as he sinks his fingers into Helen's yielding flesh, the veins on Paris' hands project and Helen's hair flies loose.

Three winged angels carry aCorinthiancolumn through the clouds. Symbolizing one of the instruments of Christ's Passion, the column represents the pillar against which Christ was flogged.Friedrich Sustris produced this drawing in preparation for a series of  twenty-five etched glass panels that formed the door of a reliquary shrine in the royal chapel of theMunich Residenz. Six of the panels, including this one, show angels with symbols of the Passion. Sustris's drawing style gave clues to aid the craftsman who transformed this image into an etched panel. The dark outlines of the angels and the column would have been carved more deeply into the glass than the lightly drawn edges of the clouds.
This drawing is filled with minute details-most strikingly, the multitude of cherub faces amidst the clouds-and yet it reflects the grandeur of the large altarpiece for which it was made as a preparatory design. The altarpiece was made for the transept of Munich's Jesuit Church of Saint Michael, one of the greatest Counter-Reformation churches in German-speaking lands.As God, angels, and the dove of the Holy Spirit look down from above, the Virgin Mary and Christ child sit atop a throne surrounded by earthly subjects: a cardinal, bishop, and pope on the left, and nobles on the right-including the Duke of Bavaria, who commissioned Friedrich Sustris to oversee the church's design and decoration.Sustris's fine penmanship creates a light and airy atmosphere. Brown ink defines the figures' often-elongated forms over chunky light-gray washes that add some weight to the grounded and floating figures. The ink looks like gold in some areas, contributing an aura of holiness to objects of the Passion presented by the angels. The crown of thorns, cross, and pillar of the flagellation were meant to encourage meditation on Christ's crucifixion. Such lavish displays of iconography throughout the church and exemplified in this drawing expressed a defiant, new Catholicism seeking to convert Protestants.
During an illicit rendezvous with her lover, the Corinthian maiden Dibutade decided to trace his silhouette on the wall of her father's studio. Joseph-Benoit Suve rendered this legend of the invention of drawing in his typically polished drawing technique. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting enhances the theatricality of the scene. The light from a single flame throws large shadows of the lovers' heads onto the wall behind them and creates dark areas under arms and chins, all of which serves to focus attention on their half-lit faces. The same light also highlights the variegated whites on the gathers of Dibutade's toga and the shine of her skin. These carefully observed and skillfully rendered nuances give Suve's drawing a lively quality.Scholars believe that Suve made this drawing as a replica of a similar painting rather than as a preparatory study.
This monumental, sun-drenchedItalianatelandscape was drawn by Herman van Swanevelt while he lived in Rome. Swanevelt contrasted dazzling, luminouswashesof shadow on the left with brilliantly illuminated passages on the right created by the paper's whiteness. Similarly, he devised drama by juxtaposing the hard cragginess of the rock formation in the foreground at left with the soft, fluffy trees beyond.Swanevelt's drawing style is based on that of Cornelis van Poelenburgh and Bartholomeus Breenbergh, and sometimes resembles that of Claude Lorrain, all of whom were northern European artists working in Rome. From them, Swanevelt learned to use light to unify a picture and set a mood. In his drawingThe Arch of Septimius Severus, RomePoelenburgh created similar contrasts of light and shade using wash and the luminosity of the bare, white paper. Swanevelt's style was, in turn, influential; Nicolaes Berchem, for example, imitated Swanevelt's monumental compositions and treatment of the warm Italian sunlight.Scholars are uncertain whether Swanevelt drew this scene outdoors from nature or in the studio.
When Herman van Swanevelt made this highly finished drawing, painters of pastoral themes often populated landscapes with nymphs and satyrs. He included several such vignettes in this landscape. Nymphs and satyrs play with children near a dead tree draped with vines on the left, and a satyr holds up an empty pan in the center as a nymph walks away. On the opposite bank of the river, Swanevelt carefully rendered the specific traits of flora and fauna in typical Dutch fashion.Swanevelt used a subtle technique to draw the viewer's eye into the picture's center: he drew the framing elements at the edges in warm brown ink, while the center opens into brightness. The water and background foliage--delicately rendered in black chalk, palewash, and luminous areas of blank paper--sparkle in the sunlight.
A woman, her thin hair tightly wrapped in a white scarf, looks out at the viewer with teary eyes and a toothless smile. The urban poor of Rome and the peasants of the neighboring countryside inspired Michael Sweerts during his stay in Italy in the mid-1600s. The practice of painting the lower classes was relatively new at the time, and pictures of the poor were often derisivecaricatures. Sweerts, however, treated his subject with compassion, vividly capturing the woman's inner beauty while accurately recording her external appearance: the loose skin, thinning hair, and wart on the left side of her face.Although the painting is highly finished, Sweerts's rich brushwork is evident in alternately blended and separated strokes of different shades, creating a strong sense of three-dimensional form. This brushwork is especially striking in the head scarf and the collar.
Two European men in Middle Eastern dress pose in front of aparapet. The bearded man on the left gestures to the right, while the other man looks in the same direction and holds a cryptic message in Italian:Sig:r mio videte la strade di sa lute per la mano di sweerts(My Lord, see the way to salvation by the hand of Sweerts). The note's meaning and the identity of the two gentlemen have eluded scholars. The two men appear to be individualized portraits, recalling the tradition of friendship portraits so popular in Northern Europe. The refined execution of this painting is typical ofFlemishartist Michael Sweert's late style, practiced when he traveled in India as a missionary.  My Lord,  then, may be addressed to the viewer, encouraging him to listen to Sweerts's preaching. With this double portrait, the artist may be urging the observer to find redemption through his belief in God, just as Sweerts did.
Made in Athens in thered-figure technique, this vase depicts the departure ofTriptolemos, who sits in his winged chariot ready to fly away to teach the secrets of agriculture to mortals. Triptolemos, a mortal himself, was connected with the cult ofDemeter, the goddess of fertility, and with theEleusinian Mysteries, which promised a rewarding afterlife to initiates in the goddess's cult. On this vase gods, goddesses, andpersonificationsconnected with the cult, including Demeter,Kore, andHades, surround Triptolemos. Depictions of Triptolemos's mission were very popular in the early 400s B.C., presumably owing to the popularity of the cult.This type of vase is called adinosor mixing bowl. The Greeks produced a very strong wine, which they drank mixed with water. A dinos would be used at asymposiumor drinking party to mix and serve the diluted wine. The foot or base of this dinos is unusual; dinoi usually had rounded bottoms and were set into a separately formed stand.
In 1867 Carleton Watkins made an expedition to Oregon to obtain photographs of its geology, including the chain of extinct volcanic mountains that cap the coastal range. This view was made from the Washington side of the Columbia River. Even the evidence of a solitary boatman and his cargo does not disturb the landscape's profound serenity, nor does his presence reveal the fact that cultivated farmland and an apple orchard existed nearby. Watkins's image nonetheless portrays a man facing nature at its most grand and overwhelming. The man's boat appears ready to launch into the still, glassy river, an act that will make an indelible imprint on the water's pristine, boundless surface.
At the base of the Columbia River Gorge adjacent to the lower falls, Carleton Watkins positioned his 18 x 22-inch camera so that the lens tilted upward. In so doing, he accommodated both the upper and lower falls, the intriguing trunks of various trees, and the face of the gorge itself. The trees on the right seem to tilt as a result of the camera angle he used. Unlike many of the photographs Watkins took on his 1867 expedition to Oregon, his images of Multnomah Falls contain no sky, no negative space. Surrounded by dense forest, simply finding a good viewpoint of the cascades proved difficult.

At first glance, there appears to be little of interest in this image. Two barely outlined chimneys rise ghostlike from what the title identifies as a rooftop. Looking again at the date of this image makes its significance clearer. Thisphotogenic drawingnegative was made around four years before the invention of photography was announced to the public, when William Henry Fox Talbot was still experimenting with light sensitive chemistry and optical devices.In this instance he used a camera obscura to project the light that was reflected off the building through a lens fitted onto the camera obscura. A piece of light-sensitive paper was taped at the back of the camera obscura. The reflection of the building was registered on the paper, which produced this sketchy negative image of the building. Talbot conducted these light-sensitivity experiments from mid-1834 until the summer of 1835. In early January 1839, he learned about Jacques Louis Mand Daguerre's impending announcement of hisdaguerreotypeprocess in France; two weeks after Daguerre's announcement, Talbot published his invention of the photogenic drawing.
Textiles and plants were the subjects favored by William Henry Fox Talbot's for his earlyphotogenic drawingexperiments. Both were good subjects because of their ability to transmit light and to reveal shapes and patterns according to their density. A textile with a floral pattern, then, must have seemed exceptionally delightful to Talbot's creative and experimental mind.Photogenic drawingsof small objects such as this fraying scrap of linen were made by placing the object on paper that had been made sensitive to light with a combination of silver nitrate and ordinary table salt. The paper with the object on it was then exposed to sunlight. The salt accounts for the image's rich purplish-red color. This photogenic drawing, like most of Talbot's pictures before 1839, is a negative; that is, the actual tones of the object are reversed. One of the earliest photographs in the Getty Museum's collection, it has considerably darkened since the image was made.
On January 25, 1839, in London, William Henry Fox Talbot held the first public display of hisphotogenic drawings. Afterward, he set about perfecting the first negative positive photographic process, thecalotype. Talbot's invention eventually became the basis for photography as it is practiced today.This botanical study resulted from his intensive period of experimentation. Talbot was in correspondence with Sir John Herschel, the preeminent scientist of his day and Talbot's mentor. Talbot created numerous specimen studies that he carefully chronicled and discussed with Herschel. At this stage, Talbot's images were still fairly rudimentary, and almost all were negative images. The splotchy, uneven tones in this image are perhaps the result of the paper not being properly  fixed,  or stabilized. In 1839 Herschel invented  hypo,  a stabilizing fixative bath.
William Henry Fox Talbot was still experimenting with the negative positive process in photography when he made this negative of a painting on glass. Because the painting was on a transparent support, Talbot was able to make a direct-copy negative from it. The background of the negative was darkened with ink so that it would appear light when it was printed as a positive. The Getty Museum owns four negatives and two positives of this image. These multiple variants indicate the usefulness of this glass plate in Talbot's experimentation. They also indicate that this experiment was an important step in Talbot's understanding of the possibilities of the negative positive relationship in photography.
Textiles and plants were the subjects that William Henry Fox Talbot favored for his earlyphotogenic drawingexperiments. Both were good subjects because of their ability to transmit light and to reveal shapes and patterns according to their density. This delicate, balanced botanical specimen is one of Talbot's early experiments with trying to fix, or make permanent, thephotogenic drawingsthat he had begun to produce in 1834. The print was fixed with ordinary table salt, which accounts for its purplish tone.Like most of Talbot's images made before the spring of 1839, this is a negative image. Talbot did not perfect his negative positivecalotypeprocess until 1840, which is perhaps one of the reasons that thedaguerreotypeprocess in France was more immediately popular. Eventually, however, Talbot's invention became more influential because it allowed multiple prints to be made from a single negative.
This image of Lacock Abbey, William Henry Fox Talbot's ancestral home in Wiltshire, England, is a negative, or reversed image. Talbot placed inside hiscamera obscuraa sheet of paper that had been made sensitive to light and fitted the camera with a lens. The light reflected off the subject was projected through the lens into the camera and onto the paper. As the shadows and light hit the paper in direct relation to their densities, the tones were reversed, thus creating a negative.In the introductory remarks toThe Pencil of Nature, published by Talbot from 1844 to 1846 and one of the first books illustrated with photographs, Talbot eloquently and proudly distinguished between traditional art media and the images that he could create by means of this new art:  [T]he plates of this work have been obtained by the mere action of Light upon sensitive paper. They have been formed or depicted by optical and chemical means alone, and without the aid of any one acquainted with the art of drawing.  The statement, however, is not entirely true: Talbot's frustration with his own drafting skills while using thecamera lucidaled him to experiment with chemical means to make the images from these apparatuses permanent.
William Henry Fox Talbot's image of a graceful and heroic oak tree, one of the first images to be fixed with a  hypo  solution, represents a pivotal development in the history of photography. In 1839 Talbot made public his process for fixing images on paper treated with silver chloride. He fixed his original images, however, with a salt that did not actually remove the silver chloride, leaving the image unstable and still sensitive to light. In 1841, the year this picture was taken, he began printing more stable images by using a fixing agent called  hypo,  which thoroughly removed the silver chloride. Although the fuzziness of Talbot's first prints made his images in some ways less pleasing than the exactness of a daguerreotype, the process did allow multiple positive images to be created from a single negative. In this regard, Talbot's discoveries represent the origin of modern photography.
In May 1843 William Henry Fox Talbot went to Paris with his assistant Nicolaas Henneman. A year later, with Talbot's support,  Henneman established the first photographic printing firm in Reading, England. They traveled to France to negotiate the licensing rights for Talbot'scalotypeprocess and to instruct the licensee in its use. This was Talbot's first trip outside of England with his camera, and he was undoubtedly eager to put it to good use.This view outside of an elegant Parisian townhouse shows an active scene. The carriage driver and horses wait curbside, poised to carry passengers to their destination, and the line of arriving and departing carriages rolling across the bottom of the picture suggests a busy boulevard. The calotype's clarity of detail is superb, rivaling that of thedaguerreotype, France's homegrown photographic medium and the calotype's chief competition.
In the text accompanying this image, the second plate in William Henry Fox Talbot'sThe Pencil of Nature, Talbot commented upon the egalitarian nature of photography:  the instrument chronicles whatever it sees, and certainly would delineate a chimney-pot or a chimney-sweeper with the same impartiality as it would theApolloof Belvedere.  Each print in the book, the first commercially published book to be illustrated with photographs, was an original photograph, tipped in, or glued, to its page.On a spring afternoon in Paris, Talbot photographed the street from his hotel, sufficiently high up to provide a sweeping view of the city's spiky rooftops. The streets have just been wetted down to reduce the dust stirred up from the unpaved road. Although thecalotypeshortened exposure times, the ghost images of carriages that moved on the boulevard during the exposure betray the still-lengthy exposure.
The Nelson Column was still being erected when Talbot photographed it. Placed in Trafalgar Square, London, it honored Sir Horatio Nelson, the victorious naval captain who died in 1805 during battle at sea off Cape Trafalgar, Spain. At 185 feet in height, the Column interfered with the view from the nearby National Gallery and sparked a bitter controversy regarding the physical transformation of the Square. Talbot's image was made from an angle that caused the base of the column to dwarf the buildings in the distance, including the prominent church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Talbot's decision to focus on the base, letting the column itself extend into infinity beyond the image frame, suggests that he thought that the monument was an oversized intrusion.
This photograph was the sixth plate in William Henry Fox Talbot's landmark 1844 publicationThe Pencil of Nature. Aligning his work with the tradition ofgenrepainting, he wrote:  We have sufficient authority in the Dutch school of art, for taking as subjects of representation scenes of daily and familiar occurrence.  Here Talbot turned his camera from the vaulted splendors of his home, LacockAbbey, which he photographed extensively, to the simple door of the stable and the resting tool of the worker.Talbot exhibited and sold variants of this image with the titlesThe Stable DoorandStable Yard in Talbot-type.The diagonally clipped corners of this print suggest that it may have been removed from an album.
Talbot introduced photography to the world in 1839, and his desire to make a permanent image continued for years afterward. One result was the invention of the photogravure process, which reproduced a photographic image using printers' ink. As an innovator and inventor, Talbot created work that is highly important to the Museum's collection and our understanding of the history of photography. This rare experimental picture has a remarkably modern feel to it, in part due to its geometrically abstract quality.
In late 1847 Talbot wrote about his idea for  transferring photography to steel engravings  in order to achieve a reliable method for illustrating books with photographs. He recognized the need for a more permanent image after a disastrous experience resulted in his prints becoming faded and discolored. By 1852 Talbot had experimented with his photomechanical process, which ensured more permanency through printers' ink. The rarity of this print despite being an engraving that theoretically could be widely reproduced, was a compelling factor in acquiring the work for the Museum.
In this drawing, Tanzio da Varallo studied the drapery for the kneeling Virgin Mary in anAnnunciationpainting now presumed lost during World War II. Modeling only the drapery in detail, da Varallo explored how the fabric would lie on the Virgin's body, how much of the body's structure he should reveal, how to attractively yet convincingly arrange the folds, and how light would play on the surfaces and shape the forms. The sense of volume conveyed in his drapery studies reveals his training in sculpture.Da Varallo usually focused his studies on a single feature. Here he only slightly indicated the Virgin's head and hands; in another study he concentrated closely on the heads, hands, and feet, leaving the drapery nearly blank.
Clasping her hands to her chest, the grieving Virgin Mary looks upon the naked body of the dead Christ. His muscular figure reclines on a cloth stretched out upon a rocky ground. Swathed in heavy drapery, the Virgin, looking aged and worn, sways back as she tilts her head forward. Silhouetted against the dark, empty background, she gives visual expression to the emotional poignancy of the scene.Sculptor Cesare Targone rejected the traditional narrative emphasis of images of the grieving Virgin. He eliminated almost all references to the Crucifixion or Christ's other mourners, focusing solely on the Virgin Mary's sorrow, which then becomes a model for the viewer's response to the dead Christ.This devotional object, made of finelychasedembossed gold on black obsidian, may have originally been set into a tabernacle door above an altar.
In a barn, a young maid squats while milking a brown and white spotted cow. Standing nearby, another cow seems to be waiting its turn. Gerard ter Borch treated the routine chore of milking in a straightforward manner, rejecting the humorous themes often favored by seventeenth-century Dutchgenrepainters. He was especially skilled at rendering the textures and surfaces of objects like those found in theforeground: the roughly hewn stool, the wooden basin filled with water, the chipped ceramic crock, and the shiny metal hinges of the buckets. The painting's muted colors and subtle play of light are characteristic of Ter Borch's work.
A dappled gray horse feeds at a manger while a man brushes his coat. A horse blanket and bridle hang from a pole in the foreground and other barnyard utensils--a pitchfork, broom, and pail--fill the stable. To the right, a fashionably dressed woman appears at a doorway that connects to the main farmhouse. Light from the open doorway illuminates the animal, the painting's center of attention.Domestic animals like this carefully groomed horse would have been valued possessions of their prosperous owners during the 1600s in Holland. Clues such as the orderly and well-built stable and the woman's handsome dress and jewelry indicate that this was a well-to-do middle-class household.Gerard ter Borch's paintings are noted for their subtlety of composition, close attention to detail, and delicate color. InHorse Stablehe used apaletteof warm browns and grays, brightened by the red accents of the man's hat, the woman's skirt, and the bricks on the left-hand wall.
 Love will prevail as long as there is music and merrymaking,  wrote Dutch poet Jacob Cats in the 1600s; this painting exemplifies Cats's slogan. As the elegantly dressed woman plays the lute, a man, who may be her instructor, keeps rhythm and time with his hand. The foot warmer in the lower left corner symbolizes love, and the bed suggests an amorous relationship between the man and woman, maybe even seduction.Gerard ter Borch always set a mood, creating a subtle psychological interplay between the people in his intimate paintings. He delighted in meticulously describing and contrasting varied textures: the soft pile of the woman's velvet jacket, distinguished from its plump white fur trim; the shimmer of her pearl-colored satin dress; the dog's soft, wavy fur; and the variations of wood grain in the cello, furniture, and floor. He noticed even the most minute details, such as the nails in the floorboards and the brass door handle. Ter Borch created about eleven paintings of female lute players, often repeating themotifsof the woman in the satin gown and fur-trimmed jacket, the dog, the foot warmer, the four-poster bed in the background, and the partially opened door.
A bacchante, follower ofBacchus, the god of wine, leans forward and grins at the viewer while squeezing a bunch of grapes into a golden drinking vessel. Her posture, exposed breasts, flushed cheeks, and inviting smile allude to her drunken state. There is something disturbing, however, in the way she provocatively confronts the viewer, leaning into the spectator's space and smiling broadly. In the lower left corner an ape mimics the woman's gesture, holding a smaller bunch of grapes in his right paw. The ape may serve a moralizing purpose, condemning excessive drinking.While visiting Rome from about 1604 to 1614, Hendrick ter Brugghen saw the famousBacchusby Caravaggio from which thisclassicalpainting of Bacchus's female follower derives.
The gods received me into the secret chambers of an exquisite photographic happening, which for me is the high point of purity.--Edmund TeskeClutching a book of spells, Mephisto the devil summons his evil powers to control the soul of thealchemistand poet, Faust. He towers ominously above eye level, taking up most of the picture frame. Like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's heroic character in the play,Faust, photographer Edmund Teske himself was a gifted alchemist. His darkroom experiments sometimes led to brilliant discoveries, as it did with this image.The print's partially reversed tones, especially visible in the subject's robe and beard, resulted from Teske's accidentalsolarizationof the negative. This effect heightens the moment's drama, emphasizing the low, frontal stage lighting, which casts eerie shadows on Mephisto's pallid face. As Teske developed the 8-by-10-inch negatives he had exposed during the theater production, he accidentally flashed this one with light.Teske had always admired Man Ray's solarized photographs but could not find out how they were made. After his own fortuitous discovery of solarization, Teske quickly gained control of the technique and continued using it throughout his career as a means to heighten creative expression.
We are both poets. Frank Lloyd Wright was not first of all an architect, he was first of all a poet, expressing himself in terms of architecture, and so a building becomes a poetic statement.--Edmund TeskeIn 1936, Edmund Teske spent several weeks at architect Frank Lloyd Wright's living quarters at Taliesin North in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Teske was there to photograph the architect, Taliesin's buildings and grounds, and Wright's apprentices. The creative atmosphere that Teske encountered there made a profound impression on him that lasted throughout his life.For more than three decades beginning in 1940, Teske spent time working on this montage, which represents Wright's achievements. Teske layered and tore his prints and re-photographed them. Wright's portrait and his famous building Fallingwater form the central focus of the montage, overlapping floor plans of architectural studios and images of Taliesin West and North. The seated woman in the lower right is Wright's third wife, Olgivanna. Wright himself floats above a landscape of dilapidated looking traditional architecture and images of ordinary Americans whom Teske saw as symbolic of society.This collage reflects Teske's internalization of the architect's philosophy. Wright had rejected the ornate style of traditional architecture in favor of sleek, simple lines and natural materials. His organic style emphasized the spiritual and symbiotic ties between nature and architecture. Teske assimilated those concepts and combined them with an interest in Vedantic Hinduism, which teaches that time is fluid and cyclical. Teske's homage to Wright suggests his belief in the interconnection of life experiences.
Anything is art depending on what attitude you bring to it. . . . Art is a matter of picking up the mundane and giving it a higher level of expression.--Edmund TeskeThe subject of this Edmund Teske photograph is both elusive and mundane: a discarded piece of paper lying in a field of grass, rumpled from being blown about. What is most noticeable is the pattern of elongated holes that puncture the strip in intervals. These punched holes are obviously manmade; they appear too regularly spaced and square-shaped to be caused by the branches that the paper is snagged on.This image was part of a series of studies that Teske made of his hometown, Chicago, in which he documented the rundown industrial environment on the city's South Side during the late 1930s. This strip of paper once had a purpose: It generated music from a pianola, or player piano, whose keys performed the notes coded as holes in the paper. Now discarded, it could be imagined that a wind gusting across the prairie might cause a soft whistling sound as it passes through the holes. Although the strip of paper no longer performs the music it was meant to play, by photographing it Teske suggested that even in its rumpled state, it is still worth looking at.
While riding streetcars and subways, passengers often spend their time reading the newspaper, planning the day ahead of them, or reflecting on the day that has just passed. Maintaining his anonymity, as well as that of his subjects, Edmund Teske observed and photographed passengers engaged in these ordinary commuter activities. His choice of subject matter was not unique: at about the same time, Walker Evans was photographing passengers on the New York City subway. Teske and Evans both appreciated the snapshot aesthetic and the informal poses of passengers absorbed in their activities.
At first glance, the subject of this photograph is difficult to identify, but the pattern of holes arranged in concentric circles gives it away. To emphasize the deteriorated state of this kitchen sieve, Edmund Teske combined several experimental darkroom techniques to make this one-of-a-kind print.Teske employed solarization-a process by which some black and white tones are reversed by exposure to light during the development process-and chemical staining, in which the exposed print is alternately developed and exposed to light. The solarization enhances the sieve's unique patterning as well as the blocks of light that draw attention to its form and the blades of grass poking through its eroded bottom. The print's chemical stains and streaks, ranging from reddish-browns to vivid blues, create streaks and colors that evoke the rusting and cracking of the sieve.Teske made this negative in Chicago in 1939 and returned to it many years later to make the print. He did not use traditional toners in his photography. Instead he devised his own duotone solarization technique in the late 1950s, which he applied here. For him, this style of darkroom manipulation resulted in a more organic look in keeping with his philosophy of life. Through his study of Vedantic Hinduism and the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, Teske felt a strong connection to nature. By choosing a decaying object as his subject and by reworking an old negative, Teske underscored his belief in the cyclical nature of time; that life-forms go through periods of disintegration and rebirth.
This artful grouping of music-related objects functions as a sort of shrine. Framed portraits of musicians hang on the wall behind a viola and a bust of classical composer Richard Wagner. A musician's organization membership book, pieces of correspondence, and a set of smoking pipes personalize the arrangement.Edmund Teske came across this table in a music studio owned by the parents of his lover, Richard Soakup. Mrs. Soakup gave music lessons and operated the studio, which was built next to the Soakup's suburban Chicago home. Teske was probably drawn to these objects because music was one of his passions: He took saxophone lessons and learned to play the piano in his youth.This image also reflects Teske's more prosaic documentary approach during a period in which he aimed to make a  portrait  of his hometown. Teske was always drawn to subjects that were more personal to him, especially the environments of people he felt close to. This photograph has an intimate, candid feel to it because of its composition, in which the selection of carefully arranged objects are thrown slightly off-balance by the randomly stacked books and papers to the left. The result demonstrates the interesting duality of Teske's approach: one that is both formal and casual.
All of these intricate parts patterned and designed to fit harmoniously again, to function again for the beauty of motion. Richard was in her and I was under her. Richard was out, I was in and Richard was under. Deep in the guts of her intensity and passion, with the inroads of pain, we loved the same commanding mistress.-Edmund TeskeIn a 1940 letter to his brother, Edmund Teske described this scene, which presents the physical and seductive qualities that he saw in both his car and his teenage lover, Richard Soakup. The image reflects Teske's outlook on human identity, particularly his own fluid approach to sexuality and the idea that a person can embody both masculine and feminine qualities.Soft light draws attention to the youth's curly hair and lithe body, which form a visual contrast to the man's work he is engaged in: repairing a car and getting dirty. For Teske, the male body was as worthy of idealization as the female nude. Soakup is portrayed in a candid way that evokes his sexuality and their intimacy.After moving from Chicago-where this picture was made-to Los Angeles, Teske studied a branch of Eastern philosophy, Vedantic Hinduism, that supported his progressive outlook on human identity. In addition, it taught Teske to believe in fate and chance. Years later, he liked to point out that in this photograph the first four numbers on the car's license plate, 1652, were the same as his Los Angeles street address on Harvard Boulevard.
Teske, based in Los Angeles, often returned to his old negatives for inspiration. Here one negative is printed on top of another to create an imaginative new picture. His male nude composites are candidly erotic and symbolize the process of transformation to which all life is subject. The plant sprouting from the model's loins, wrapping itself delicately around the body, simultaneously conceals and reveals the figure.
In order to achieve results that he called  consistent with a finer feeling of emulsion as plastic pigment,  Edmund Teske manipulated the photographic print in the darkroom, achieving the otherworldly effects seen here. The negative was made at Taliesin West, the Arizona studio of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, for whom Teske worked. The cholla cactus reverberates with energy. This effect was created by Teske's use of the solarization process, which causes each prickly thorn to appear electrified. Teske handled the medium of photography fluidly, experimenting with techniques that allowed him to transform an ordinary negative into an image imbued with mystical possibilities.
Edmund Teske was introduced to Olive Hill, Aline Barnsdall's estate in the center of Hollywood, shortly after he moved to Los Angeles. His attraction to the trees on the estate grew out of his reverence for nature.The reversed tones and varied colors of brown and dark red were achieved by twice exposing the printing paper to light: first while under the negative (made twenty years earlier) in the enlarger and a second time while the print was wet with the developing chemicals. At the second stage of development, the print reacted to the light and changed color from gray to russet, brown, and reddish brown in a process Teske called duotone solarization. His manipulation of the tones produced a sense of mystery and foreboding in the landscape.
At Pandaemonium, the high capitalOf Satan and his peers. Their summons calledFrom every band and squared RegimentBy place or choice the worthiest: they anonWith hundreds and with thousands trooping came.--John Milton,Paradise LostStylishly dressed in a dark suit and striped ascot,avant-gardefilmmaker Kenneth Anger stands atop a bluff in Topanga Canyon. He is surrounded by an imagined metaphysical event evoking Biblical descriptions of the Apocalypse. Horsemen symbolizing divine wrath trample everything beneath them, as angels blow trumpets to unleash natural disasters.To make this composite print, Edmund Teske combined two negatives-the portrait of his friend and a copy of a Gustave Dor engraving illustrating the work of Anger's favorite poet, John Milton. In the epic poem,Paradise Lost, the fallen angel Satan wages war on heaven. This image illustrates a section called  Pandaemonium,  literally meaning  all demons  or hell.Teske made this photograph after years of experimentation with various forms of darkroom manipulation. It exemplifies his later style but also suggests Anger's multilayered,  psychedelic  approach to filmmaking. Anger became known for his experimental, homoerotic films,Fireworks,Eaux d'artifice,andScorpio Rising. An Anger film that Teske collaborated on,Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, covered a similar subject, Dante'sInferno.
This dreamlike image of a female face on the side of a building is the result of two images printed to appear as one. The woman's visage is set against  masculine  elements such as the building's rough exterior, and in the distance, a smokestack and electrical tower. Hanging clothes soften this stark industrial world, and the woman's closed eyes and thoughtful expression set a contemplative mood.Teske photographed the landscape in 1940 in a steel industry shantytown on the outskirts of Chicago. The image is sandwiched with a 1956 negative portraying Shirley Berman, the wife of Wallace Berman, a Beat movement artist and poet. Both were friends of Teske in Los Angeles; he often used Shirley's portrait in composite pictures as an archetypal female figure.For Teske, printing old negatives had a nostalgic and symbolic function. The composite photograph created a timeless, if not idealized, world that would otherwise be out of reach with a more conventional photographic approach. This composite image hints at a psychological state: the realm of the imagination.
Light flooding into a dark interior through an open door emphasizes a man's lean, sensuous body. There is enough light to identify his facial features, but much of his form fuses with the room's shadows. The doorway of blinding light obscures any sense of what is outside. Instead, light and dark function symbolically to create a timeless, spiritual world.The slim figure in this nude study is artist George Herms, who was a prominent Los Angeles Beat movement artist and a good friend of Edmund Teske. He seems aware of being photographed but relaxed and contemplative as he stands in the doorway of his Topanga Canyon studio.Teske and Herms became good friends in the 1960s and shared many ideas about life and art-particularly a fascination for abandoned objects marked by the passage of time. Herms often incorporated discarded items into his sculptural assemblages, while Teske was fond of photographing the same types of subjects. Here, Teske took a similar approach to portraiture as he did to his found-object subjects, aiming to evoke a sense of metaphorical transformation.
This image looks like an album cover or a band poster. Although it was published on the back of The Doors' 1970 compilation album,13, Edmund Teske did not make this photograph for commercial reasons. In the late 1960s he became acquainted with Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors. He was drawn to the musician's blend of feminine and masculine attributes and made several portraits of him.Teske made this photograph of Morrison and The Doors in a garage at the back of his Hollywood studio. The other band members-Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore-are gathered next to Morrison and surround a rather totemic-looking bust of Ludwig van Beethoven on a table.While this is a fairly typical-looking band portrait, Teske made it seem far less conventional by superimposing another image with it. The second picture is a close-up of an old and cracked vinyl seat cushion. Teske's vertical framing emphasizes the cushion's swirling texture, which fills the empty space above the bandmembers' heads. This patterning creates a psychological dimension that complements the subjects' thoughtful expressions.
The Virgin Mary sits on a cushioned throne, watching her mother Saint Anne lovingly clutching the baby Jesus. On the right, Saint Joseph peers eagerly over her shoulder. A cluster ofputtihovers overhead, carrying a large piece of fabric to shelter the Holy Family from behind.Pietro Testa produced two other compositional studies of this scene, probably in preparation for analtarpiece. Since this study lacks detail in the background and is the least finished of the three, it must be the earliest. The final drawing of the group is rounded at the top, implying a curved frame, but no final painting is known today.
Like Albert Renger-Patzsch and August Sander, Else Thalemann believed beauty was inherent both in nature and in human constructions. She chose to document commonplace subjects like locomotives, which were part of the industry in Germany's Ruhr region. Thalemann's croppedcompositionof the powerful wheels of a steam engine challenged 1920s thinking about suitable subject matter, forcefully presenting the notion of beauty in everyday things.
Else Thalemann, who tackled Gustave Eiffel's 1889 tower from many angles, here seems to associate it with the male establishment, which is, as usual, wearing a bowler hat (or as it is called in the United States, a derby). The silhouetted  bowlered  heads pay homage to another symbol of modernism, the Eiffel Tower, and echo a recent analysis of the famous structure: The cheerless leitmotif of an industrial society composed of a colorless, faceless middle-class herd massed beneath infinite numbers of identical black mass-produced hats, geometric and perfect, like so many machine-tooled interchangeable parts.
Use a tail-cut from a female tuna. . . .  Slice it and bake it to a turn, adding a little salt and oil. Eat the slices hot, dipping them in piquant sauce. It is good also if you eat it plain . . . But if you serve it sprinkled with vinegar it is perfection.This was the culinary advice of Archestratus of Gela, a gourmet who lived in one of the Greek colonies in Sicily around the mid-300s B.C. Given Greece's extensive coastline, fish were important in the Greek diet, but depictions of fishing and the sale of fish are rare in Greek art.This Athenianblack-figurekylixor cup depicts a fish market. On one side of the cup, a fishmonger prepares a tuna for sale. He is about to carve up the fish on the chopping block, but steaks already cut from another fish lay on the table behind him and a fish head rests at his feet. On the other side, another man carries a tuna. Large fish like tuna were hard to catch and therefore expensive. Perhaps an image such as this one was intended to display the wealth of the cup's owner and to emphasize the delicacies served in his home.
On this preserved section of recomposed fragments of a large drinking cup-or skyphos--a man balances himself on his right foot as he lifts his left leg and drinks from a large white cup. Individual figures in amusing poses were often used to decorate red-figured drinking cups destined for use in the symposion. But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it. It features white, red, and orange designs painted atop of a black-gloss ground, and often includes delicately incised silhouette. The technique was invented around the same time as thered-figure technique, in approximately 525 B.C.  Both feature a light-on-dark appearance that contrasts with the dark-on-light effect of the olderblack-figure technique.
The Greek heroPerseuspursues the monstrousgorgonsaround the sides of this Athenianblack-figurekyathos. In Greek mythology, Perseus, trapped in a foolish boast, was compelled to obtain the head of the gorgonMedusa, whose gaze turned men to stone. Here Perseus, identified by his winged cap and boots, runs along with his sword drawn. The three gorgon sisters with their winged female bodies and horrifying faces are only slightly distinguished from one another in this unusual portrayal of the myth. Typically, Perseus sneaks up on the sleeping gorgons to behead Medusa, and then the two remaining sisters chase him.A kyathos was a dipper used to ladle wine from large mixing vessels. The shape entered the Athenian pottery repertoire from Etruria, and Athenian artists may have decorated these foreign shapes primarily for export back to Etruria. In fact, this depiction of the Perseus story draws heavily onEtruscanversions. On this kyathos, as on many of the time, the black-figure decoration was not applied on the natural reddish clay of the vessel but on a specially prepared white slip.
Amarchand-mercierprobably commissioned both the design and execution of this vase. He would have purchased the mid-1700s Chineseporcelainbowl and ordered abronzierto make themountsingiltbronze. In this design, four elegant legs extend fromsatyrs'heads, linked with swags of vine leaves and bunches of grapes, to terminate in goat's hooves.This vase was once part of the collection of a Polish princess who had been a great friend of Marie-Antoinette. The Polish princess, who spent a great deal of time in Paris before theFrench Revolution, is reputed to have acquired it at the sale of the contents of the palace ofVersaillesin 1794. Another vase was bought by the Prince Regent, who later became King George IV, for his London residence, Carlton House.
These lidded bowls were intended to hold potpourri, the smell of which passed through the pierced collar. Containers for potpourri first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon produced in large numbers from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer. To create potpourri, fashionable women experimented with dried petals and spices to achieve the finest fragrances, some of which were left to mature for up to nine years. Perfumes and potpourri were used liberally to disguise malodorous air, as indoor plumbing was nonexistent and frequent bathing was considered unhealthy.By means of a drawing in the archives of the Svres porcelain manufactory of a similar, but unmounted bowl, scholars have identified the craftsman who made the twisted and coiledgiltbronzemountson this piece. The drawing, dated 1784, has an inscription noting that it was to be mounted by  Tomier,  Pierre-Philippe Thomire, one of the most celebrated bronze casters of the late 1700s. Thomire is known to have provided bronze mounts for many similar bowls.
On a white marble base, two Vestal Virgins tend a flame that honors the goddess of the hearth, Vesta. A drawing still exists that shows the clock was designed to sit on a mantelpiece, itsclassicaltheme a suitable reference to the fireplace below. The altar that houses the clock's movement is fitted with horizontal enameled and jeweled hour and minute rings, while a sacrificial procession underneath is shown in gilt bronze. A branch of roses draped over the edge of the altar points to the time.Henri-Franois Dubuisson made the clock's dials.
Candelabra such as these would have been placed on a mantelpiece, a commode, or asecrtairein a salon of a Parisian townhouse.A drawing now in the Muse des Arts Dcoratifs in Paris that illustrates a similar candelabra on a mantelpiece helped scholars attribute this piece to the bronze caster Pierre-Philippe Thomire. He frequently used these gilt floral garlands, rams' heads, and bronze griffins as decoration on his pieces.
The reading female represents an allegory of Study, while her male companion who writes on a tablet is Philosophy. These purely decorative objects copy the form of ancient oil lamps, but they were not actually functional.In 1780 the sculptor Louis-Simon Boizot sold models for these figures to the Svres porcelain manufactory, which produced them in unglazed white porcelain until 1786. The bronze chaser Pierre-Philippe Thomire mounted many pieces of the porcelain sold by the factory and therefore could have obtained Boizot's models for these bronze pieces through this close connection.
The shape of these two large wall lights suggests a vase hung on a real ribbon. Each is decorated with three female masks adorned with feathered crowns and garlands of fruit and flowers, and clusters of oak leaves and acorns are suspended below. The arms of the wall lights sprout vines and grapes.In 1787 the bronze caster Pierre-Philippe Thomire delivered three pairs of wall lights identical to the ones in the Getty Museum to the chteau of Saint-Cloud for the king's gaming room. Today those wall lights hang in the Petit Trianon atVersailles.
An ancient Roman religious rite inspired this clock, designed in the Neoclassical style after a drawing by Hubert Robert that was published as an engraving between 1771 and 1773. Two bronze priestesses of the temple of Vesta, the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth and its fire, carry the altar bearing the sacred flame. The sacred flame and the vigilance of the maidens, who kept the altar fire burning continuously, came to symbolize eternity, a suitable association for a timepiece. The theme extends to the hour and minute hands, which are in the form of a snake, another symbol of eternity.The French craftsmen added fine chasing to emphasize decorative details on the pedestal altar, the delicate ritual vessels, and the arabesque patterns on the altar cloth surrounding the clock face. Panels representing Art and Science flank a frieze with cherubs and a goat. Four lounging lions and a marble plinth support the clock. Pierre-Philippe Thomire designed a number of examples of this piece, two of which belonged to Queen Marie-Antoinette.
Saint Thomas, one of Jesus' disciples, was not present when the resurrectedChristfirst appeared to his disciples. Until he had seen for himself the wounds of Jesus'Crucifixion, Thomas refused to believe in theResurrection. WhenJesusappeared again, he instructed Thomas to touch the nail holes in his hands and feel the gash in his side. Finally,  Doubting Thomas  believed.In thiscomposition, a heroic Christ strides forward confidently, cape billowing and surrounded by a radiant glow. Pellegrino Tibaldi characteristically used a nervously energetic line and treated the disciples' hair as if composed of small ringlets. HisManneristtendencies led him to fill the sheet almost to overflowing with his swelling figures. Taking inspiration from Michelangelo's massive forms, Tibaldi gave the figures muscularity, vitality, and heavy limbs. His profuse whiteheighteninggives this drawing the feel of a painting.On the verso, Tibaldi made a study for the figure of Thomas.
To escape Herod's soldiers, theVirgin MaryandJosephfled into Egypt with the infantJesus. Most representations of this story show Mary carrying Jesus in her arms while riding on a donkey, and Joseph leading the animal by the halter. In this drawing, however, an angel helps the Virgin and Child aboard a boat. Joseph is barely visible between the angel and the Virgin.Giovanni Battista Tiepolo interpreted the scene with the nautical expertise of a painter born and raised in Venice. He chose a flat-bottomed vessel not unlike the gondolas that still ply the waters of his native city. The energetically applied washes and the action of the boatman about to push off from the bank convey a sense of urgency. Tiepolo left areas of the paper untouched, creating light and dark contrasts that suggest brilliant sunlight and shadow.
Two punchinellos--masked hunchbacks dressed in white suits and tall hats--accost a drunken woman. One punchinello leans into and leers at the woman; the other lifts her long skirt from behind. Two other punchinellos lurk behind the woman, only their hats visible. Like the punchinellos, the woman sports an elaborate hat and a beaklike nose. She has perhaps been mistaken for a kindred, and compliant, spirit.The character of Punchinello, and his similarly dressed companions, first appeared in Italian theater in the 1600s. His buffoonery and ribald behavior made him an immensely popular figure in Venetian street performances. His Italian name,Pulcinella, suggests that Punchinello's family tree included chickens, an ancestry confirmed by his beaklike nose.Here, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo has depicted the punchinellos on an especially lascivious and even sinister outing. Tiepolo produced more than twenty punchinello drawings, and they were most likely made as independent works for collectors rather than studies for paintings or prints.
A boyish artist gazes longingly at the regal woman whose portrait he is painting. The young artist is Alexander the Great'scourt painter, Apelles, whom ancient writers considered the greatest artist of their time. According toPliny'sNatural Historyof 77 A.D., Alexander commissioned Apelles to paint a portrait of his favorite concubine, Campaspe. The story illustrates art's transformative powers: Apelles fell in love with his sitter as he captured her beauty on canvas. Alexander so esteemed his painter that he presented Campaspe to Apelles as a reward for the portrait.The tale of Alexander and Apelles, a favorite ofRenaissanceandBaroquepainters, celebrates the power and nobility of painting. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo painted this episode at least three times. For this, the third rendering, he adopted aclassicizingstyle in which antique architectural elements andreliefsculptures evoke a sumptuous palace setting. Thebackgroundprovides a focal area for the gaze ofAlexander the Great, who appears handsome and self-confident, yet unaware of the charged glances shared by Apelles and Campaspe.
Giambattista Tiepolo made this final preparatory study for a large illusionisticfrescothat covered the ceiling of the Scalzi church in Venice. The fresco was destroyed by bombing in World War I. According to a fifteenth-century legend, when the Virgin Mary's house inNazarethcame under threat by invadingSaracenarmies, it was miraculously transported in 1291 from the Holy Land to Loreto, a small town on Italy's Adriatic coast.Using an oval shape, Tiepolo painted the scene in three parts, depicting the figures in the lowest register in large scale and those near the top much smaller in size. This technique, calleddi sotto in s(from below upward) gives the viewer the illusion that the scene is an extension of his space: the ceiling of the church opens up to reveal the events of the miracle. In the upper register, painted in golden hues, God the Father and the dove of theHoly Spiritpreside amidst a chorus of music-making angels. The central area of the canvas features the Virgin and Child and the Holy House borne aloft by angels. Saint Joseph, with his arms raised overhead, accompanies them. On the right, three trumpeting angels announce the event. In the lowest register, closest to the viewer's space, amassof dark figures personifying evil recoil and fall away from the Holy House. Other figures, some wearing turbans and carrying weapons symbolizing the invading Saracens, watch from the periphery.
This man is looking at someone--or something--well beyond the boundaries of the page, but his stare and half-open mouth hint at a state of ecstasy or revelation. Artists of the eighteenth century often portrayed saints, martyrs, or those who witnessed miracles with such expressions. Whether this portrait represents a particular religious figure, though, is not known. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo may have made this drawing as a study for a larger painting. In preparation for each section of an oil painting or fresco, Tiepolo made chalk studies of figures' heads, limbs, and hands.With animated strokes, Tiepolo applied red and white chalk to blue paper, a technique favored by Venetian artists for its striking contrast. Dark red strokes define the model's facial features, including a gap between his front teeth; velvety red chalk softens the outlines and contours of his face. White highlights indicate a strong light from above, further hinting at a divine presence.
Giovanni Battista Tiepolo captured this man's flamboyant character with few lines. Thin strokes exaggerate his birdlike features, which include a nose that resembles a beak, spindly legs, and duck-toed feet. Fluid washes and pen lines are applied sparingly to his costume and puffy wig. The man seems oblivious to his ridiculous looks, an exaggeration that is typical of caricature--a comical style of portraiture.Leonardo da Vinci first sketched caricatures in the 1500s, and Italian artists centuries afterward furthered the genre. Working two hundred years after Da Vinci, Tiepolo drew caricatures like this funny-looking man in addition to the serious subjects for which he is known. He made these drawings as independent works of art, sometimes for his own amusement. His drawings cast anonymous people as stereotypes, such as lawyers, dandies, doctors, and hunchbacks.
Giovanni Battista Tiepolo probably created his few landscape drawings for their own sake, purely for enjoyment during summer visits to the countryside. Long admired as an exceptional draftsman, Tiepolo used rapid strokes of ink and dark, fluid washes to evoke the flat terrain and bright sunlight of the Veneto, the region of Italy around Venice.Instead of architectural accuracy or detail, Tiepolo explored light, tone, and texture. Clouds cast shadows on the sunlit building, and even the golden brown shadows on the stone outer wall are suffused with light, but the exact building cannot be identified. To render the quickly sketched large tree, which acts as a foil for the greatmassof this typically Venetian villa, Tiepolo adopted Guercino's dynamicchiaroscuroeffects.
In this barren landscape acentaurand a femalefaunlie enraptured in each other's arms. Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo borrowed from mythology to invent this erotic image, which is part of a series of drawings he made of centaurs, fauns, andsatyrs.To the Greeks and Romans, these imaginary creatures represented lust. Tiepolo also modeled them after a legend aboutHercules, who killed a centaur for attempting to seduce his wife. A quiver of arrows, a bow, and a club-weapons identified with Hercules-lie near the centaur. The centaur's head is thrown back, and he reclines as if dead, but the faun's joyful expression conveys otherwise. Although the original tale is about seduction and attempted rape, Tiepolo suggests here that the lovemaking is consensual.Tiepolo's loose drawing style seems appropriate for this fantasy world. Fluid ink washes define the landscape and almost envelop the creatures, while sketchy pen lines exaggerate the rocky terrain and the characters' subtle gestures.
In the center of this chaotic, theatrical scene, Mary Magdalen kneels to anoint Christ's feet, while Judas Iscariot stands before them scorning the waste of precious ointment. Rather than showing the scene as it would have appeared during the Biblical era, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo created an image related to contemporary Venice, with wigged and turbaned gentlemen crowding a large room. The tonal nuances of golden washes throughout the sheet are characteristic of Tiepolo's style. Divine light pours in from the direction to which Christ points, and the large column along the center of the sheet stands in shadow against the masonry wall. Tiepolo created this large drawing as part of an extensive Biblical series of more than 250 sheets depicting scenes from the lives of Christ and the Apostles. He conceived each drawing in the series as an independent work of art.
In his distinctive black mask, Punchinello totters shakily toward a chair with the help of an attendant and a long cane. A comic character in Italian theater, his humpback, hooked nose, and stupidity made him the focus of much humor in thecommedia dell'arteand other popular entertainments. Other characters, also wearing masks, stand around watching the scene, preparing a chair for the weary Punchinello and fetching an umbrella.Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo produced this drawing as part of a series of 103 works dealing with specific episodes in the life of Punchinello, entitledDivertimento per li ragazzi(Diversions for Children). The scenes, whose themes range from amusement to tragedy, illuminate the complex character of the hunchbacked fool. As a testament to Tiepolo's fondness for this subject, he decorated his family home, Villa Ziani, with images from the series.Tiepolo sketched the drawing first in black chalk, which was easy to change, before drawing in the figures with pen, ink, and brown wash. The numerous black chalk lines that still remain suggest that the artist made several changes to the design before he settled on this scene.
Jean-Baptiste Tilliard made this unusually large bed for a bedroom in a grand private residence. The bed would have been placed sideways against a wall, with a draped baldachin, now missing, above. The large wheels allowed servants to pull out the body of the bed easily, leaving the tall back attached to the wall while they made it up. It was probably set into an alcove or niche in the bedroom wall.In eighteenth-century France, a bed of this shape was called alit  la turque(Turkish bed) because of its two scrolling ends. This title does not refer to any specific Turkish design source but reflects the eighteenth-century preoccupation with anything exotic and unusual from foreign countries. Turkey, China, and Egypt were among the places that inspired craftsmen in their creation ofromanticand luxurious interiors. The intention was not to accurately recreate foreign objects but to impart a feeling of exotic opulence, even if only through the name attached to an object. The fashion for things  Turkish  peaked in the middle of the 1700s, whenMadame de Pompadourhad a bedroom that was known as thechambre  laturque(Turkish bedroom) only because the paintings displayed in the room showed a slave girl presenting a cup of tea to a sultaness.
Chairs came in a variety of shapes and sizes in eighteenth-century France, with carving frequently matching that on other pieces of furniture such as console tables, settees, mirrors, or the wood paneling. By the 1700s two types of chairs had developed for formal and more relaxed seating arrangements.Chaises meublants(furnishing chairs) were designed without carving on their backs and were arranged symmetrically against the wall around the sides of a room.Chaises courants(literally, running chairs) could be moved around a room and were designed to be seen from all sides.This set of four chairs and a settee was designed to be arranged against a wall. The wooden frames are fairly massive, yet the carving of the decorative elements is extremely fine. The decoration incorporates such Neoclassical motifs as crisp acanthus leaves, egg-and-dart molding, and straight, fluted legs.
Intended as a grave gift, this Athenian white-ground lekythos depicts family members preparing to visit a loved one's grave. The woman holds a basket filled with standard funerary offerings: ribbons, wreaths, andaryballoi, a type of small oil vessel. The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.
Jacopo Tintoretto covered both therectoandversoof this sheet with four animated copies of the same bronze statuette of Atlas. Each sketch shows Atlas from the same tilted angle, in acontrappostostance with his right foot slightly raised and his head twisted to look under his bent left arm. Each figure sits at a sharp diagonal angle, as though it had been twisted and compressed within the confines of the page and was trying to break free. Atlas's contorted position increases the overall sense of energy and muscular strength. Although each figure's position remains nearly the same, Tintoretto subtly varied the surface shading throughout. Delicate lines of parallel hatching emphasize the rippling, bumpy muscles that cover Atlas's arms, legs, and chest.Tintoretto and his workshop made at least fifteen drawings based on the statuette. The stock figure appears in a number of his paintings.
Resting her head on her hand, a voluptuous woman stretches across the sheet and displays the rounded curves of her nude body. In this quick sketch, Domenico Tintoretto conveyed the model's languorous repose as she relaxes, head thrown back and legs outstretched. The artist focused on the central part of her body in the upper right corner. His confident strokes of black chalk define the sensuous curves of her body, while quickly-drawn white chalk lines add texture and substance to her form. In this sketch, Tintoretto also explored different ways to position his model on paper. This is most visible in her face, where the outlines of two poses overlap.Tintoretto probably made this sketch for future use in a mythologicalcomposition, as both the woman's pose and form resemble the figure of the goddessVenusin contemporary Venetian artworks. But the artist's will, which mentions  150 studies from nature after men and 50 after women,  reveals his general fascination with the human figure.
Costumed in the latest style and surrounded by fashionable decorative objects, the Marquise de Miramon wears a rose colored, ruffled peignoir, or dressing gown. Around her neck are a black lace scarf and a silver cross. Reflecting the new European fascination with Japanese art, behind her is a Japanese screen depicting cranes on a gold ground, and on the mantelpiece are several pieces of Japanese ceramics. The needlework on the Louis XVI stool indicates that the subject is a noble woman of leisure, and the eighteenth-century terracotta bust suggests her husband's aristocratic heritage.Thrse -Stephanie-Sophie Feuillant (1836-1912) was from a wealthy bourgeois family. She inherited a fortune from her father and in 1860 she married Rne de Cassagnes de Beaufort, Marquis de Miramon. She stands in the Chteau de Paulhac, Auvergne, her husband's family seat.Tissot painted many fashionable women during his career, but he held this work in particularly high regard. In 1866, he wrote to request, and received, permission to borrow the painting and submit it to the Paris World Fair, where it was seen in public for the first time. The family kept this letter from Tissot along with a swatch of the Marquise's pink velvet gown. Today, the fabric swatch and the painting are in the collection of the Getty Museum and the letter is part of the collection of the Getty Research Institute.
Jacques Joseph Tissot made this drawing as an elaborate study for a well-known painting,The Last Evening,now in the collection of the Guildhall Art Gallery in London.The young woman is contemplating the departure of her love, a sailor who is preparing to go out to sea. Tissot, who often drew and painted people in introspective states of mind, captured her sitting pensively in a rocking chair. She seems lost in thought, staring forward. The fingertips of her right hand barely rest against her pale cheek while her legs extend to reach the chair's footrest. He portrays the woman's clothes realistically, carefully depicting her black-and-white plaid tunic, and juxtaposing it with the brown-red tartan of her skirt. A hat wrapped in gauzy fabric surrounds her shock of strawberry-blonde hair. Tissot usedheighteningto create vivid and shinyhighlightsalong the chair's frame, while gentle shadows fall beneath the chair, adding depth. His use of gouache simulates the look of oil painting.Tissot's friend, Margaret Freebody, served as the model for the study and painting. Freebody's husband and brother appear in the painting as well, which depicts the figures gathered on the deck of a ship.
He was a handsome gentleman, well built and tall . . . who was always exquisitely dressed and well perfumed--in peacetime and in wartime--right down to the saddles of his horses.-- The Abbot of BrantmeTitian's Portrait of Alfonso d'Avalos, painted in Bologna in the winter of 1533, signals the inception of one of the most influential prototypes in the history of Western art-the standing state portrait. Dressed in armor with a diminutive page looking up to him, Alfonso d'Avalos exudes the tremendous power he wielded as governor of Milan and commander general of imperial forces in Italy under the Holy Roman Emperor,Charles V. As the Abbot of Brantme--a French historian--observed, Avalos was a man who took great care with his appearance. He was born into an illustrious Spanish-Neapolitan family and trained for a military career under his cousin, Ferdinando Francesco, the Marchese di Pescara. After winning numerous military campaigns, Avalos was honored with theOrder of the Golden Fleece. He is shown wearing the Order's royal collar over an elaborate and beautifully wrought suit of armor befitting an imperial leader. In the lower left, his page hands him a helmet. Titian, who may have known Avalos personally, endowed him with all the earnestness of a learned and contemplative man, while at the same time conveying his authority.Titian, along with Raphael, set the standard for court portraiture during the subsequent development of Western painting. This portrait heralds such remarkable later paintings as Anthony van Dyck'sPortrait of Agostino Pallavicini,Domenico Fetti'sPortrait of a Man with a Sheet of Music,and Guercino'sPopeGregory XV.
In this masterful drawing of a nude man hoisting a rudder on his shoulder, Titian used the blue paper that artists in Venice so often favored. The blue served as a middle tone, with the shadows and outlines drawn in black chalk and the rippling back muscles highlighted in white. Just as in his characteristically textural paintings, Titian combined the three colors to fully model a three-dimensional figure. The smudgy, roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of the varied play of light over a sculptural form. The figure's unusual, slightly twisted pose is the focus, rather than such details as the man's facial features.
This painting of a repentant Mary Magdalene lifting her teary eyes to heaven was meant to inspire a greater spiritual devotion, at a time when Catholicism was being challenged by theProtestantreformation. Owing to the popularity of the subject, Titian and his workshop made at least seven versions of this painting.X-raysof the painting revealed that Titian made numerous changes to thecomposition, suggesting that he used this canvas to work out his ideas over a considerable period of time. This Getty painting is unique because it is the only composition that shows the Magdalene'sBibleresting on a cloth-covered support rather than a skull--a symbol used to invite contemplation of death.Images of Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman whomJesusfound worthy to redeem and who would spend the rest of her life in solitude to atone for her sins, were especially prevalent during the Counter-Reformation, a period of devout Catholicism that lasted from approximately 1540 to 1640. Upon seeing Titian's conception of Mary Magdalene, the art historian Vasari declared that the picture  profoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire. 
The goddess Venus tries to restrain her lover Adonis from going off to the hunt. She clings to him, imploring him not to go, but Adonis looks down at her impassively. His dogs strain at their leashes, echoing his impatience, as detailed in the tragic love story found in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Cupid sleeps in the background, a symbol of Adonis's resistance to Venus's entreaties, since his ineffective arrows hang uselessly in a tree. The story ends tragically; during the hunt the mortal Adonis is fatally gored by a wild boar.Titian's loose, energetic strokes of paint give the painting a sense of spontaneity and movement. In some areas, the artist even painted with his finger, as seen in Adonis's arm. The composition's dynamism springs from the torsion caused by Venus's awkward pose, which was inspired by an ancient sculptural relief. Titian used rich colors, shimmering highlights, and a lush landscape to create the painting's evocative, poignant mood.
Known in his paintings for exploring the effects of light on surfaces, Titian here showed that he could achieve similar results with line. His meticulous execution and concern for detail suggest the light, space, and variety of physical forms in the landscape. He suggested textures through varying styles of line, from the loose sketchiness of the puffy trees at the left to the more detailed, yet fluidly rendered, drapery on the female figure at the right. Carefully and economically placed hatchings capture the goat's shimmering fur. Titian even created air with line, as in the atmosphere that envelops the distant city.The subject is enigmatic, though it may relate to the erotic mythologies that Titian was painting for King Philip II of Spain at about the same time. The underlying theme may be Idleness or Indolence, represented by the two shepherds lounging in the shade with their flock of sheep. Indolence may lead to Lust, personified by the female nude whose face is covered and accompanied by her attributes, the goat and the boar.
A cock crouches with his head forward and his hackles raised on the lip of this Athenianblack-figureLittle Master cup. His pose reveals that he is a gamecock. Cock fighting was a favorite sport of Athenian youth. The cockfight came to be seen as a metaphor for human combat, with many fighting birds named after Greek mythological heroes. Cock imagery also has an erotic element in Athenian art, since cocks were a favorite gift from men to their boy lovers. Little Master cups, so named for their detailed miniature decoration, were introduced around 560 B.C. With a taller, slimmer profile than earlier cups, Little Master cups are divided into lip cups and band cups, easily differentiated by the placement of their decoration.Standard lip cups are decorated with a compact scene of one to three figures centered on each side of the lip, with an inscription below, in the zone between the handles. The inscription might be a motto, an artist's signature, or even just a nonsensical combination of letters, attesting to the decorative aspects of writing in this period when few people were literate.
Probably painted from life, a semi-clad woman rests with her face hidden and her breast and shoulders exposed. This viewpoint--with the woman observed from above and behind--emphasizes her submissiveness and the spectator's control. The row of small tables and chairs implies a less-than-private setting, perhaps a cafe or brothel. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec explored the worlds of the theater, the cabaret, and the brothel--what the poet Charles Baudelaire called  the pleasures of Parisian life.  Edgar Degas's series of pastel bathers, which were exhibited at the eighth Impressionist exhibition in spring 1886, may have inspired this particular subject and unusual angle of view.To quickly capture the scene, Toulouse-Lautrec used tempera or casein, both quick-drying, opaque media that emphasize individual strokes rather than smooth modeling. The layered, linear strokes of pastel colors impose a common texture on the picture's various elements: skin, hair, cloth, wood, and wicker.
In a letter dated March 1899, an English poet wrote:  Toulouse-Lautrec you will be sorry to hear was taken to a lunatic asylum yesterday.  The scandal was in fact highly publicized. By the time Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was thirty-five, he was suffering from alcoholism and dementia, most likely brought on by syphilis. His behavior was unpredictable, and often violent. Desperate, his mother had him committed to a clinic, then known as an asylum, outside of Paris.While in the clinic, Toulouse-Lautrec set upon the idea of creating a series of circus drawings to demonstrate his emotional stability and thus secure his release. Drawn from memories culled over many years of attendance at this popular entertainment, these works reveal his acute observation of horses, dogs, acrobats, clowns, and bareback riders. In this image, a performer still wearing her slippers follows a lumpy horse into the arena to perform for the spectators in the stands. Toulouse-Lautrec elongated the shadows behind the slippers to emphasize the woman's fatigue. Upon being released from the clinic after only three months, Toulouse-Lautrec declared:  I bought my freedom with my drawings. 
Marie-Antoinette sat in this chair while her servants arranged her hair and applied her makeup in her bedroom at the Petit Trianon a small house built on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. Known as achaise de toilette, its swivel mechanism and low back were specially designed for performing the daily rituals of dressing. It is finely carved with bands of lily of the valley and ivy along the curved supports of the arms, while the legs and edge of the circular seat imitate caning.The Petit Trianon was given to the queen by her husband, Louis XVI, as a private retreat where she could escape from the rigid etiquette of court life. Marie-Antoinette furnished these intimate apartments, which were never seen by most of the courtiers, with exquisite furniture that reflected her own personal taste.This chair was part of a set of furniture delivered to the palace in 1787 that also included two armchairs, two side chairs, a fire screen, and a stool. The bed from the set is missing, but the rest remains at the Petit Trianon. The other pieces retain the original pastel-colored paint in yellow, blue, green, and white that has unfortunately been stripped from this chair.
In the Metamorphoses, the Roman poet Ovid described how nymphs bathed Diana, the goddess of the hunt, in a stream of clear water. Jean-Franois de Troy portrayed the moment after the bath when the nymphs are drying Diana's body and refastening her tunic. To the left, a nymph attempts to shield Diana's nudity from a lecherous river god's sight. De Troy's choice of subject matter and the description of the women's flesh--creamy white with a pink blush tint--give this painting an erotic charge. The river god, watching the scene voyeuristically from the side, becomes a stand-in for the viewer.De Troy used a warm palette of autumnal and pastel colors to describe the surrounding foliage and sky. Layers of glazes intensify the glowing tones.
As told by the Roman poetOvidin theMetamorphoses, the lustysatyrPaneagerly pursued the woodnymphSyrinx. Guarding her virtue, she ran until she reached a river and desperately begged her sisters of the stream to transform her. Just as Pan was about to embrace her, Syrinx changed into cattail reeds. When Pan discovered that he was holding nothing but marsh reeds, he sighed in disappointment, causing the wind to blow through the reeds. He was enchanted by the sound, believing it to be the mournful cry of his beloved Syrinx; from the reeds he fashioned a set of pipes so that he could have her with him always.In thispendanttoDiana and her Nymphs Bathing,Jean-Franois de Troy represented the climax of thenarrative. Syrinx, who is seen both before and after the transformation, looks fearfully at Pan as she falls into the arms of Ladon, the river god. Half in shadow, the river nymphs watch apprehensively and huddle together protectively. As he grasps the clump of cattails, Pan seems near ecstasy. The women's soft, creamy skin contrasts with Pan's dark, muscular torso and the autumnal foliage in thebackground.
A maid puts the finishing touches on her mistress's hair while two women lean in to listen breathlessly to what she is saying. Partially disguised and holding masks, they wear lavish cloaks in anticipation of the evening festivities ahead. Candles flicker, illuminating the eager faces of the group and contributing to the mood of hushed expectancy.Jean-Francois de Troy developed thetableaux de mode,depictions of scenes from upper-class life with an emphasis on sumptuous costumes, opulent interiors, and hints of amorous intrigue. At the time, some critics disapproved of the aristocratic life of leisure celebrated by paintings like this one.Before the Ballwas exhibited at the ParisSalonof 1737 with its companion piece,After the Ball.When exhibited, the pair was declared De Troy's finest work.
A popular devotional tool, books of hours contain a cycle of prayers and meditations focusing on the Virgin Mary for laypersons to recite at various times of day. Artists personalized the books to suit the requirements and interests of individual patrons. This book, for example, contains two miniatures that allude to specific paintings owned by King Ren I of Anjou.Eight full-page and six half-page miniatures, as well as numerous historiated initials, decorate this book of hours. The manuscript represents some of the earliest known work of Georges Trubert, who served King Ren at his court in Provence in the 1480s. Another artist in the book worked in a style common to artists active to the north, in the Loire valley. In general, all three of the book's illuminators explored diverse ways to make painted objects appear palpable and three-dimensional against the flat page, sometimes by creating atrompe-l'oeileffect.
Isolated on the Greek island of Patmos, a youthful Saint John inscribes the opening words of his account of the life ofChriston a scroll draped across his lap. An inkpot and the carrying case for his quill pen are at his feet, and his symbol, the eagle, is perched in front of him. Theilluminator, Georges Trubert, depicted the nearby islands and ships with careful precision. Especially remarkable are the two distant islands, which appear in very faint blue on the horizon.
In the story told in Saint Luke'sGospel, the youthfulVirgin Mary, pregnant with theChristChild, rejoices with her elderly cousinElizabeth, who is miraculously pregnant withSaint John the Baptistdespite her infertility and advanced age. Elizabeth's weathered face and stooped back form a vivid contrast to Mary's youthful appearance and graceful stance. The anonymous artist stressed Mary's pregnant condition by placing her distended abdomen in the center of thecomposition, framed by the women's hands.The receding landscape andillusionisticborder demonstrate the artist's ability to defy the two-dimensional quality of the flat page.Atmospheric perspectivepushes the rolling horizon into the distance, while brown monochrome gives the border the character of wood carved in shallowrelief.
In thisminiature, the three wise men who followed the star of Bethlehem from the east pay homage toChrist. In the Middle Ages, artists and authors traditionally represented the wise men as kings with individual names and characteristics. Caspar, the oldest, kneels before the Virgin and Child and offers a gift of gold, while Melchoir, the youngest, points out the star to Balthazar, represented as a black man following late medieval custom.Each of the gifts offered to Christ had symbolic value in the Middle Ages: gold in homage to Christ's kingship; frankincense, an oil used in worship in ancient times, in honor of his divinity; and myrrh, used in embalming, foreshadowing his death. In the later Middle Ages, theMagioften personified the three parts of the known world (Africa, Asia, and Europe); their facial features and dress in this miniature suggest this interpretation.
Georges Trubert supplemented the basic story of the Holy Family's flight from Herod's soldiers with representations of miraculous, apocryphal accounts popularized during the Middle Ages. A golden column in thebackgroundpartially supports a paganidolthat toppled as the family passed, an indication that the Messiah's coming doomed pagan religions.In the story of the miracle of the wheat field, shown to the left, theHoly Familypassed a newly sown field of wheat while fleeing, and it miraculously grew to full height. Later, soldiers pursuing the family asked a farmer when the travelers had passed; though now harvesting the same wheat, he truthfully replied that he saw them when the wheat was planted. Discouraged, the soldiers turned back. Thenarrativeunfolds from back to front, suggesting the family's progress on its journey. This movement continues in theforegroundas the mule, depicted mid-step, carries the Virgin and Child, whileJoseph, partially hidden by the miniature's frame, begins to disappear from sight.
In this book of hours, an image of the Madonna and Child prefaces a prayer commonly found in books of hours. Addressed to the Virgin, it begins withObsecro te domina(I beseech you lady). The image's painted gold frame serves as a support for the beginning of the text. Georges Trubert depicted the jewel-encrusted frame as a three-dimensional object casting a shadow on the page, while the chain from which it hangs runs through two slits seemingly cut into the surface of the page, an outstanding example of trompe-l'oeil.The bush that burned but was not consumed, which Moses encountered while on Mount Sinai, appears below the image of the Virgin crowned as Queen of Heaven. Medieval theologians likened the bush to Mary's virginity, which remained intact after the conception of Christ. The flames spreading from the flowering bush form a decorative, rhythmic border for the entire page.
A bust-length Madonna, with head and eyes cast down and wearing a veil, forms a mournfuldevotional image. She is doubly framed, first by the rays of golden light emanating from her person and accompanied by a ring of stars and then by an elaborate gold and silver reliquary-like frame with Arabic inscriptions. At the top right, the royalemblemof the Nasrid dynasty of Grenada translates as  There is no victorious one except God.  The other inscriptions are simply nonsensical arrangements of Arabic characters. Below the Madonna, the artist painted the first words of the prayerO Intemerata,creating the illusion that the words appear on a piece of parchment tacked to the wood of the frame.For thisminiature, Georges Trubert,court painterto King Ren I of Anjou, copied a celebratedByzantineiconof a weeping Madonna that belonged to King Ren. Trubert probably copied the now-lost icon of the Madonna accurately but concocted the elaborate frame from his imagination.
The isolated figure of John the Baptist is set against a harsh, minimal landscape. He points up toward heaven with a brittle finger and looks down reflectively toward the inhospitable earth. The Latin words on his winding scroll, taken from the Bible, explain the barren setting,Ego vox clamantis [in deserto](I am the voice crying aloud in the wilderness).The cutting comes from a Franciscan gradual (the choir book containing the sung portions of the mass) illuminated by the important fifteenth-century Italian artist, Cosm Tura, official court artist to the prominent Este family of Ferrara. Tura imbues the scene with a sense of palpable melancholy, not only through the sensitively rendered face of Saint John, but also through the stark landscape and muted colors of the miniature.
On a dramatic, rocky area of the northern coast of Wales looms the late medieval Conway Castle. It towers over a stormy bay while fisherman struggle to pull their boats ashore. Caught in this uproaring of the sea, the tiny figures of fishermen in their boat convey a sense of humans' barely significant place in the order of the universe.The Welsh landscape exerted a strong hold on Joseph Mallord William Turner, and he made several sketching trips there in the 1790s. In this early Romantic painting, Turner represented the dramatic effects of natural light, allowing sunshine breaking through the clouds to illuminate the castle and the coast beyond.
The Romantic painter and draftsman Joseph Mallord William Turner often revealed nature reigning supreme and obliterating human presence. Waves dash to pieces a barely visible ship in a storm several miles beyond Land's End, the westernmost point of England, guarded by a lighthouse called Long Ship's. Aesthetician John Ruskin wrote of this drawing that Turner captured  the whole surface of the sea . . . undirected, bounding, and crashing, and coiling in an anarchy of enormous power. To convey the experience of nature's turbulence, Turner used the full range of watercolor technique, from transparentwashesin the sky to thickbodycolorin the water and rocks. He added highlights to enrich the texture and atmosphere, blotting the wash to reveal the white of the paper in the lighthouse and scratching directly into the paper to render the flecks of light in the waves crashing over the boat. With these bold techniques, Turner came close to modern abstraction in his efforts to expand the expressive and stylistic range of landscape painting.He made this watercolor for a series of engravings entitledPicturesque Views in England and Wales, published between 1827 and 1838.
Ten years after his final journey to Rome, Turner envisioned the Eternal City through a veil of memory. Baroque churches and ancient monuments in and around the Roman Forum seem to dissolve in iridescent light shed by a moon rising at left and a sun setting behind the Capitoline Hill at right. Amidst these splendors, the city's inhabitants carry on with their daily activities. The picture's nacreous palette and shimmering light effects exemplify Turner at his most accomplished.When first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 with its pendant,Ancient Rome; Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus,the painting was accompanied by a modified quotation from Lord Byron's masterpiece,Childe Harold's Pilgrimage(1818):  The moon is up, and yet it is not night,   The sun as yet divides the day with her.  Like the poem, Turner's painting evokes the enduring sublimity of Rome, which had been for artists throughout history less a place in the real world than one in the imagination.The painting is in a remarkable state of preservation and remains untouched since it left Turner's hands.
In this narrativehistory painting, Joseph Mallord William Turner expressed the power of nature and the heroism of man through the eyes of aRomanticpainter. Turner used quick, slanting brushstrokes to describe the stormy sky. The application of scumbled white paint suggests churning, turbulent seas and the heavy spray of waves hitting the ship's bow. Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the sea's violent power.On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673. In perhaps a symbolic overture signaling his submission to authority, Tromp is shown, in Turner's words,  going about to please his Masters. 
This delicately modeledMadonna and Childdisplays a type of hushed beauty lost with the advent of the HighRenaissancestyle in Italy. Once artists began using one-pointperspectiveto present landscapes, architecture, and figures in three well-rounded dimensions, painting became a window on the physical world rather than merely the spiritual one.In an effort to  open up  the scene, the artist from Paolo Uccello's workshop placed a landscape behind the Virgin andChrist. Instead of trying to show depth, however, the countryside simply forms a pattern of almost abstract trees and zigzags. The resulting design has a flatness and regularity that subtly enlivens the picture and complements the elusive three-dimensionality of the figure group.An earlier owner of this painting partly rubbed off the Madonna's bronzehaloduring a cleaning, perhaps assuming that there would be gold underneath.
Lucas van Uden often set out into the countryside early in the morning to make landscape sketches. This particular drawing of an imaginary, idyllic panorama was made as a highly finished, independent work of art and was probably an elaboration of one of his early morning sketches.The composition displays van Uden's most familiar motifs, many of which derive from Peter Paul Rubens's work: cattle and the woman balancing a milk container on her head, the shimmering birch trees at left, and a path leading to a deep vista that opens onto a flat landscape punctuated by a church spire. Sunlight filters through the scintillating leaves of trees on the left, an effect that van Uden so favored that he often made it the focal point of his drawings.
This still-life assembly of mortar, pestle, bottles, vial, and developing tray evokes the element of alchemy in photography. These objects immediately refer to the practice of medicine and to its potential power to stimulate the body's regenerative processes.In a related way, photography can be understood as the artist measuring and applying certain powders and liquids to create an image, one with the power to heal the spirit and to nourish and give life to the imagination and the soul. By photographing the tools of her medium in this arrangement, Doris Ulmann made a concise, eloquent statement aligning photography with a fundamental need to enrich life's experience through art.
Elder William Anderson was a prominent member of the diminishing Shaker sect residing near Mount Lebanon, New York, on the site of the Shakers' original settlement in the 1700s. Raised in New York City, Anderson reportedly arrived in Mount Lebanon seeking  new adventures.  Among other responsibilities there, he oversaw the colony's chairmaking business for forty years and was a respected leader of the community.When Ulmann photographed Anderson, he was deaf and nearly blind.  Here his hands rest upon the pages of a large book held on his lap: he may be reading the book in Braille. Anderson sits tall and upright, a distinguished figure in a simple shirt and suit who appears to be facing either into the distant past or into the future of his approaching death.
 They all want to go and dress up,  Doris Ulmann remarked of her portrait subjects. She preferred to photograph her subjects in their daily wear and in their day-to-day habitats, but clearly the opportunity to have a portrait made without charge proved too tempting to resist for Ulmann's mostly poor subjects. Like most sitters, they chose to have themselves represented at their very best.In this image, Grace Combs appears to be one of those rarely photographed subjects. A natural beauty, Combs comports herself for the camera in a very self-assured, almost seductive pose. She leans on a potted fern, gazing directly into the camera. When this picture was made, Combs was probably a student at Hindman Settlement School in Kentucky.
Doris Ulmann's photographs of Southern black people often seem to idealize their subjects. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ulmann, a woman of means from New York, documented what she perceived to be a vanishing black culture. The woman is posed with her hands in her lap, her lips pursed, and her bespectacled eyes gazing directly at the viewer. While her gingham-checked dress and striped cap are quite lively, her demeanor is calm. Ulmann's sensitive study depicts a woman who, though very different from herself, was equally dignified.
Doris Ulmann made this portrait in South Carolina, where she took summer trips in 1929 and 1930. The subject, known as Maum Duck, has been variously identified as a midwife or voodoo doctor. She is dressed for an outing, possibly for church, wearing a large, textured hat with her delicate pocketbook dangling from her left arm. Her crisp, white cotton dress and the simple, white sheet backdrop contrast sharply with her rich, deep skin tone and her hat and sash. They contrast so much, in fact, that Duck's facial features become somewhat lost in the balance of highlights and shadows. She stands close to the sheet, nearly blending into it as she casts virtually no shadow. The photograph's casual feeling derives from its incidental details: the gentle sag of the backdrop fabric along the top and the triangle of space where it pulls away at the lower right.
InRoll, Jordan, Roll, novelist Julia Peterkin's and Doris Ulmann's collaborative study of the vanishing Gullah culture of coastal blacks in the Southeastern United States, Peterkin described the pivotal age for a girl in Gullah folklore:Twelve is the age of responsibility, when the recording angel in heaven writes a child's name in a book and marks down every sin against it. Under twelve a child is a 'young child,' and if he dies his soul will not fail to reach heaven, but twelve is the deadline age that changes a 'young child' to an 'old child.'This unnamed young girl, perhaps not yet twelve years old, stands within a shaft of shadow. The wall on either side of her is bathed in light, yet she is moored between, in darkness except for her left hip and arm, as if undecided about her path. Ulmann's photograph is a visual metaphor for this crucial period of development described by Peterkin.
This woman is identified only as an herbalist. Doris Ulmann posed her here with what appears to begris-gris, or medicine bags, around her neck; around her waist are several lengths of rags tied with pieces of moss and twigs. With a potted fern and dried leaf on the ledge in front, Ulmann created a kind of occupational portrait, carefully framing the herbalist between the columns of a porch. The woman leans casually and extends a rather large, strong, and masculine-looking hand and forearm forward toward unidentifiable objects on the ledge. With her close-fitting, torn work shirt and wiry, slender build, she is an ambiguous figure, androgynous and possibly of mixed race.
Doris Ulmann photographed members of the Cherokee tribe on a reservation in western North Carolina. In this image she represented an unidentified young woman holding an example of the simple gray pottery that typified the tribe's work. The Cherokee woman holds the vessel carefully on her lap, looking away from the camera with an expression that suggests that she does not recognize herself to be an essential part of the photograph. Her long hair flows loosely over her shoulders, softening her weathered yet handsome face and lending the image an air of timelessness.
The Sisters of the Holy Family were a Catholic, predominantly African American order ofnunslocated in New Orleans's French Quarter. Sister Mary Paul Lewis, dressed in her habit, stands outdoors against a backdrop of lush foliage. Her crucifix hangs prominently on her chest, and her crossed hands cradle her eyeglasses. Although they are held thus for a practical purpose, her hands also reflect a gesture of offering and humility that would have been fundamental to her religious vows and chosen life of service. Doris Ulmann photographed Sister Mary Paul from below; consequently, she looks down slightly at the viewer, maintaining a serene, patient expression consistent with her divine calling.
Doris Ulmann made this portrait of three generations of women basket weavers in preparation for writer Allan Eaton's publicationHandicrafts of the Southern Highlands. A self-taught craftswoman said to have instructed all of the willow basket weavers then active in Knott County, Kentucky, Aunt Cord Ritchie sits in the center, holding a willow basket on her lap. The two younger women hold baskets as well as willow reeds; the unfinished materials convey the fact that they stopped working in order for Ulmann to make the picture. The two older women perch in chairs on the porch while the girl sits at their feet, reinforcing her position as a basketmaking novice and the family's youngest generation.
Jean Thomas, ne Bell, was born in Kentucky and began to collect folk music while traveling as a court stenographer. She founded the American Folk Song Society and wrote nine books about the folklore and music of Kentucky. Doris Ulmann photographed her seated outside of a cabin holding adulcimeron her lap.John Jacob Niles, folklorist, musician, and Ulmann's travel companion, crouches next to Thomas and focuses intently upon her instrument. The standing man is not identified, but the cabin certainly is. Upon it is hung a banner for the second American Folk Song Festival presented by Thomas's American Folk Song Society. The sign above the door,  Traipsin Woman,  probably refers to the title or lyric of one of the songs. A horseshoe, an American flag, and a sickle further confirm the cabin's purpose as a gathering place and working home.
Doris Ulmann photographed woodcarvers, cabinetmakers, cobblers, and many other artisans as part ofHandicrafts of the Southern Highlands, a book by Allan Eaton documenting craft traditions in the Appalachian Mountains. She made many images of the chairmaker Jason Reed, seen here holding a cane and seated on what is probably one of his own creations. Eaton described chairmaking as  rarely a full-time job, most who carry it on being farmers who fill in between the seasons of outdoor work. While Ulmann's assignment was to show Reed at work, here she captured him at rest; in other images, she recorded him playing with his grandchildren. Ulmann's care in portraying all aspects of the man was consistent with her respect for her sitters and her interest in chronicling the culture of the American South.
Funerary scenes decorate both sides of thisApulianred-figurevolute-krater. On the front, a youth and a woman bring offerings to anaiskos, a small funerary shrine. A young man seated in the naiskos holds a theatrical comic mask. Both the naiskos and the seated youth are painted white in order to simulate marble or stone, an indication that the seated figure is actually a statue of the deceased. The mask and the scroll lying on the ground at his feet suggest that he was an actor who chose to have his career commemorated on his funerary monument. The back of the vase depicts a funerarystelewith another pair of offering bearers.The combination of two funerary scenes, one with a naiskos and one with a stele, was a popularmotifon large Apulian funerary vessels of the later 300s B.C. Aside from the main scenes, most of the surface of this vase is covered with elaborate decoration. The intricate design on the neck with a satyr's head sprouting from tendrils, the florals under the handles, and the female heads in the handle volutes are all typical of the relentless ornament favored in the Apulian  Ornate Style. 
On the back of a chair a white cockatoo perches, greedily eyeing the fruit--cherries, figs, grapes, peaches, and pears--that is piled below. Suspended from a metal game crown are birds and a hare; below, more game birds are placed haphazardly on the table. Closer to the viewer, artichokes, cabbages, a watermelon, and vegetable squash are thrown carelessly upon a dark tablecloth. In this abundant display of foodstuffs, Adriaen van Utrecht took great care in juxtaposing different surfaces: translucent grape skins, fruit rinds, bird feathers, rabbit fur, thorny artichoke leaves, and rich velvet cloth.Behind the still life, a window opens to an outside view. No figures are shown, but signs of human presence are everywhere; the gastronomical display on the table describes nature as tamed by man.
Surrounded by a diverse array of onlookers, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius kneels and prepares to raise the holy cross. Barefoot and clad in drab robes, Heraclius has abandoned his fine clothing in order to pass through the gate of Jerusalem with humility. Standing beside Heraclius and clad in a bishop's mitre and white robe is the patriarch of Constantinople, Zachariah. Around this central pair, several spectators have dropped to their knees at the sight of the cross.In 628 A.D., having recovered the true cross from the Persians, Heraclius appeared at the gate of Jerusalem intending to enter in triumph. But as he and his followers approached the gate, stones fell from the walls, blocking his passage. An angel appeared and told him that in his opulent clothes, he could not enter through the same gate that Christ had humbly entered riding on a donkey. The message of this story is clear: the kingdom of heaven is open only to those who have forsaken the riches of the material world.The Exaltation of the Cross, in the form of a narrative series, appeared in several early Renaissance frescoes. But it is a subject rarely represented in painting. Juan de Valds Leal frequently used painted sketches to work out his ideas for large-scale compositions. This oil sketch was created for his last major commission, a monumental fresco to decorate the church of the Hospital de la Caridad in Seville, Spain This preparatory form highlight's Valds Leal's agitated brushwork, thick impasto, vivid coloring, and dramatic sense of movement. Such painterly spontaneity perhaps reflects the spiritual fervor of this famously volatile painter.
Below a rocky acropolis, two women in classical attire converse with each other. The dress and gesture of the standing woman are echoed in the life-size marble sculpture at the right edge of the painting. Another pair of figures is less immediately visible. On a shadowed pathway, they wind their way up the rough hillside toward the citadel. In the distance, sailboats move in and out of shafts of rain as they traverse a thin sliver of turquoise sea.Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes exhibited this landscape at the Salon of 1789. The painting's Salon title, a general one, suggests that its subject is simply an imagined classical past. This is an idyllic and idealized antiquity where human activity and architecture are in harmony with one another and with the natural world.
These stools were part of an order of sixty-four for the French queen Marie-Antoinette'ssalles de jeux(gaming rooms) at the palaces ofFontainebleauand Compigne. Originally covered with painted satin, they were delivered with twelve matching fixed-leg stools (tabourets), a folding screen, and a fire-screen. Their carved decoration consists of typicalNeoclassicalmotifs: oak wreaths, scrolling ribbons, beading, and rosettes.The wooden X-frame base, a traditional design that originated inclassical antiquity, allowed each stool to fold easily once its cushion was removed. Thus they could be easily transported from room to room.
Willem van Aelst's sensual and sumptuous treatment of the dead birds, leather case, and satin drapery in this picture forms an obvious link with his other still-life specialty, collections of luxurious objects. In this hunting trophy picture, van Aelst rendered the brightly colored birds and wide range of surfaces and textures with the same lushness he devoted elsewhere to crystal goblets and silver platters. He painted the birds so carefully that they can be accurately identified: the blue-green one is a kingfisher, the small red one is a Eurasian bullfinch, and the yellow-brown bird is a male bearded tit.Few Dutch artists actually painted dead game and fowl, perhaps because hunting and shooting was not widely practiced in the northern Netherlands. Although a small number of game and fowl still lifes did begin to appear in Holland around 1640, the market for such pictures remained small.
Shown separately or together, as inLandscape withAllegoriesof the Four Elements,the four elements were a popular subject for Jan Brueghel the Younger and his collaborator Hendrik van Balen. Here, earth is represented by the goddessCeres, who is surrounded with asatyr,putti, and a figure holding a sheaf of wheat. Ceres, whose name means  creator,  was the goddess of agriculture, worshiped over a large part of ancient ItalyTogether Jan Brueghel the Younger and Van Balen often painted the four elements, which had also been part of the repertoire of Jan the Younger's father, Jan Brueghel the Elder. Brueghel the Elder taught his son the lush, decorative, yet highly detailed landscape and still life style seen in this painting.Van Balen, one of Jan the Younger's most consistent collaborators, was known for his attractive nudes. This panel was probably one of his latest works; he had begun painting figures for the Brueghel family years before, working with his friend Jan the Elder in addition to collaborating with Frans Snyders and Frans Francken II.
In the busy port of Vlissingen (Flushing) used by theDutch East India Companyin the 1600s, grand ships glide through placid waters. The cannon on a large yacht fires a salute announcing the arrival of a dignitary, who is carried ashore by the launch to the right. By the mid-1600s, the Dutch Republic had reached the height of its power as a global trading empire, and its domination of the seas found expression in thegenreof marine painting. In 1649 Jan van de Cappelle introduced the  parade  picture, in which grand ships convene for a special occasion under dramatic cloudy skies.In this parade picture, Van de Cappelle included many details, such as the ship's rigging, sails, and decorations and dolphins swimming through the calm water. He also mastered the atmospheric and optical effects seen in the treatment of reflections in the water and in the contrast between the lighter clouds that form at the horizon and the darker ones gathering high above theforeground.
Who is this woman  She sits nude, her left arm outstretched while her right reaches up to grasp it, with a small cloth draped modestly across her lap. Her high forehead, small eyes, long torso, and muscular legs lead scholars to guess that Adriaen van de Velde produced this drawing from a living model rather than an idealized figure.Choosing black chalk instead of the more traditional red, van de Velde softly shaded her body, adding delicate whiteheighteningfor the highlights. The cool colors of the black and white chalks and gray-toned paper complement the refined and delicate modeling of the figure. This subtlety contrasts with the broadly applied chalk strokes that set her off from the background. Van de Velde particularly emphasized the dark shadows beneath her legs and right arm, as well as the softer shadows around her back and upper thigh.
Adriaen van de Velde habitually ventured out in the countryside to sketch cattle and landscapes for his paintings. Before ever beginning a painting, he made a preliminary compositional sketch, proceeded to chalk studies of the animals and figures, and then completed a finished drawing.Departing from the usual norm of his animal drawings, van de Velde placed this cow not in a natural setting but in a close-up, seen from an angle that accentuates the animal's block-like form. Her neck, left shoulder, and head catch the sun directly, while light rakes across her back to reveal muscled forequarters, a protruding belly, and sunken hindquarters above the udder.
The identity of the sitter of this bust-length portrait is unknown but her costume indicates that she was a woman of considerable wealth. She wears a dark bodice, trimmed at the neck with a lace ruffle and a fur cape complemented by a fine necklace. An ornate headdress and, above her right temple, a jeweled pin with a plume of osprey feathers, complete her ensemble. Although formally attired, the young woman shows a slight smile and subtly tilts her head.Jan van de Velde's drawing technique derived from his training as an engraver. He used a variety of fine, hatched lines to describe the soft contours of the face and distinctive texture of the fur. In capturing this likeness on a small sheet of precious vellum, Van de Velde also displays a miniaturist's touch; for example, the osprey plume is composed out of a handful of thin, parallel strokes.
In this harbor scene, small craft loaded with barrels of supplies hover around a large vessel as men lift various goods on board. Using ropes, four men try to prepare a load to be taken onto the ship. Three men in broad-brimmed hats stand supervising on the left, while other sailors await the goods or attend to other vessels.Using brown ink, Willem van de Velde the Elder outlined the boats and gave definition to ropes and shipping tackle. In contrast, he used a blue-graywashto give volume and depth, using only a few simple strokes to suggest the folds of the sails. Building up the human figures by blending wash and ink, he made quick, sure lines that evoke each gesture and costume without many specific details. As the official artist for the Dutch fleet for many years, van de Velde often recorded such scenes of the bustling activity of marine life. Someone extensively incised the drawing for transfer, even down to the fine details, but no related copy is known today.
A fiery glow charges the sky in Aert van der Neer's view along the New Amstel River. While most Dutch landscape painters in the 1600s used cloud-filled blue skies to endow their work with a powerful presence, van der Neer mastered thegenreof nocturnal landscapes. In this painting, the moon commands attention. Its light is filtered over the scene, emphasizing the river's watery surface and the outlines of trees and reeds. Two small figures at right are also highlighted by the moonlight.Van der Neer usually depicted imaginary places in his landscape paintings. In this rare example, however, he painted an identifiable landmark, the Castle Kostverloren. The evocative river setting, painted inside a studio, is not accurate. During the 1600s, Dutch artists typically composed idealized scenes with imaginary skies while indoors.
Mercurywas messenger toJupiterand served aspatronof travel, commerce, science, and thievery in Greek and Roman mythology. Johan Gregor van der Schardt shows the young, athletic figure of Mercury, identified by the winged sandals and hat he wears and thecaduceushe carries, as he effortlessly returns from flight. Van der Schardt suggested the spontaneity of his landing through the asymmetry of his body: Mercury tilts his head and twists his body so that his right hip comes forward while his right shoulder swings back.Mercurywascast hollowfrom a wax model. After casting, the hair and parts of the wings and sandals were reworked with chisels to accentuate their crispness. In the late sixteenth century, the Getty Museum'sMercurybelonged to Paul Praun, a Nuremberg collector who lived in Bologna and assembled a legendary art collection there.
Night clocks were designed to indicate the hours with a dialilluminatedfrom behind with an oil lamp. In this way, the numbers would have been visible in a dark or dimly lighted room. They never became very popular, however, as keeping the lamp alight through the night required constant care, either by refueling or trimming the wick.This timepiece was a collaborative effort of several of the most skilled artists who worked for theMedicifamily in Florence, including Leonard van der Vinne and Giovanni Battista Foggini. In addition, the statue of the boar mounted on the top may have been modeled by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, based on aclassicalmarble statue in the Uffizi. The clock's architectural shape copies the form of churchaltarpieces, while its elaborate stone decoration includes both flat scrolls inmosaicsand innovative three-dimensional fruit garlands at the sides. The mechanism was created by Francesco Papillion.
Inspired by a series of apostles that Rubens painted in 1610 for the Duke of Lerma, Spain's chief minister, Anthony van Dyck set about making his own similar series, including this painting of the Apostle Simon. Simon is shown bust-length, his head turned so that his profile is  lost  or partially obscured by shadow. His left hand rests on a saw, the instrument of his martyrdom. Light falls from the top left, creating highlights and deep shadows across his head, face, hand, and clothing. Draperies are broadly painted and richly colored, while the apostle's hair, eyebrows, and beard are finely painted to convey their wavy, silky texture.
Both sides of this sheet show scenes of the Entombment, probably in preparation for a painting that does not survive or was never completed. Anthony van Dyck based his composition on a painting by Titian, which he knew from a copy by Peter Paul Rubens. Van Dyck exchanged Titian's sweeping horizontal composition for a more tightly integrated, vertical format, allowing him to give greater prominence to the shrouded Virgin, who holds the arm of her dead son. The gracefully turning form of Saint John the Evangelist at the center links the two figures flanking Christ.Van Dyck demonstrated his virtuosity by using a variety of techniques and media in his characteristically intense, heavily washed, and broadly drawn style. After sketching in black chalk, he drew the figures in pen and ink and went over much of the composition with strokes of dark brown wash. He also drew a rough framing line around the composition. The extremely fine pen lines left visible on Christ's torso lend it poignant beauty, while the wash adds drama and movement.
Depicted three-quarter length, the Earl of Arundel sits before a tapestry curtain on the left and a landscape background on the right. The long, tapering fingers of his left hand hold the goldmedallionof Saint George, one of theemblemsworn by the twenty-four knights who made up the most eminent and noble circle around the king. His elongated, pale face contrasts with the white ruff around his neck and the scarlet chair upon which he sits. Turned slightly towards the viewer, the expression on Arundel's face is alert but reserved.Arundel was one of the great patrons and collectors of art in England in the early 1600s. He was best known for his collection of Venetian paintings, which included works by Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. During a brief first visit to London around 1621, Anthony van Dyck was commissioned to paint this portrait for Arundel, who recognized the young artist's talent.
Agostino Pallavicini, a member of the Genoese branch of the Pallavicini family and the future doge of Genoa, sits enveloped by the sumptuous, flowing red robes worn in his role as ambassador to the Pope. The wide expanse of fabric, spectacularly rendered, seems to have a life of its own and almost threatens to take over the painting. The luxurious swirl of cloth, its brilliant sheen, and the way it glimmers and reflects light display Anthony van Dyck's virtuosity as a painter. The family coat of arms seen on the drapery behind the sitter at the left, along with other documented portraits, firmly establishes Pallavicini's identity.In 1621 Van Dyck left Antwerp and traveled to Italy, where he stayed for five years, viewing large private collections of Italian paintings and painting various portraits. This was one of the first paintings he made in Italy, painted in 1621 to commemorate the sitter's service as an ambassador to the newly elected Pope Gregory XV.
Anthony Van Dyck's former teacher, Hendrick van Balen, lived in Antwerp and painted religious and mythological themes. Van Dyck made this portrait as a study for a print that was part of a series known asThe Iconography. This series was a collection of portraits of distinguished artists, soldiers, statesmen, administrators, and scholars of the early 1600s.Using only black chalk, Van Dyck created a striking characterization of his old teacher. By placing Van Balen's right hand on the head of an antique bust while his left presses a soft cloth close to his chest, Van Dyck effectively suggested the erudition and refined personality of his mentor.
Near death after being tied to a tree and shot through with arrows, Saint Sebastian barely notices the angel helping to remove them. Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance.Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.
Amidst the soft, feathery trees in this English landscape, a subtly rendered house at the right suggests a human presence. Though this country view seems spontaneous, the scene is thoughtfully arranged around the prominent central tree. Anthony van Dyck's rich and translucent colors and the freshness of his watercolor and pen accents lend an almost impressionistic tone to the drawing.Van Dyck regularly sketched from life during relaxed interludes, all the while successfully creating coherent, unified compositions. This watercolor probably records a momentary impression created while at leisure, but it may also have served as a study for the background of a painting. While in England, van Dyck developed a pastoral style that often presented portrait sitters in a landscape.
 I also did a bleaching ground at Scheveningen right on the spot, washed in at one sitting, almost without preparation, on a piece of very coarse Torchon [paper],  Vincent van Gogh wrote on 26 July 1882.Displaying his early accomplishment after only six months of working in and around The Hague, the recto and verso of this drawing together offer a fascinating glimpse into van Gogh's working process. He probably began by drawing the Scheveningen woman on the verso. Possibly dissatisfied with its murky effect, he may also have cut down the sheet to its current dimensions. Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field.With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape. Divergent and well-observed details combine into a single overall scheme, conveying a sense of open outdoor space. Masterfully handling a difficult medium, van Gogh revealed the luminosity of watercolor and hinted at the expressiveness and colorful palette of his art to come.
 A good soul and so wise and so full of feeling and so trustful --thus Vincent van Gogh described his friend Joseph-Etienne Roulin. Van Gogh drew and painted many portraits of Roulin, a postal worker in Arles, where Van Gogh lived from 1888 to 1889. In letters and pictures, Van Gogh idealized Roulin, regarding him as both a man of the people and a sage.Facing frontally, Roulin is pushed close to the picture plane, with his eyes looking slightly wistfully to the side. Van Gogh's energetic lines describe Roulin's full beard, his facial structure, and his somewhat crooked nose. With the dark, thick lines of a reed pen, Van Gogh hatched the vibrating coat and cap. Behind Roulin, a patchwork of nervous, intersecting lines drawn with a quill pen creates an overall surface tension, reinforcing the energy emanating from the sitter and the unsettled nature of his gaze.
Vincent van Gogh made this drawing in varied hues of golden brown ink as a study of a painting. The vertical composition, whereby forms grow smaller and denser as the eye moves up, leads the eye across the stubble of a newly cut wheat field framed by gathered stacks of wheat. In the center, a man scythes a section of the field while a woman bundles cut wheat under her arm. The background shifts to the cityscape of Arles, where churches and densely packed houses stretch across the horizon. A railroad train and factories churning smoke into the sky signal the dawn of the machine world and its effect on traditional ways of life.This drawing embodies many of the characteristic features of van Gogh's work: remarkably varied graphic strokes, a subject matter that comments on the human condition, a golden glow that suggests the warm light of southern France, and a balanced yet dynamic composition.
In May 1889, after episodes of self-mutilation and hospitalization, Vincent van Gogh chose to enter an asylum in Saint-Rmy, France. There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he beganIrises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints.There are no known drawings for this painting; Van Gogh himself considered it a study. His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to theSalon des Indpendantsin September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition:  [It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life. Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines. The painting's first owner, French art critic Octave Mirbeau, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters, wrote:  How well he has understood the exquisite nature of flowers! 
Martin van Heemskerck chose to show theOld TestamentheroineJudithat her moment of triumph, holding up the decapitated head ofHolofernes, an Assyrian general. The Assyrians had besieged Judith's city, but when the inhabitants were on the point of capitulating, she developed a plan to save them. Dressing herself so as to catch the eye of any man who might see her, Judith entered the enemy camp and quickly entranced the general with her beauty. He invited her to his tent with plans to seduce her, but became too drunk. She was therefore able to grab his sword and sever his head.The decapitated body of Holofernes, with its gushing wound, lies on a canopied bed in the elaborate tent to the right. Judith herself wears an intricate armored breastplate over her richly embroidered clothes. In the distance, the other Assyrian tents cluster outside the city walls, while the army marches up to the gate.Van Heemskerck's careful cross-hatching and neat penwork indicate that this was a final version of this drawing. It was then passed to a printmaker to be copied for the engraving of Judith in the series of six prints illustratingGood Women of the Old Testament.
The wordsPan e vin e va cantando(Bread and wine and merriment) float around the body of this bottle in fluid script, elaborately engraved with supple and complex flourishes. On the underside of the vessel, another inscription adds:kan't Brood en [...] Wijn niet doen  Wat Zouts kan't Mael vergon(If bread and wine fail to do so, a little pinch of salt can save a meal).In the mid-1600s, calligraphic engraving, such as the lettering around this vessel, was mainly the hobby of wealthy amateurs in the northern Netherlands. Both men and women enjoyed practicing their calligraphic skills by decorating bottles, plates, beakers, and other glass vessels with elaborate lettering. One of the most accomplished of these was Willem Jacobszoon van Heemskerk, who engraved and signed this bottle on its base. Heemskerk was an able engraver and an inspired designer who covered the surface of his glass vessels with pithy adages in delicate script. He built up the elegantly spaced characters and abundant scrolls from parallel scratches made with a diamond point.
A colossal tree extending beyond the top of the sheet dominates this forest interior. The tree bends sharply leftward, its craggy branches forming a decorative canopy of leaves. To its left, a more modestly scaled and more lightly rendered tree almost appears to recoil away from its towering companion. But even the smallest trees reach well above the cluster of peasants standing in front of a thatched roof cottage. One figure in this group points toward the luminous glade in the middle distance.Near the end of his career, Paulus van Liender produced a series of drawings of wooded landscapes, including this large work, for which he became best known. The forests around Utrecht and Haarlem could have inspired this work of art but the careful arrangement of trees and foliage and decorative patterning of light and shadow, suggest that the scene was a product of Van Liender's imagination.
By the sweet wound of thy piercing darts, . . . revenge the injury which is done to thy mother, by the false and disobedient beauty of a mortal maiden . . . that she may fall in love with the most miserable creature living, the most poor, the most crooked, and the most vile . . .In an event from one of the greatest love stories in Greek mythology, Cupid stands with his arrow poised to strike, while his mother Venus points to his target, the mortal Psyche. Because of Psyche's beauty, people had begun to worship her rather than Venus. Outraged at this mortal usurping her honor, Venus commanded Cupid to avenge her. Cupid, however, foiled his mother's plans, and Psyche did not fall in love with any such wretched creature. Having pricked himself with his own arrow so that he would love Psyche, Cupid protected her. His enraged mother subjected the lovers to many trials before their eventual marriage.Pieter van Lint copied this subject from the corner of a curved ceiling in a Roman villa that was painted by Raphael's pupils in 1518. He accurately repeated the foreshortening of the figures, but he exaggerated the voluminous proportions of the female nude.
A female nude with both halves of her body balanced in a relatively straightforwardcontrappostopose stands with arms outstretched. Karel van Mander first sketched the figure lightly in black chalk, next shaded it in wash, and finally added the swelling and tapering pen work. He drew only what was essential: small circles form her breasts, the eyes and mouth appear through quick dots of ink, and a single swirling stroke delineates her hair. The sure ink lines and lack of correction display van Mander's instinctive draftsmanship.As part of their teaching at the drawing school they formed, known as the Haarlem Academy, Van Mander and his friends made sketches of single nude figures, often in strikingly difficult, contorted poses. This drawing represents a relatively restrained example of thegenre.
In this scene, Isack van Ostade presented an idealized view of the town of Eindhoven, depicting rustic buildings covered by lacy foliage. His charming vista begins at the right with a rustic house with a thatched roof.Van Ostade's delicatewashand penwork create a picturesque view of rural Holland. During the 1600s in Holland,genreand landscape pictures became popular with city dwellers wanting to recreate in their own homes their enjoyable experiences in the local countryside. To meet the demand for such subjects artists often made picturesque landscape drawings, like this one, which were sold on the open market.In his paintings, van Ostade specialized in large-scale summer and winter views of Holland that are usually crowded with figures. Here he instead focused on the charms of the rustic townscape.
Neither moralist nor social critic, Adriaen van Ostade aimed only to capture the lively spirit of his peasant subjects' daily activities. He animated this scene with lively penwork but also exploited the potential of watercolor. His thin, translucent washes allowed the white of the paper to show through. In brilliant colors, they suffuse the whole street with luminous, airy sunlight. The vivid yet delicate pastel hues give the earthy subject matter an air of refinement that would have appealed to contemporary collectors.Dutch taste for such finished drawings grew throughout the 1600s. By late in the century, draftsmen were creating highly finished, extensively colored compositions and selling these elaborate drawings as small paintings.Van Ostade painted many peasant scenes, often repeating elements. This drawing's diagonal placement of space, the principal figure groups, the smoker seen from behind, and the man facing front with his leg extended frequently appear in other paintings and drawings.
This image commemorates the 1919 South American tour of Anna Pavlova's dance troupe, which included performances of the Persian-inspired ballet  La Pri,  originally created by Theophile Gautier for the great Italian ballerina Carlotta Grisi. Hubert Stowitts re-conceived the ballet in 1917 with new choreography and the costumes seen here.
This armored warrior on horseback holding a shield withMedusa'shead probably represents a figure from myth or ancient history, perhaps the Roman heroMarcus Curtius. The horse and rider's out-flung limbs create intersecting diagonal axes, conveying a sense of explosive movement. To balance thecomposition, the rider sits far back on the horse. This position also assures the stability of the bronze, the weight of which rests solely on the horse's two rear legs. Although the rider's lithe, attenuated body expresses aManneristconception of anatomical proportions, the composition's vigorous thrusting is more typical of theBaroque.Artisans cast the piece in several sections using thelost-wax method, then joined the separate pieces withplugs. The surface shows little evidence of muchchasingafter casting.
The mining camp of La Rancherie was located near the fabled Sutter's Mill in California, where gold was discovered in 1849. In the volatile gold-rush environment of prospectors, get-rich-quick dreams, and fly-by-night towns, an assembly of men in the foreground stood for the camera to immortalize their roles in the historical moment. La Rancherie stood out for its stability: it could boast a few buildings made of clapboard and some that were even painted. The illustrated hotel sign at upper left indicates a clientele that was not entirely literate and might rely on pictures to identify potential lodgings.
As a result of the vast popularity ofdaguerreotypesin America, they quickly became relatively inexpensive. For the first time in recorded history, working-class people could afford to have their portraits made. They often chose to be shown with the tools of their trade.Sometimes these portraits were early forms of advertising, as suggested by this jewelry vendor, who proudly displays his cased wares and trinkets.
Themarchand-mercierDominique Daguerre purchased the porcelain plaques that decorate the sides of this table from the Svres Porcelain Manufactory specifically to be mounted on furniture. Once ordered from Svres, the porcelain plaques, including the unusually-shaped ones at either end of the table, would have been given by the dealer to thebnisteMartin Carlin with orders tomountthem onto a newly designed piece.This table was among the pieces of furniture that Daguerre sold in May 1782 to Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna and Grand Duke Paul Petrovich of Russia, who later became the Czar and Czarina. They made an unofficial trip through Europe traveling as the comte and comtesse du Nord. The Duchess installed the table in her bedroom at the Palace of Pavlosk, near Saint Petersburg.
Numerous new types of furniture appeared in France in the 1700s with varied and specialized functions. This bedside cabinet was decorated on all four sides so that it could be placed wherever it was needed in the room. The tambour door at the top slides back, revealing a marble lined shelf that would have been used to hold a chamber pot. The doors below conceal two sets of drawers. At the right side is a drawer that once contained writing materials: a gilt bronze inkpot, a pot for sand, and a sponge box.
This drawing illustrates Christ's agony, as recounted in the Gospel of Saint Luke:  He himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray: 'Father, if it be thy will, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but thine be done.' And now there appeared to him an angel from heaven bringing him strength, and in anguish of spirit he prayed the more urgently; and his sweat was like clots of blood falling to the ground. Angels descend from the heavens to surround and support the agonized Christ in the moments preceding his arrest. One offers Jesus the cup that symbolizes his acceptance of death on the cross. A powerful, iridescent light floods his body from the heavens above, imbuing the scene with a transparent glow.The elaborate finish and large size of this drawing suggest that Carle Vanloo intended it as an independent work of art. Although there is no trace of a connected painting, it may have been presented to a patron for approval of a commission.
A heavenly light emanating from the Christ child in the manger casts a glow over the faces of both his parents, who crouch before him in the gloom. As the Virgin Mary kneels beside her son's bed, lines of white gouache highlight the folds in her dress, her forehead, nose, and chin. An ox and an ass lean over her shoulder to nibble at the hay in the manger, ignoring the baby in the basket. The figure of Saint Joseph also glows from the light cast from the left, while his back remains in the inky darkness. Above the stable numerous angels and cherubs hover, watching the events below. The angel Gabriel floats in the center of the drawing, while the others cluster around in the clouds and even peak through the crib. The elaborate technique, high degree of detail, and squaring all lead scholars to believe that Francesco Vanni made this work in preparation for a painting, although no known work corresponds to it.
The elegant figure of this saint, which fully dominates the space of the initialI, is notable for its strong, monumental bearing.  The artist employed a warm, glowing palette of gold and orange, endowing the figure with a luminous quality appropriate to a holy person.The initial, cut from an antiphonal, probably introduced a generic text devoted to martyrs, which was individualized by the insertion of a particular saint's name. The saint shown is thus not a specific person but a composite martyr accompanied by the attributes of a number of saints who died for the Christian faith.  The wool comb at the figure's feet was an instrument used to torture Saint Blasius, the rocks could refer to the stoning of Saint Stephen, the fire may refer to Saint Lawrence who was roasted alive, and the swords could indicate any number of martyr saints. Finally, the palm frond is a symbol of the martyr's triumph over death in the Christian afterlife.
Giorgio Vasari made these two studies as side panels for a tripartite painting in the ceiling of a Naples monastery. The central panel is now lost, though scholars believe that it depicted theFeast in the House of Simon, the New Testament event at which Mary Magdalene anointed Christ while Judas prepared to betray him.Vasari depicted the figures in Roman attire so viewers in the 1500s would understand that the painting tells a Biblical story. The entertaining spectacle of waiters serving food and drink illustrates Vasari's use of religious motifs to draw scenes of everyday life. On the left a bearded man fills a glass, surrounded by vases in various fantastic forms, while on the right two young men rush plates of steaming food to the table.
Drawing from life, Giorgio Vasari made this study for a figure of an armed ringleader representing a Florentine neighborhood in a ceiling painting. In the final painting, the figure's odd gestures are understandable: he tugs on his beard and rests his arm on his sword. Vasari left the crossed leg somewhat indistinct because he knew that a shield would mask the leg in the painting; he may not yet have decided on the pose of the head when he made this drawing. The brief drapery study at the upper right seems to relate to the cloth covering the figure's upper arm in the painting.The painted figure, one of the thirty-nine paintings in Vasari's decorative scheme, occupies a roundel at the west end of a vast coffered ceiling in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. Illustrating the city's triumphant battles against Pisa and Siena, the painting celebrated Florentine power in Tuscany.
Giorgio Vasari created this study of scenes from the Last Judgment for one of his final projects-the fresco decoration for the interior of the cupola of Florence's renowned cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, more commonly referred to as Brunelleschi's dome. This drawing is for the southeast section of the cupola. The pictorial scheme is divided into eight segments in five concentric zones. Vasari arranged the scenes according to a Counter-Reformation formula: At the top, an Elder of the Apocalypse, angels, and helmeted holy figures appear bearing instruments of the Passion. Below that are the Divine Tribune of Saints and an Archangel, flanked by Fortitude and Patience, who greets the saved rising from Purgatory. At the lower right, naked figures condemned for their sins are thrust into the jaws of a demonic beast. Vasari only partially finished the cupola fresco before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccaro completed the decoration, with some changes to Vasari's design.
The delicate patterns of the feathers on this ruff, a species of sandpiper (Philomachus pugnax), fascinated Gerardus van Veen. He chose a static, rather flat, profile view to set off the shape and texture of the bird's plumage, which he drew exquisitely with the point of a brush. When shown from the side, the bird's plumed ruff, protruding from its breast, appears more pronounced and the long, narrow beak is more noticeable. Van Veen produced the delicatetonaleffect of the feathers by building up layers of watercolor and bodycolor over black chalk. His sure, light touch is particularly evident in the bird's white  petticoats. Scholars believe Van Veen produced this study for a wealthy naturalist such as Agnes Block, who probably commissioned other bird studies from him. He specialized in producing refined natural history illustrations in watercolors for rich clients, many of whom owned country houses outside Amsterdam.
These panels once formed the pinnacles of the wings of a now-dismembered portablealtarpiece. A double-tiered central panel originally depicted theMadonna and Childbelow aCrucifixion. The triple-tiered side panels featured pairs of standing saints, with the Getty Museum'sAnnunciationpanels forming the apex.Kneeling, theArchangel Gabrielgreets the Virgin at the moment of Christ'sIncarnation. In the form of a dove, theHoly Spiritdescends, flying close to the Virgin's face. Paolo Veneziano skillfully placed his figures within the difficult confines of the small trapezoidal space. The depiction of Mary's throne presented a challenge to the artist, but he set it at an angle thus, giving a sense of depth. He used the space above Gabriel by sweeping the angel's wings upwards so that the feathery ends touch the point where the frame meets the panel. The Virgin's facial features, her hieratic pose, and the decorative patterning of her dress and the cloth of honor draping her throne all illustrateByzantineconventions of the past. But the figure of Gabriel shows a more modern influence: The innovations of Giotto and other Tuscan artists are seen in the way Veneziano has given the figure a weightiness and bulk achieved through sculptural modeling.
Adriaen van de Venne captured the idle pleasures of courtship and leisure in this small painting. Lining a wide lane, an assortment of people watch a game of ball. To the left, a formal garden with flowers and sculptures is laid out in front of a large fantasy castle. In the left foreground, two lovers sit in shadow near an overturned lute and a pile of clothing discarded by the ballplayers. On the right is an enclosed forest area with goats and deer.This painting and its companion,A Merry Company in an Arbor, were part of a series of four landscapes representing the seasons. This painting probably represents summer. Both paintings have aminiatureand jewel-like quality, with similar colorful scenes of tiny, anecdotal figures out in the open.
At the left of this small landscape, a group of maidens make music under an arbor of flowers. In an enclosed area to the right, two women sit on a net used for catching finches. From all sides youths spy on the women, perching in trees or hiding behind bushes or tree trunks. One bold voyeur clings to the top of the arbor, peering down at the women below. Another, entangled in a net, is apprehended by a soberly dressed woman, while two jesters above have fallen out of the trees.This light-hearted painting by Adriaen van de Venne was part of a series of four landscapes representing the seasons. This painting, thought to represent spring, and its companion,A Jeu de Paume Before a Country Palace(A Ball Game Before a Country Palace), both include imagery relating to love.
A bent, old woman carrying a cat leans forward to take a quick puff on the clay pipe offered to her by a bearded man. The man's belly protrudes into the center of the scene, almost touching the woman's hand. Bagpipes, often used to symbolize sexual prowess, hang from his belt. In the background, a boy pats a dog while an older man taps on the old woman's shoulder. The single flame of a lamp and a crescent moon that peeps out from behind the clouds are the only sources of illumination in this night scene. Adriaen van de Venne used sharp contrasts in lighting to emphasize the deep creases in the bearded man's face, his grubby hands, and the coarse wool of the elderly woman's skirt.
In the crowded interior of a forge, the gaunt figure of a blacksmith looks over his shoulder to observe his apprentices, who wear aprons like their master. Engaged in a gluttonous rampage, some raid the cupboards, while another takes food from a woman with a begging child. Tools lie strewn across the floor. As the smith is distracted from his work, the object that he holds in the flame flies apart. Various spectators stop outside the windows and at the top of the stairs to observe the chaotic scene, and an old woman slumped on a chair in the corner symbolizes Laziness, indicating that the scene might represent the popular Netherlandish theme ofSorghelos Leven(carefree living). The moralizing story warns the viewer against the extravagant waste of time, effort, and goods.Jan Verbeeck covered this sheet with dense hatching, enveloping every part of the surface with lines to effectively increase the sense of chaos in the scene.
Although represented in the artificial format of a bust, cut off at mid-chest, the marble statue of Jacob van Reygersberg nevertheless strikes the viewer with its extraordinaryrealism. The sculptor Rombout Verhulst conveyed the figure's motion and spontaneity through the twisted head, furrowed brow, and pursed lips. Verhulst's facility in differentiating textures--Van Reygersberg's shield has a smooth hardness, his cravat a lacy delicacy, and his skin an unusual, satiny texture-heightens the realism. Decorative scrolls, which also lead the viewer's gaze up toward the subject's face, is soften the figure's sudden truncation at mid-chest.Jacob van Reygersberg was a wealthy provincial politician who had recently been sent to the States General, the national governing body of the Netherlands, to represent the Dutch province of Zeeland. His armor identifies him as a member of the noble class.
The shipwreckedTrojanprinceAeneas, shown on the right, arrives at the court ofDido, the legendary queen and founder ofCarthage. Hands upraised, Dido and members of her court react in surprise at the appearance of the splendidly uniformed warrior. Others point knowingly toVenusandCupid, who appear in the upper corner. It was Cupid who made Dido fall hopelessly in love with Aeneas. Although not shown here, the episode will end sadly; prompted by Aeneas' inevitable departure, Dido commits suicide.This densely packed theatrical scene is taken fromVirgil'sAeneid. Nicolas Verkolye placed the figures in a stage-like setting with classically inspired architecture. Through light, shadow, and gesture, he dramatically relates the story of the ill-fated lovers.
Surrounded by attendants and seated at a round table before a tiled, outdoor pavilion, the Chinese emperor and empress enjoy a light meal. While the imperial couple are served tea and fruit, a servant reaches up behind them to remove a platter from a buffet of golden dishes and blue-and-white porcelain arranged in the European fashion. Seated on a stool to the left, a female musician with a monkey at her feet plays a stringed instrument resembling a sitar. In the center, a dwarf dances to her music, while to the right a maid drops incense into a golden incense burner.A large carpet covers the platform on which the emperor and empress sit. The edge of the carpet is woven with the inscription of Guy-Louis Vernansal, who was the chief designer of the tapestry series known asThe Story of the Emperor of China.
In one tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, a woman standing at the left, possibly the Chinese empress, gestures with her fan toward the tropical bounty and beyond to the six-storied pagoda and other buildings in the distance. The tapestry's foreground shows a field of pineapples and other plants, including a palm and a tall banana tree.The first pineapple grown in France had been given to the King of France, Louis XIV, but the fruit was still rare in the early 1700s and its form was probably unknown to the Beauvais artists who wove the tapestry. They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.
In a tapestry from the set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, four attendants carry the Emperor in a palanquin. Two guards on horseback follow the procession, one wearing a sword and bearing the imperial banner and the other carrying a quiver of arrows over his shoulder. The path in front is strewn with cut flowers, apparently from baskets like the one that remains in the center bottom, resting on the border. Birds fill the air above and the palace is visible in the distance.
In a tapestry from the set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, a terraced outdoor pavilion is the setting for the return from the hunt. The emperor, still wearing his quiver and holding his bow, leads the empress down the carpeted steps to show her the catch of game: a deer, waterfowl, and other birds. Behind them stands a large, elaborate throne with sphinxes at each armrest and carved, winged dragons on top. Peacock feathers fan from the crest, and jewels line its upper edge.The double arcade that arches over the throne is a whimsical structure created by the Beauvais artists rather than an authentic Chinese form. This fantastic architecture with its spindly Gothic ornament may have inspired designers of the late 1700s and early 1800s who copied the mixture of Gothic and Far Eastern motifs. This series may be one of the earliest examples of the emergingchinoiseriestyle, in which Westerners employed exotic Chinese forms combined with European motifs.
The Offering toBacchus, which shows a decorated pavilion housing a white marble statue of Bacchus, is one of a series of six tapestries known as theGrotesquesseries. The light subject matter and whimsical decoration appealed to a wide range of purchasers, and theGrotesquesbecame one of the most popular sets produced by the Beauvais manufactory. For over forty years, wealthy patrons ordered hangings from the series.Not only the decorative subject matter, which contrasted with the more formal biblical and historical themes of other contemporary tapestry series, but also the flexibility of the design made it popular. Weavers could easily adapt the composition and change the dimensions to fit a specific location without losing the meaning of the design. The orange-brown color of the background, known astabac d'Espagne(Spanish tobacco), also became extremely fashionable, and a few individuals ordered matching furniture upholstery to complement this unusual shade.
As imagined by a French designer of luxury goods, who had probably never been to China, the wife of the Chinese emperor Shun Chi embarks on a pleasure boat ride. Three servants attend the empress, one of whom plays a portable keyboard instrument and sings. Other musicians, acrobats, dancing rats, and monkeys entertain her from the landing.Originally one of a popular, frequently woven set of ten tapestries, this particular subject,  The Empress Sailing,  was least common among the series. Only one other surviving example is known.Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, commissioned this specific tapestry as part of a set for his country residence outside Paris. Nine tapestries from his set are known to survive, each with borders of the same design, including his monogramLAin the four blue ovals of the border. The Getty Museum owns seven tapestries from this set.
A painting by Nicolas Poussin,The Triumph of Pan, inspired the figures in this square-shaped tapestry, which include dancing women with tambourines, a goat, and a statue of Pan--the Greek god of flocks and fertility. They symbolize the sort of revelry inspired by Pan and the wine god Bacchus, who were celebrated at lively feasts during antiquity.The three female dancers and a young jester perform on a checkered floor in a narrow space partially enclosed by a balustrade and potted fruit trees. The statue of Pan stands beneath an ornate canopy in the center of this arcade. Columns on either side of the statue support an architectural cornice adorned with floral bouquets and a peacock. A large eagle hovers directly above.Befitting the tapestry's theme of honoring Pan, the border features a recliningchinoiseriefigure imbibing a cup of wine. Scrolls, floral bouquets, exotic birds, and hybrid human figures complete the ornate border design.
By the late 1600s, exotic creatures like camels were familiar to the French, who knew of them from classical writers like Aristotle and Pliny and from accounts in medieval bestiaries. At least some of the beasts may have been drawn from life at the royal menagerie at Versailles.In addition to animals and birds--a camel, leopard, lion, peacock, and parrots--this tapestry features human figures. These theatrical performers wear half-masks, and were based on characters from a popular form of street theater, theCommedia Dell' Arte(Comedy of Art). On the tapestry's left side, a violinist and a tambourine player accompany a tightrope walker. On the right, a jesterlike figure tends to the camel. Between them, cherubs perform precariously from ropes hanging down from a central cornice, with a peacock perched below them. Above, parrots balance on canopies hung beneath two trellises and amidst an assortment of swags, urns, and other ornate elements.Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, who designed this tapestry, is best known as an artist of floral still-life paintings in the Dutch tradition. The enormous bouquet in the tapestry's center reflects his specialty-floral paintings produced for the court at Versailles.
Across an expansive field of golden orange, musicians perform on a stage filled with suspended, gravity-defying objects. This saturated background color-a novelty in the late 1600s-acts as a foil for the blue, green, and red elements, which are arranged with theatrical flair amid columns, trellises, and drapery.The musicians and dancers are based on characters from theCommedia Dell'Arte(Comedy of Art), a form of Italian burlesque theater performed by traveling troupes. In the street, the performers would act out standard plots with improvised dialogue. The figures here seem engrossed in dancing or playing their instruments: a triangle, panpipes, flute, guitar, and horn.The tapestry's border is an allegory of the five senses-taste, touch, sight, hearing, and smell. Recurring decorative motifs include floral bouquets, squirrels, parrots, satyrs, sphinxes, andchinoiseriefigures.
In a tapestry from a set known asThe Story of the Emperor of Chinaseries, the empress sits cross-legged on a large cushion beneath a small domed pavilion in the open air. A maid shields her from the sun with a parasol, while two others serve her fruit and tea. To the right, a square table holds a large metal ewer and a basket with various glass and blue-and-white porcelain vessels. Floral swags hang from the poles of the pavilion, and a circlet of flowers is suspended in the middle.
The French kingLouis XVpresented Germain-Louis Chauvelin, his Keeper of Seals, with this tapestry, originally one of a set of ten. Known as aportire, it would have hung across the door of a formal room to keep out drafts. Its prominent heraldic symbols would have clearly announced to visitors the importance of its owner and royal donor. Displayed under a gilded and tasseled canopy, the royalcoat of armsappears against an ermine-lined mantle. The arms rest upon a gilt metal box decorated with fleur-de-lis and L's, the king's initial, representing the casket for the royal seals. The tapestry's wide border contains crossed maces, attributes of the keeper of seals; Chauvelin's monogram of interlaced C's; and his coat of arms in the four corners.Around 1680,Louis XIVbegan a tradition of presenting his chancellor or his keeper of seals with a set of tapestries from the Gobelins tapestry manufactory. A powerful figure in the 1600s and 1700s, the keeper of seals acted as minister of justice and was second in command to the chancellor of France. The chancellor represented the person of the king, interpreted the royal will, and headed the judicial system. Chauvelin accepted the tapestry set around 1730, at the height of his career.
With their handsome galloping black and piebald stallions, an ancient Roman couple makes a dramatic return from a chariot race. Both a wreath of victory tucked in the man's belt and the winged figure of Victory holding a wreath on the side of the chariot suggest that the young people were triumphant.The balanced, elegantcompositionand static, posed figures typify theNeoclassicalstyle, which emphasized ancient noble subjects. The artist accentuated his technical skill by cleverly contrasting the cloud of dust from the horses' hooves with their well-combed but windblown tails and the molded leaves of thepalmettemotifdecorating the chariot's lower front.Carle Vernet exhibited this drawing and itspendant,The Death of Hippolytus,at theSalonof 1800, where they received wide acclaim. Another artist then produced engravings after them, which were exhibited at the Salon of 1808. Two years later, Thodore Gricault painted a copy from the engraving after this drawing. The two drawings were lost to sight after they were auctioned in 1817 and only reappeared on the market in the early 1990s.
In a balancedcompositionthat controls the subject's violence, Carle Vernet captured the final dramatic moment of an ancient Greek tragedy. Within the scene's frozen motion, Hippolytos's dramatic yet rigid pose typifies theNeoclassicalstyle. Nevertheless the artist emphasized his technical skill by contrasting the varied soft textures of the frothy clouds of sea spray, the horses' swirling manes and tails, and the leopard skin tied around Hippolytos's waist.Hippolytos's stepmother Phaidra fell in love with him, but he rejected her affections. In revenge, she left a note accusing him of defiling her, and committed suicide. His enraged fatherTheseusbanished Hippolytos and begged the gods to destroy him. As a result, the sight of a sea monster frightened the horses pulling Hippolytos in his chariot. Hippolytos lost control, and the horses dragged the hero to his death. Carle Vernet exhibited this drawing and itspendant,The Return from the Race,at theSalonof 1800, where they received wide acclaim. So popular were the scenes that another artist then produced engravings after them, which were exhibited at the Salon of 1808. The two drawings were auctioned in 1817, and did not reappear on the market until in the early 1990s.
Once you are in position you must take as the subject of your drawing or painting what can be encompassed in one glance, without moving or turning your head. . . . You must copy it as exactly as possible, both in form and in color, and do not think you can do better by adding or subtracting.So wrote Claude-Joseph Vernet in a letter describing his ideas on landscape painting in 1765. In this drawing, produced outside as an exercise in sketching, Vernet followed his own advice. Focusing on the combination of sunlit rock, overgrown trees, and undergrowth that formed the entrance to the murky tunnel opening at the back, he concentrated on a factual representation of the scene, including the fine roadside tomb on the left. The small chink of light in the midst of the shadow marks the other end of the tunnel, giving a sense of its length and breadth.Known as theGrottoat Posilipo, this tunnel, cut by the Romans to link Naples with the town of Pozzuoli, was a famous tourist attraction in the 1700s. Visitors admired it both for the drama of its tall, dark, and narrow space and as a feat of Roman engineering.
One might say that he begins by creating a place, and that he keeps men, women, and children in store to populate it, just as one might settle a colony. Then he creates the weather for them, and a sky, a season, a fortune or misfortune, as his fancy strikes him.So wroteDenis Diderotabout Claude-Joseph Vernet in his 1765Salonreview. Vernet's popular views of harbors and ships led to frequent copying and imitation, especially by a group of French artists working in southern Italy who followed his lead in specializing in Mediterranean harbor scenes.In a manner characteristic of Vernet's followers, this painting's peaceful arrangement balances a delicate tree and massive building at the left with an open view on the right. Human architectural constructions frame the intermingled sea and sky. The artist enlivened the seascape with picturesque figure groupings, each engaged in a routine, yet often amusing, activity from daily life.
Claude-Joseph Vernet depicted a storm's aftermath: dark clouds above an angry sea, a shipwrecked boat and its anxious survivors, and listing ships in the distance. As the sea furiously beats against the shoreline, waves explode beyond the rocks in a froth of white. The motion of the waves, the distant rain shaft, the battered ship, and even the bodies of the fleeing castaways fill the scene with strong, opposing diagonal lines. The lighthouse standing solidly upright at the painting's center counters all of this activity.The strong colors of the shipwrecked survivors' clothing stand out against thepaletteof greens, grays, and browns in the turbulent sea. Clearing skies cast the survivors in an eerie glow; dark tones at the left and lower edges and in the waves themselves draw further attention to the bright figures.The scene as a whole suggests the powerful force of nature over man. Vernet's companion piece for this painting,A Calm at a Mediterranean Port,presents a sharply contrasting scene of a harbor in more placid weather.
In brilliant detail, Claude-Joseph Vernet captured the gorgeous weather and leisurely activities of a day by the sea. Fishermen clean the day's catch on a stone pier while several people chat nearby, one of them pointing toward the large ship in the bay. Meanwhile, a man sits and smokes his pipe, the tobacco glowing a bright red. A cumulus cloud, perhaps the remnant of a distant storm, towers to the left of the setting sun. Warm tones of yellow, orange and red predominate, suggesting a hazy sunset after a bright day.InA Calm,Vernet portrayed a completely peaceful scene in striking contrast to itspendant,A Storm on a Mediterranean Coast.Taken together, the two works show, on the one hand, nature's benevolence, and on the other, nature's fury.
Christ sits on a raised pedestal and gestures eloquently to his apostles seated below him. Paolo Veronese produced this preliminary sketch as he began to work out his first thoughts for the complex final composition of a painting. He left out the background, concentrating instead on the arrangement of the seated figures, positioned to illustrate different attitudes of listening and contemplation.Veronese swiftly sketched the figures, outlining only the basic forms and used parallel hatching to suggest areas of shadow, texture, and depth. He used a simple oval form bisected by two lines to suggest the head, eyes, and mouth of Christ and his disciples and did not even bother to draw in their clothing.
As he waits to be beheaded by the soldiers who surround him, Saint George kneels at the bottom center of the drawing. Two soldiers on horseback stand on each side to ensure that the saint does not escape. Looking up to the heavens, the saint watches the figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity intercede on his behalf with the Virgin and Child in the upper right corner. Saints Peter and Paul sit at the feet of Mary and the infant Jesus, attended by music-making angels.Paolo Veronese made this drawing as a preparatory study for an altarpiece in Verona from about 1566. Although the drawing is very loose, it established the basic compositional features of the painting as well as the arrangement and character of the individual figures. Veronese's masterful integration of pen and wash was characteristic of his mature style.
A handsome, headless suit of steel armor flexes its arms while dissolving into sketchy lines at the bottom of the torso. The artist repeated an arm on the right side of the sheet, adding more detail of the elbow covering. Drawing from memory instead of copying exactly all the intricate details of an original, he drew various details on one side only, such as the multiple rows of scrolling on the left shoulder and arm.Although these studies do not match any known figures of men in armor by Paolo Veronese, either as portraits or within larger compositions, scholars suspect that Veronese or an artist close to him worked on this sheet. As in known Veronese drawings, this armor is presented as if it contains a gesturing man rather than as a uninhabited still-life form. The diagonal line of white highlights across the shoulder and stomach also closely correspond to a Veronese portrait of a man in armor. The rather broad, suggestive modeling, with sharper, darker chalk lines for emphasis, resembles other drawings by Veronese. With few other works for comparison, scholars remain hesitant about a firm attribution.
Enthroned and elegantly dressed, Justina of Padua looks toward the heavens in the center of thecomposition, pleading for intercession. Justina was a Christianmartyrwho died under the persecutions of the Roman Emperor Maximian. Her tormentors surround her, on the verge of stabbing her to death, while child angels descend from heaven bearing her martyr's crown and palm.Paolo Veronese made this highly finishedmodelloin preparation for analtarpiecefor Saint Giustina in Padua, the church built in the fifth century on the site of the Justina's martyrdom. Veronese and his studio painted the altarpiece from 1574 to 1575, using the drawing as a guide. Its squaring--the light ruling of a grid in black chalk--allowed the design to be transferred to the surface of the altarpiece prior to painting. Veronese used varying amounts of whitebodycolorthroughout, from the thickly painted, brilliant white light of the heavens in the upper part of the drawing to the more thinly appliedhighlightsin the draperies of the figures below.
The identity of this man is a mystery. Originally, scholars thought the painting was a self-portrait by Paolo Veronese, but no one can confirm this speculation since Veronese's appearance is otherwise completely unknown. Best known for his large decorativefrescocycles, Veronese did not paint many portraits. For him to have taken the time to paint this large, impressive portrait points to the commission's importance.The man leans on the base of a structure with fluted columns. In a niche between the columns is a marble sculpture of a draped female figure, of which only the lower portion is visible. Carvedreliefs, barely discernible, adorn the sides of the architectural base. These clues may refer to the subject's profession, perhaps that of a sculptor or architect. In the background at the lower left is the Venetian basilica of San Marco, placed in an imaginary rural setting. Most likely, the inclusion of San Marco alludes to the sitter's association with the church or the Venetian state.
In a difficult, graceful pose,Christleans his upper body forward, his arms extended so that one reaches towards the viewer and the other touches Saint John the Baptist's side. His head is bowed and his torso is muscular and sculpturally modeled. Standing on the shore of the Jordan River, Saint John leans back slightly as he pours water onto Christ's head. Above, divine light from theHoly Spiritin the form of a dove illuminates Christ. Below, three angels in various poses witness the act.Paolo Veronese used rich, luminous color and vibrant light to animate the scene. In the lush landscape, trees frame thecompositionand lean away to either side to reveal the open area in the middle. Saturated pinks, greens, and other high-pitched colors enrich the natural world surrounding the holy figures. Behind, the sky is broken into areas of color: blue near the horizon, pink in the center, and gray-green near the top.
After curing Tobit's blindness, returning the family's wealth, and making it possible for Tobit's son Tobias to marry his beloved Sarah, the Archangel Raphael has dropped his disguise and revealed himself as an angel, saying,  I was not acting on my own will, but by the will of God.  Such a scene of miraculous intervention was especially attractive to Protestants in Holland, who believed in doctrines of faith, mercy, and divine grace.Jan Victors took his subject from the Book of Tobit, among the Apocrypha in the Old Testament. Borrowing elements from his teacher Rembrandt van Rijn's 1637 rendition of the subject, Victors set his figures before and within an architectural setting and opened the composition to a clouded landscape on one side. Strong contrasts of light and dark and a foreshortened angel, flying away on a diagonal and viewed from the back, give the scene animation and urgency. Victors' characteristically careful interpretation of surface details includes beautifully rendered highlights on the costumes and Tobias's head.
This diminutiveprayer book, measuring about five by three and one-half inches, engages the viewer in intimate contemplation of both its text and its images. The book contains Latin prayers devoted toChrist, the Virgin, and the saints and is remarkably embellished with thirty-seven largeminiatures, several smaller miniatures, and decorations on every page. The largest miniatures measure only about three inches on the longest side, but they are incredibly detailed, often with deep panoramic landscapes framed by lush borders.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and son of bibliophilePhilip the Good, saw many of his father's unfinished book commissions through to completion; this prayer book is one of the rare commissions Charles initiated himself. The accounts of the Burgundian dukes record payments in 1469 to the scribe Nicholas Spierinc of Ghent, to theilluminatorLieven van Lathem of Antwerp, and to the goldsmith who made the original clasps for the binding of this costly book. Along with Lathem, several anonymous illuminators collaborated on this project, including the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy. In the 1480s, a series of additional prayers with miniatures by a French illuminator was added to the volume.
On an oval panel, a young woman poses in front of a landscape. Smiling slightly, she looks candidly out at the viewer.The sitter, Victoire-Pauline de Riquet de Carama, was an aristocrat and her status improved when she married Jean-Louis, Vicomte de Vaudreuil in 1781. The artist Elisabeth Louise Vige Le Brun emphasized the Vicomtesse's status and refinement by carefully describing her fashionable straw hat, silk dress, and gauze scarf, collar, and cuffs. Displaying her learning, the Vicomtesse places her right thumb in her book to mark her place, as if she has been interrupted while reading. Vige Le Brun adopted this obvious gesture, often used in men's portraits, to illustrate women's importance in French Enlightenment circles.
A pair of large eyes frames busts of the hero Herakles and his patron goddess Athena on one side of this black-figure cup. In the 500s B.C., Greek vase-painters frequently placed eyes on vessels, perhaps because they were believed to be apotropaic--that is, they had the power to ward off evil. The other side of the cup has a similar scene with three busts, one male and two female. The center female was once painted white and wears a type of headdress called apolos, typical of Greek goddesses. These busts, however, are harder to identify than those on the front of the cup. Some scholars identify them as Zeus, Hebe, and Hera, suggesting that the subject of the cup as a whole would be the apotheosis of Herakles, his introduction on Mount Olympus as a god. Other scholars, however, interpret the heads as Hades, Persephone, and Demeter and the cup's theme as Herakles' introduction into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult that promised a better afterlife to its followers.
This bowl, called ancuelle, originally held a light meat broth known asbouillon, which was drunk between meals. Specific features of both the form and decoration of these vessels allow scholars to date them precisely. The dark blue ground, known asbleu lapis, was not developed until 1752. The factory mark of the crossed L's, which is painted on the bottom of the dish, does not include adate letter, implying that the bowl was made before the introduction of the first date letter in 1753. These two pieces of information pinpoint the creation period within those two years.The fantastic birds, set in elaborately gilded asymmetrical cartouches, are typical of theRococostyle.
Designed to hold cut flowers orporcelainflowers mounted on naturalistically painted metal stems, this vase form was introduced at the Vincennes Porcelain Manufactory in 1754. It would probably have been set in front of a mirror, so that the elaborately painted scene on the back could also be admired. At the time the vase was produced, the vivid turquoise ground color, developed with aquamarinepigmentimported from Venice, was a recent invention and much admired.The elaborategildingthat frames the bird scenes and marks the edges of the vase is also notable for the skill it required. Gilding had to be applied at least twice over this ground color, as the turquoise-blue color tended to absorb the gold during firing because of its high copper content.
The form andgiltbands on this small watering can, decorated with sprays of flowers and gilding, imitate contemporary ones made of metal. The VincennesPorcelainManufactory made two sizes of watering cans beginning in 1753. This is the smaller size, only five examples of which are known today. It was probably used indoors for watering plants.
Delicate scents of potpourri once escaped from the holes pierced in the lids and shoulders of these vases. Made from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer, containers for potpourri and recipes for their sweet-smelling contents first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon prevalent. Fashionable women experimented with flowers and perfumes to achieve the finest fragrances, which were sometimes left to mature for up to nine years.Jean-Claude Duplessis, the artistic director of the Vincennes Manufactory probably designed the vases, which were namedpots-pourri Pompadourin honor ofMadame de Pompadour. In 1745 she becameLouis XV'smistress and a greatpatronof the factory.The dark blue ground color, invented only three years before this pair was made in 1752, was notoriously difficult to fire. Though not admired in its day, its uneven, textured appearance is greatly favored today. The painter, Jean-Louis Morin, based theputtiscenes on designs by Franois Boucher.
From the 1750s onwards, the SvresPorcelainManufactory supplied variousmarchands-mercierswith porcelain plaques that were then incorporated into various forms of furniture and other items. Dealers ordered the plaques directly from Svres and then passed them over tobnisteslike Adam Weisweiler with specific orders about the object they should ornament. Themarchandscould therefore offer their clients considerable choice over the final design. In 1785 Weisweiler became the main supplier of furniture mounted with Svres plaques to the dealer Dominique Daguerre.On this work, the porcelain plaques were probably produced before the final position and form of the secrtaire had been determined. The two oval plaques on each side are painted to be viewed horizontally, but they are mounted vertically, with their groups of musical instruments tilted awkwardly on their sides. This orientation suggests that they were not originally intended to be mounted on the same piece of furniture as the three rectangular plaques set on the front.
David Vinckboons filled this carefully constructed scene of a peasant festival orkermiswith many subtle details. In the front, a couple and two children cross a footbridge to join the celebration, meeting another group as they depart. A line of wildly dancing laborers that snakes through the center of the drawing then leads the viewer's eye farther back. Small clusters of revelers fill the rest of the scene. Many toast the dancers, consuming their wine or beer straight from the barrel or from jugs. Vinckboons drew the landscape, figures, and buildings with a fine pen and brown ink while using darker areas of gray wash to add volume and depth to the buildings and water in the foreground. But the villagers interested Vinckboons more than the landscape. Their scurrying forms are the focus, while the dilapidated buildings and trees simply form a backdrop to their activities.
Each of the four sides of this cabinet opens to reveal an unexpectedly complex series of drawers. Collectors from the early 1600s would have used cabinets of this kind to store such rare and exotic objects as medals, gems, or shells.The cabinet, however, was conceived as a work of art in its own right. Various masters would have executed the cabinet's diverse decoration, although only one can be named: the Dutch carver Albert Jansz. Vickenbrinck signed several of the fruitwoodreliefson one side with his monogram,ALVB.Each drawer is richly embellished in a variety of techniques and materials showing biblical,allegorical, historical, and mythological subjects. These include the symbols of the Passion,JudithandHolofernes, the contest ofApolloandMarsyas, the deaths ofCleopatraand Lucretia, and two Renaissance-style portraitmedallions. The number of subjects in which women figure prominently may have served a cautionary or moralizing function, while the religious themes express a concern for Christian virtue.
In the publicationBill Viola: The Passions,the artist describes the plot of his videoEmergence:Two women are seen sitting on either side of a marble cistern in a small courtyard. They wait patiently in silence, only occasionally acknowledging each other's presence. Time becomes suspended and indeterminate, the purpose and destination of their actions unknown. Their vigil is suddenly interrupted by a premonition. The younger woman abruptly turns and stares at the cistern. She watches in disbelief as a young man's head appears, and then his body rises up, spilling water over the sides and out onto the base and the courtyard floor.The cascading water catches the older woman's attention, and she turns to witness the miraculous event. She stands up, drawn by the young man's rising presence. The younger woman grasps his arm and caresses it as if greeting a lost lover. When the young man's pale body reaches its fullest extension, he totters and falls. The older woman catches him in her arms, and with the help of the younger woman, they struggle to lower him gently to the ground. Lying prone and lifeless, he is covered by a cloth. Cradling his head on her knees, the older woman finally breaks down in tears as the younger woman, overcome with emotion, tenderly embraces his body.As a work of art,Emergencetranscends this--and probablyany--literal description. The video resembles a painting because it is framed, mounted into a wall, silent, and the narrative occurs in extremely slow motion. As a rear-projection installation, it assumes an otherworldly glow. Although the plot suggests biblical stories such as Christ's Resurrection, such metaphorical associations are ambiguous: For example, the man rising out of a fountain of water implies birth, but his body, when laid out on the ground, suggests death.It is the viewer's participation almost as a bystander to a miraculous event, however, that makes the work mesmerizing. During the nearly twelve-minute video, the observer experiences the same extended passage of time as the women waiting by the well. This deliberate slowing down of sensual input encourages a heightened awareness of the characters' every nuanced expression and movement--and in turn, of the viewer's own perceptive process.Emergencewas commissioned by the Getty Museum as part of theBill Viola: The Passionsexhibition organized by the Museum in 2003. The video was inspired by a fresco from the 1400s by Masolino da Panicale, in which the dead Christ is shown at the moment of Resurrection.
Thismanuscriptbegins with a text by the astronomer Alchandreus, a somewhat mysterious figure who was active sometime before the 900s. He wrote on such topics as the movement of the planets, the signs of the zodiac, and the art of predicting the future. Alchandreus consulted Arabic sources for his writings, and also citedAlexander the Greatas an authority on various subjects. The second part of this manuscript contains Boethius's (480-525) texts on mathematics and music, of which few manuscript copies survive. All the texts appear in Latin, the scholastic language of the Middle Ages (the title in Latin isLiber Alchandrei philosophi).Threeminiaturespainted by theVirgilMaster appear in this manuscript, along with numerous charts and diagrams that illustrate points in the text. Although members of the European courts often commissioned scientific treatises, high-qualityilluminatedcopies like this example are rare. Like otherInternational styleartists, the Virgil Master incorporated many elements of courtly life into his miniatures, such as elaborate costume and structures modeled after castle architecture. The artist worked at the court ofJean, duc de Berry, and this manuscript was most likely commissioned by one of the duke's high-ranking officials.
The philosopher Alchandreus kneels at the center of this image and presents his text to a king seated on an elaborate throne in a lavish reception hall. Alchandreus's subdued green robe contrasts with the vibrant blues and reds of the surrounding courtiers' luxurious costumes. In his book, Alchandreus citesAlexander the Greatas an authority, so this scene may represent his dedication of the text to the king. The delicate ivy-leaf pattern that fills the border of this page is common in Frenchmanuscriptilluminationof the 1300s and 1400s.
Boethius leans forward in his imposing chair to instruct the young boy who sits on a stool at his feet. The student extends his wax tablets, which display a series of numbers. The wax tablets were constructed of wooden boards, covered with wax. Students could write and then reuse the surface by covering it with new wax. The background of the scene is filled with a glittering checkerboard design called a diapered ground, which was used frequently in French illumination in the early 1400s. This image marks the transition in the manuscript between the end of Alchandreus's text and the beginning of Boethius'sArithmetica,a discussion of mathematics.
In this miniature, which introduces Boethius's text on music, the philosopher sits on a large wooden throne on the right instructing four bearded men about music. The circular gold diagram that seems to hover at the center of the scene displays tonal intervals. The lesson takes place in a grassy field where Boethius's four students sit on rocks; however, the background is filled with an intricate gold pattern set on a rich red surface.
This woman's identity is unknown, but her elegant dress and jewelry identify her as a member of the well-to-do burgher class. Though her pose is rigid and formal, her outward gaze and slightly pursed lips enliven her presence. Prominent on her right hand is a ring; she is perhaps recently married, but rings in Holland during the 1600s also served as tokens of affection.On the right side of the sheet, the elaborately flourished signature of Cornelis Visscher dominates. Using fine, hatched lines, Visscher captured the subtle creases and folds of the sitter's outfit; by contrast, he used the blank page to define her tasseled white collar. Like most of his important portrait commissions, this large drawing is on expensive vellum and was executed in black chalk. Most likely created as an independent work, the drawing could be hung on the wall, framed.
Although the Venetians tried to protect their glass monopoly, issuing orders and threatening terrible punishments to workers who emigrated to the North, manufacturing ofcristalloand other types offaon de Veniseglass spread to many parts of Europe in the 1500s. In 1534 in Hall, Austria, Wolfgang Vitl founded one of the earliest northern Europeanglasshousesto produce Venetian-style products, employing both Venetian glassblowers and local craftsmen. To protect his investment, Vitl succeeded in gaining fromEmperor Ferdinand Ithe sole right to produce colorless glass (referred to as  white  glass) for fifteen to twenty years. Documents relating to this glasshouse indicate that Vitl aimed to provide quality vessels that would be less expensive for the Austrian and German upper classes than importing Venetian glass.Molds were brought from Murano to northern glasshouses, allowing Vitl and glassblowers elsewhere to produce identical forms. Known as an umbo vase because of the pattern of umbones or bulges around the body, this vase was patterned on those produced in Murano. The arms in cold-paint andgildingare those of a patrician family from Nuremberg.
This unusually shaped vessel copies the form of amaiolicadrug jar. It was probably originally part of a larger service of similar or identical vessels, since a matching vessel is today in a London private collection. The arms on the front are those of three brothers who each became thebishopof Freising, Germany, in the first half of the 1500s. On the reverse side, the Agnus Deiemblemrefers to the bishop's responsibilities.
Mercury, god of science, commerce, and travel in Greek and Roman mythology, was messenger to the god Jupiter. Identified by his winged helmet, he originally held acaduceus, which is now broken. His raised left foot rests on the head of the monster Argus, whom Mercury killed to free one ofJupiter'slovers. The young god's lithe, elongated body and the pronounced shift of his body weight from one leg to the other are characteristic features of theManneriststyle.The figure's downward glance suggests that the original work was meant to be executed on a larger scale and to be seen from below. Alessandro Vittoria probably designed this freestanding figure and a bronzeMinervaaspendants, both of which he signed.The drapery support behind the figure suggests that the bronze is a copy of a work originally carved in marble and then reproduced in metal. In marble statues a support bears the weight of the piece, but it has no function in bronze statues. The bronze bears little evidence of work after the casting. All the details were worked out in the wax core, attesting to the high quality of the casting technique.
Bartolomeo Vivarini's paintings were noted for their use of bright, dissonant colors and figures that resemble sculptures or wood carvings. This polyptych, made for a parish church dedicated to Saint James the Greater in northern Italy, depicts Saint James in the center, holding a pilgrim's staff with the symbolic scallop shell and a book.At the lower left, Saint John the Baptist wears his customary tunic of animal skins and a pale gray-green mantle and stands in a rocky setting along the river Jordan, unlike the other figures who stand before a marble ledge. To his left stands Saint John the Evangelist.At the lower right, Saint Bartholomew holds a book and a knife, the symbol of his martyrdom, and an elderly Saint Peter holds the keys to the kingdom of heaven.In the central panel of the upper tier, the Virgin holds the Christ Child, who raises his right arm in blessing. At the top left, Saint Catherine of Alexandria holds a broken wheel, her symbol of martyrdom, and Saint Ursula clasps two rods with banners. On the Virgin's left, Saint Apollonia holds a book and a pincer with a tooth, referring to the instruments of her martyrdom, and Saint Lucy holds an oil lamp that alludes to the significance of her name, saint of light.
This distinguished gentleman does not address the viewer, but gazes out fixedly at a point beyond the frame. The slight turn of head, the pursed lips, and the left hand at his jacket convey a sense of ease, comfort, and confidence. The sitter's dress reinforces his assuredness. The cascading curls of his abundant powdered wig fall below his shoulders. The wig's downward flow is echoed in the turquoise ribbon punctuating his white shirt. The bright blue of the ribbon, as well as the crisp white lace cuff, enliven the mutedpaletteof grays and greens. The simple backdrop, free of furniture or other exterior trappings, ensures that the viewer focuses on the life-size portrait.For many years, this gentleman was believed to be Samuel Bernard, one of the wealthiestfinanciersin Paris. But comparisons to documented portraits of Bernard suggest that thepasteldepicts another sitter, one who has yet to be identified. Given that Joseph Vivien was among France's most sought-after pastel portraitists and commanded high prices for his work, the sitter would certainly have been of significant wealth.
Using two joined sheets of paper, Simon de Vlieger created a panoramic landscape of expansive space, contrasting textures, and varied rhythms. De Vlieger captured the land's erosion in striking, lyrical curves that take up nearly half thecompositionand provide an almost abstract pattern and visual rhythm. Above the land rise the soft, feathery trees whose texture contrasts with the earth's smoothness. Their strong, stable vertical thrust helps to balance the winding waves below. De Vlieger also balanced the left and right sides of the drawing, juxtaposing the trees' great height and the mound on which they stand with the wide vista of the town beyond.The field sloping down to the left around which a wooded road curves, the stretch of earth eroded into wavelike mounds, and the snaking river in the distance also appear in de Vlieger'sWooded Landscape with Sleeping Peasants: Parable of the Sowerin the Cleveland Museum of Art.
The Chantilly porcelain manufactory, established about 1725 by thePrince de Cond, made this ornate clock case ofsoft-paste porcelain. The prince owned a large collection of Japanese porcelain, which the factory used as models for its earliest productions. By the time this unique clock was made, the factory had developed its own whimsical interpretations of Asianmotifs, combining an exotic dragon and monkey with European flowers.Clock movements such as this one, designed for the alcoves of bedchambers(pendules d'alcove),were fitted with a cord that struck the nearest hour and a quarter when pulled. This mechanism eliminated the need to light a candle to tell the time.
Pierre-Jacques Volaire's sensitivity to detail enriches this study of a  modern  villa built on the site of ancient Roman ruins. Volaire's scene recalls thefte galante,a fanciful vision of well-dressed men and women enjoying themselves in the open air popularized by Antoine Watteau earlier in the century. Volaire's fluent execution and lyricism fit his subject'sromantic, light-hearted subject. The groups of figures are differentiated by subtle variations, from silhouetting the figures in the boat on the left to illuminating the fishmongers and their customers in the center.By the time he painted this picture, Volaire, who settled in Naples in 1769, had become a one-man assembly line for paintings of MountVesuviusin moonlight. These theatrical works exemplified the eighteenth century's fascination with the sublime: a noble and lofty feeling of awe inspired by natural phenomena.
Volterrano depicts the priest and notorious prankster Arlotto Mainardi (1396-1488) performing a trick on his companions. They gather around a rustic table under a shady portico, with a sunlit villa in the background. Having been sent to the cellar to draw wine for the meal, Arlotto, anticipating that his share of food would be consumed while he is gone, leaves the barrel spigot open so that wine continues to gush to the floor. On his return, the prankster's upraised fist and playfully severe facial expression elicit varied reactions from the men at the table. Elaborately worked and squared so that it could be copied on to a canvas, the drawing served as amodellofor one of Volterrano's most famous paintings, now in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence. The artist's contemporaries so admired the composition that they made numerous copies of it; however, the apparent humor in the scene may be lost on present-day viewers.
In this figure study, a lightly sketched female personification of Truth removes a veil from the eyes of an allegorical figure. Holding symbols of earthly greed-a scepter and crown-the reclining figure represents intellectual and spiritual Blindness.Volterrano showed his great command of the red chalk technique with the figure of Blindness, shaped by soft, richly applied strokes. With sensitivity and economy, he added luminous highlights of white lead. To develop the boundaries of her body and define her relationship to other elements, Volterrano relied on more than contour. For instance, he used the paper, touches of lead white, and the chalk shading that defines the cushions to create the form of her left arm.Volterrano made this drawing for a fresco in a palazzo in Florence. In the fresco, Truth holds a book in her upraised left hand, and additional symbols of earthly greed, including two sacks of money, surround the jeweled figure of Blindness.
In preparation for a ceilingfrescoof the Assumption commissioned by aMediciprince for a church in Florence, Volterrano made many compositional drawings. This study for the fresco, one of the most complete, includes all the principal elements of the painting, with only a few figures posed somewhat differently. The expansive illusionism of the scene and the figures' freedom of movement reflect Volterrano's awareness and understanding of the exuberant, illusionistic High Baroque style of Pietro da Cortona.A great physical achievement, the commission forced the aging artist to work on scaffolding at dizzying heights and in an uncomfortable and badly lit environment.
From this low point of view, this nude female figure draped with a cloth appears large and strong. She seems to be considering something in front of her, tilting her head sideways as she reaches out and steps forward. Theputtowho clings to her leg for protection also gazes off to the left. Simon Vouet experimented with the position of her outstretched arm, first drawing it in at a higher level before partially erasing it and starting again.Vouet applied black chalk in long grace strokes, describing the gentle curves of the woman's arms and body with strong outlines and subtle shading. The shading enhances the impression of mass and solidity. Dark shadows that extend backwards from the feet of both figures also contribute to the illusion of weight and mass.In the male nude onverso, Vouet drew a similarly monumental figure seen from slightly below and readjusted the position of the figure's right arm. He used the empty space between the man's legs to draw the feet, which he was unable to fit at the end of the legs.
Known both as an astute politician and a connoisseur of the French arts, Cardinal de Richelieu controlled much of France's political and artistic sphere in the 1600s. Simon Vouet drew him in his cardinal's robes while clasping in his hands a letter, an attribute of his life as an official of the Church and the State. Richelieu's direct, incisive gaze holds the viewer's eyes and attention.King Louis XIII commissioned Vouet to produce a series of some thirty portrait drawings of noblemen, artists, and officers of the court in colored chalks on light brown paper. In this highly finished example, Vouet used a combination of red, black, and white chalk. The red chalk shows off the brilliant color of the cardinal's cape and hat, while the white creates soft highlights in his hair and collar. Black chalk lines behind the cardinal give the figure added weight and depth. Finally, layers of pastel on top of the chalk give the surface of the drawing added richness and texture.
Venus, the goddess of love, and her loverAdonismeet each other's eyes, their bodies still half entwined. Holding his spear, the young mortal Adonis sits upright, anxious to be off to the hunt while his dog waits patiently at his side. Venus touches his shoulder, imploring him not to go. In so doing, she reclines slightly backwards as if to pull him closer. To her left a pair of doves,Venus'sattribute, symbolize love and constancy.Paintings like this one were popular with sophisticated artpatronsin Paris, where Simon Vouet returned in 1627 after spending years in Rome. He absorbed the lessons of ItalianBaroquepainting and continued to use bright, decorative colors; Adonis wears a yellow-gold robe over a fuchsia-colored tunic and lavender sandals, and Venus is partially clad in a white undergarment and a subdued violet-blue robe. Her creamy white skin contrasts with the darker, smooth skin of Adonis, here depicted as an adolescent with rosy cheeks and a bud-like mouth.
Intended as a grave gift, this Athenian white-ground lekythos depicts family members preparing to visit a loved one's grave. The woman holds a basket filled with standard funerary offerings: ribbons, wreaths, andaryballoi, a type of small oil vessel. The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.
With an approach completely different from that of his contemporaries, Jacobus Vrel captured the feeling of everyday life on a town street where tall buildings with shops and markets crowd out the sky and people have time to chat amidst the bricks and cobblestones.Never trained in the popular manner, Vrel did not useperspectiveand he never primed his canvases. His figures do not cast shadows. Yet his primitive, independent style imparts a naive intimacy and truth to the moments he chose for his panels. His humble approach, imbued with sincerity and compassion for the average person, shows sensitivity toward the quiet moments that make up the bulk of most people's lives.This picture was once owned by Thophile Thor-Brger, who rediscovered Johannes Vermeer in the 1800s and believed that this panel was by Vermeer himself.
This lavishbook of hourscontains over eightyminiatures, and the texts included in the book indicate that the wealthypatronwas almost certainly English. The stiff figures and unusually intense colors identify the artist as Willem Vrelant, who was an active member of the artisans'guildin Bruges. He led one of the top illuminator's workshops in Bruges during the third quarter of the 1400s. At that time, Bruges was one of the leading European centers for production ofilluminated manuscripts, especially books of hours. The person who commissioned this book may have been a member of the large community of foreign merchants living in Bruges or was perhaps a patron who lived in England.
Christ stands on the banks of a river holding an orb, which indicates his role in this image asSavior of the World(Salvator Mundi). A dove, a common symbol of the Holy Spirit, hovers in front of Christ. Below the dove, a passage from Genesis is inscribed in gold:Spiritus dei ferebat(ur) super aquas(The spirit of God moved over the water). The appearance of Christ as Savior of the World, the presence of the dove, and the text from Genesis imply that the existence of the Trinity and the promise of salvation were inherent from the beginning of the world. The image appropriately accompanies the beginning of the Hours of the Holy Spirit. In this manuscript, a large illumination prefaces each of the eight sets of prayers, indicating that the patron had a special reverence for the Holy Spirit.
Thomas Becket (about 1118-1170), chancellor of England andArchbishopof Canterbury, devoutly prays before the altar in CanterburyCathedralwhile three knights approach him from behind, one with his sword raised menacingly. Becket had been a trusted friend of Henry II, King of England, but they became entangled in a quarrel over the rights of the Church. That dispute ended bitterly in 1170 when a group of Henry's knights, incited by their king's anger at the archbishop, killed Becket at the altar of Canterbury Cathedral. Becket was officially proclaimed a saint within three years, and was heralded as a hero who had defied a tyrant for the Church. He remained one of the most popular English saints untilHenry VIII, during theProtestantReformation, desecrated his shrine, destroyed his bones, and ordered that all mention of his name be obliterated. The erasures on the page below thisilluminationwere almost certainly a result of Henry's decree. They indicate that the book was in England after 1532, when Henry VIII broke with Rome.
Judasleans in from behind to kissChrist, a signal that reveals Jesus' identity to the soldiers, who then seize Christ. The brightly colored clothing and swift movements of the soldiers contrast with the somber attire and stationary figure of Christ himself, who projects a passive mood of calm acceptance. The image is the first in a series of depictions of thePassion of Christthat accompanies a sequence of prayers devoted to the same subject.
Mary andJosephalong with four angels gather around the tiny babyChrist, who lies on a portion of the Virgin's robe. Details such as the presence of angels and Christ lying on the ground with rays of light shining from his body come from Saint Bridget's popular account of her vision of theNativityfrom the 1300s. Saint Bridget further recounted that the light surrounding the baby completely outshone the candle Joseph had brought, as depicted in the image. From above, God and the dove of theHoly Spiritbless the event. A peaceful landscape featuring castles and delicate swans in the distance completes the scene.The Nativityaccompanies the prayers forPrimeof theHours of the Virgin.
The original owner of thismanuscriptand his family kneel before an altar in adoration of the Eucharist, shown in an elaborate gold monstrance. The image introduces a short service called the Office of the Holy Sacrament. Although thepatronsof the book have not been identified, the richness of their fashionable attire and the costliness of the decorated book itself indicate that the couple was well-to-do. The patrons' presence in the image suggests that they felt a particular veneration for the Eucharist. The consecrated bread is thus shown here not in the context of an officialMassservice but on the altar of a small family chapel. Although clearly divided by gender on either side of the altar, the couple and other household members are unified in their adoration of the Eucharist.
The black-robed figures that surround the draped coffin in thisminiatureare probably professional mourners, hired for the funeral. The crippled beggar on crutches approaching on the right was probably also hired for the occasion. The poor were considered especially good intercessors on behalf of the souls of the dead, so it became common during the later Middle Ages to arrange for the distribution of food and alms to the poor on the day of a funeral. On the left, fourmonksstand before an open choir book wearing elaborate copes, while a priest performs theMassfor the dead at the altar. The owner of thisprayer bookwas meant to reflect on this image and the accompanying Office of the Dead on a daily basis as a reminder of humanity's mortality and the need for penitence and charity to achieve salvation.
Against a drapedbackgroundwith a soft yet spiky shadow, Adam Clark Vroman artfully arranged three patterned baskets and an unidentifiable woven item on a table. His interest in documenting the Pueblo Indians clearly extended beyond making straightforward portraits to include the artifacts they created. In addition to photographing such objects, he displayed the baskets he had collected from various Pueblo tribes in his Pasadena apartment, along his with numerous Navaho weavings.Vroman regarded his Native American subjects with a congenial and respectful attitude, writing in a 1901 periodical,  The Indian is a sympathetic fellow, appreciates kindness, and never forgets a friend.  Differing from many of his contemporaries, he further declared that  I have no liking for the man who...says that all good Indians are dead Indians. 
The Mr. Hooker of the title was the elected head of the Hopi village of Sichimovi in Arizona, a frequent setting for Adam Clark Vroman's portraits andgenrestudies.  This interior view shows a woman seated in the upstairs sleeping quarters, peering out at the visitor with a camera. Among the objects in the living area below are traditional Hopi kachina dolls as well as aVictorianumbrella. The photographs tacked to the wall appear to be of a village and may be Vroman's work, possibly indicating a relationship between Vroman and this household.The early twentieth century found many amateur photographers documenting Native cultures in the Southwest. The romantic image of a place where few non-Indians had previously ventured was fostered in the popular imagination through widely circulated newspaper accounts, novels, and stories. Vroman was one of the few photographers of the region who established a friendly relationship with his subjects beyond that of a curious tourist.
At a four-for-a-quarter Photomat in a pinball arcade at 52nd and Broadway, Andy Warhol instructed art collector Ethel Scull,  Now start smiling and talking, this is costing me money.  She proceeded, with and without her large round sunglasses, to look sultry and silly, exhilarated and somber, until the machine had generated more than twenty-four strips, each with four frames of finished photographs.Warhol's 1963 multipanel portrayal of Scull,Ethel Scull Thirty-six Times,is among the best known of his early Pop portraits. The grid of thirty-six silkscreen-on-canvas panels, each 20 x 16 inches, was one of his first commissioned portraits and the second painted portrait based on the photobooth images.Ethel Scull and her husband Robert became identified with Pop Art through their patronage of and generous hospitality toward the artists of  the latest thing.  They were newly rich and, in the art world at least, suddenly famous, making Ethel an ideal subject for Warhol and a superstar in her own way. As she herself described the sixties,  My life had all the glamour and glitter of a Hollywood starlet's. 
Andy Warhol sent assistants to the Gilded Grape, a bar on Eighth Avenue and 45th Street, to recruit models for a series on drag queens eventually titled  Ladies and Gentlemen.  The men who responded were not told the artist's name and were paid fifty dollars per half-hour to pose for Warhol's Polaroid camera. More than ten drag queens responded, and Warhol produced painted portraits as well as screen prints from the sittings. This portrait of Helen Harry Morales was not one of the ten images used in the final portfolio; Warhol did, however, use it as an image screened in black chalk over muted shades of green, orange, and blue-gray acrylic on a small canvas.
At 4:00 the Walt Disney film crew came and shot me in front of my Shoes and my Walt Disney drawings. They asked me who my favorite Disney character was and I said, 'Minnie Mouse, because she can get me close to Mickey.'So wrote Andy Warhol in 1981. Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein had painted Mickey Mouse on a challenge from his young son to prove that he could  draw like the people who did cartoons,  but this made his friend Andy Warhol jealous. Lichtenstein had  gotten to Mickey first,  thus scooping Warhol on representing the popular cultural icon.Lichtenstein and Warhol collected each other's work. As part of a trade between the two artists, Warhol made this Polaroid study in preparation for painting his friend's portrait. He admired Lichtenstein's art, which employed a limited palette of flat primary colors and heavy black outlines in imitation of comic book illustrators and commercial printing methods.
In the late 1970s, Warhol painted portraits of Liza Minnelli based on his Polaroids. Minnelli, a Hollywood child who first appeared onscreen as a toddler, was an important part of Warhol's inner circle in the 1970s and 1980s. She had formidable show-business parents--singer-actress Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli--and achieved her own lead roles in stage productions only after performing with her mother and working as an apprentice on other musicals. In Minnelli Warhol found a powerfully iconic face with strong elements ready-made for the Polaroid. Her short black bangs, large dark eyes outlined with heavy makeup, and full lips painted a dark red stood out in the print even before they were transferred to silkscreen, which would simplify them even further. Warhol finally chose to paint from another print, rather than from this one. Perhaps he felt that the red-orange hooded dress gave the composition a somber, mourning quality unfit for the sitter's home. On the other hand, Warhol must have appreciated the simple lines and religious overtones of Minnelli's draped head and sad gaze. He portrayed her as an alluring celebrity while suggesting her private burdens.
In 1979 the Polaroid Corporation invited Andy Warhol to make portraits in its Cambridge, Massachusetts, studio, where the prototype of a new 20 x 24-inch camera that weighed eight hundred pounds and could produce color photographs in sixty seconds had been set up. The bulky apparatus could not easily be moved for compositional changes; it had to remain stationary while the subject was arranged. Then, when all was ready, Polaroid's technician was on hand to operate it. In spite of these restrictions, Warhol seems to have had fun making more than ten portraits--most of them self-portraits.Warhol made four extreme close-up self-portraits with the new camera in a single day, including this one. He seems to have quickly understood that he had to get very close to the enormous camera, to confront it almost, thus making a larger-than-life-size portrait that exploited the camera's unusual potential. He gazed upward and away from the lens, leaving the left side of his face in deep shadow. These elements emphasize and abstract the simple highlighted lines of his face.
Andy Warhol enjoyed dressing for parties in drag, sometimes in dresses of his own design. He admired  the boys who spend their lives trying to be complete girls,  so in 1981 he and a photographic assistant, Christopher Makos, agreed to collaborate on a session portraying Warhol in drag. In many ways, they modeled the series on Man Ray's 1920s work with the French artist Marcel Duchamp, in which the two artists created a female alter ego name Rrose Slavy for Duchamp.Warhol and Makos made a number of pictures, both black-and-white prints and color Polaroids, of their first attempt. For the second round of pictures, they hired a theater makeup person. This stage professional better understood the challenge of transforming a man's face into that of a woman. After the makeup, Warhol tried on curled, straight, long, short, dark, and blonde wigs. Here he appears in a conventionally masculine white shirt and plaid tie.
In Andy Warhol's depiction of his old friend Robert Rauschenberg as the wounded artist, the gauze and bandages add layers to the portrait in a way similar to Rauschenberg's own layered working methods. He and Warhol met in 1960 and two years later got together at Warhol's studio in a session that provided inspiration for both artists. Rauschenberg discovered the silkscreen process that Warhol was already using to transfer photographic images to canvas, and Warhol decided to do a series of paintings based on family snapshots of Rauschenberg, taking him as his first non-celebrity Pop subject. Through large canvases that repeated his portrait as many as twenty-five times, Warhol made Rauschenberg's face famous.A passion for photographs, including those they made themselves, was at the center of artmaking for both Warhol and Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg's confidence in photographs as major gallery pieces may have reassured Warhol that he should begin exhibiting some of the hundreds of photographs he had made in documenting his own life.
He's the kid who...used to sit on the sidewalk in Greenwich Village and paint T-shirts, and I'd give him $10 here and there...now he's on Easy Street. He's got a great loft on Christie Street. He was a middle-class Brooklyn kid--I mean, he went to college and things--and he was trying to be like that, painting in the Greenwich Village....I took a Polaroid and he went home and within two hours a painting was back, still wet of him and me together. And I mean, just getting to Christie Street must have taken an hour. He told me his assistant painted it.Thus Andy Warhol described his first impressions of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Warhol made this portrait in the fall of 1982, when he was first formally introduced to the newly famous twenty-one-year-old painter. Warhol was one of Basquiat's heroes; the young star, in turn, represented for Warhol the creative sexual energy of the 1960s. The two prolific artists carried on an intense friendship in the mid-eighties, culminating in an artistic collaboration. Basquiat died of a drug overdose before he was twenty-eight, fulfilling his belief that  the true path to creativity is to burn out. 
The early 1980s saw the emergence of artists, including Keith Haring, whose work originated in or was inspired by graffiti, the stylized words and pictures that rebellious adolescents were spray-painting on walls and other public surfaces in urban America. Andy Warhol made Haring's acquaintance in 1982.Haring attributed his simple graphic style, which Warhol praised as  cartoonist,  to the hallucinatory power of drugs. Warhol made his Polaroids of Haring, seen here on the left, and his partner Juan Dubose, in preparation for several forty by forty-inch painted portraits, one executed in black and white. The camera's flash and studio lighting created strong shadows that haunt the figures. Warhol helped his young friends deal with problems caused by their early success, but portraits such as this--heavy with memorial overtones--suggest that he was also prescient about their early deaths.
Inspired by Andy Warhol's filmChelsea Girls(1966), Robert Mapplethorpe moved to Manhattan in 1969 to meet the artist and to emulate him-in art, lifestyle, and material success. After he settled at the Chelsea Hotel, where segments of Warhol's film were shot, he began making photographs, often self-portraits or portraits of his roommate, the poet Patti Smith, and usually with a borrowed Polaroid camera.Mapplethorpe's maturing approach to photography resembled Warhol's in many ways. He had no patience for the technical side of the medium and prided himself on gaining a reputation without ever having made a print himself. Portraiture was his main theme, and he used the camera as a means of making connections with celebrities, potential patrons, and possible lovers. In the 1980s, sales of Mapplethorpe's pictures soared. Warhol was commissioned to paint his portrait, so Mapplethorpe sat for the preparatory Polaroids, including this one. In turn, Warhol sat for Mapplethorpe in 1986.
Princess Caroline, daughter of Hollywood star Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III of Monaco, was only twenty-six when Andy Warhol took this Polaroid. Her very fast life had been filled with yachts, discotheques, costly resorts, designer clothes, an early marriage to an older man, and a fairly swift divorce. As the oldest of the prince's three children, she had served as  first lady  of Monaco since her mother's tragic death in an automobile accident the previous fall. Andy Warhol portrayed her in the same aloof style that had been her mother's hallmark.Warhol considered royalty another element of the Pop scene. His representations of Princess Caroline, however, were more in the tradition of Hollywood studio photographers than that of court painters. Warhol posed Caroline in profile, as if he were photographing a legendary star, with her long, soft, wavy hair hanging loose on her bare neck. The lighting on her face cast a deep shadow, creating strong chiaroscuro in 1940s film noir style; along with her downward gaze, the lighting made her appear remote and imperious.
 [N]ow, it seems like you have to do lots of things really well, and you don't get to stay famous for long unless you're always switching. Grace Jones is an example of this,  wrote Andy Warhol. Indeed, Jones had been a runway model, singer, movie actress, and performance artist by the time she was thirty. She had also gained celebrity status for her individual style. Her six-foot height, striking features, dramatic makeup, and love of men's clothing created attention as well as confusion; was she a man in drag, a woman who had been a man, or the product of a plastic surgeon Voguemagazine commissioned Warhol to photograph Jones in July 1984. He waited three hours before an assistant discovered that Jones was at a department store retrieving one of her furs from storage. According to Warhol, who thought jewelry a much better investment, Jones spent  all her money on fur coats.  It is not surprising, then, that he portrayed her in one during this session.
Andy Warhol always took the role of playing himself quite seriously, employing a variety of wigs, eyeglasses (including, importantly, sunglasses), and makeup, as well as a subtly changing but always hip wardrobe to present the part of the famousavant-gardeartist. For some of his last painted self-portraits, Warhol selected his platinum  fright wig  and, after making a series of Polaroids, combined his own portrait with a silkscreen camouflage pattern on canvas, thereby disguising his own face rather than illuminating it. Warhol's pale face has an almost ghostly appearance, hovering in the midst of a solid black ground punctuated only by wild strands from his reflective wig.
Anthonie Waterloo covered nearly every inch of paper with ink and wash, leaving little of the sheet bare. He used dark, dense strokes applied with the tip of his brush tohighlighttheforegroundfoliage; in the middle distance he gradually lightened the lines; Waterloo described the distant mountain with delicate washes of gray.In Waterloo's vision of nature, humans are diminutive spectators: a pair of peasants in blue and red are dwarfed by the majestic pines behind them. The immense trees even overshadow the waterfall, which cascades through the center of the scene.Despite the detailed and finished character of the drawing, it does not represent a real location. Waterloo carried on the tradition of imaginary alpine views popularized by another Utrecht artist, Roelandt Savery.
Watkins was persistently interested in the technical details of mining operations. Here a primitive Spanish ore mill is used to pulverize gold-bearing rock. Throughout his career Watkins earned income producing photographs that were used as sources for engraved illustrations, as this one was.
Watkins could have made this study of the Lima Cathedral on his return to California from New York via South America in 1852.
In 1852 Watkins went to New York, then returned to California the following spring aboard the SSMichael Angelo, which was loaded with tons of supplies destined for mining camps on the Pacific Coast of the Americas. The vessel proceeded to the port of Caldera, Chile, where goods destined for the mines at Copiap were unloaded. Miners and their various forms of shelter, such as the tent shown here in the landscape, were among Watkins's favorite subjects.
In the winter of 1852 Watkins went to New York via Panama to secure merchandise for Huntington, Hammond and Company. He returned with an entire shipload of goods aboard the SSMichael Angelo,which traveled around Cape Horn, stopping in Chile, Peru, Panama, and Mexico--a journey that took almost six months. Watkins could have made this daguerreotype in May or June of 1852.
The mining camp of La Rancherie was located near the fabled Sutter's Mill in California, where gold was discovered in 1849. In the volatile gold-rush environment of prospectors, get-rich-quick dreams, and fly-by-night towns, an assembly of men in the foreground stood for the camera to immortalize their roles in the historical moment. La Rancherie stood out for its stability: it could boast a few buildings made of clapboard and some that were even painted. The illustrated hotel sign at upper left indicates a clientele that was not entirely literate and might rely on pictures to identify potential lodgings.
In his 1856San Francisco Album, publisher George R. Fardon included six photographs that form an incomplete panorama of the city. Fardon positioned the plates randomly in his book rather than in topographical order. A missing plate completes the view. The seven-part version was printed before Fardon compiled his album, perhaps before the glass negative for the absent plate was broken or lost. This suggests that Fardon did not create the negatives himself, but acquired them later, apparently not knowing they formed a panorama.
The built environment within the landscape was of great interest to Watkins.
Benton Works mill (and dam) was in the vast Las Mariposas mining estate controlled by John C. Frmont and his wife, Jessie Benton Frmont. Watkins's commission drew upon his prior experience with mother lode mining subjects.
Against the soft, organic edges of the Las Mariposas hills, a human-made road carved out for the rail route appears like a sharply engraved line. Carleton Watkins photographed many images of Las Mariposas, the mineral-rich estate of John C. Frmont, former Republican presidential candidate and United States senator. As the owners of a gold mine, the Frmonts--with whom Watkins maintained a close relationship--were among the wealthiest and most influential people in California. On the way to and from the Frmonts' gold mine, Watkins made at least six exposures. This study, surely made on his return late in the day, benefits from the afternoon sun.
In 1860 Carleton Watkins made his first sustained sequence of landscape views, forty-eight mammoth-plate photographs of the Las Mariposas estate. Located less than forty miles from Yosemite, Las Mariposas featured a landscape of little topographical interest--but beneath the surface of this 40,000-acre estate lay the southern end of California's Mother Lode, the world's richest gold vein. John C. Frmont, who owned the land, and his associates used Watkins's images of mills, dams, and roads at the Las Mariposas estate when trying to raise funds for mining from investors.A wagon road and a parallel railroad rising two thousand vertical feet from the Merced River led to the economic heart of the Las Mariposas property, the Pine Tree and Josephine Mines. In this view looking north from Mount Josephine, the railroad tracks and the line traced by the river nearly meet near the picture's center, neatly bisecting the rocky terrain.
This image reveals Carleton Watkins's skill for choosing the right spot to place his camera. Taking the picture on a winter day with the bright sun low in the sky allowed him to expose the image in a short time--possibly a twenty-fifth of a second. The speed captured only one individual moving his head and leg, on the far left; the five men on and inside the stagecoach and all but one of the twelve men standing nearby remained perfectly still for the brief period of the exposure. Watkins made the photograph to document John C. Frmont's departure from Bear Valley for Europe. Frmont is the second man from the right, on top of the stagecoach.
Watkins often explored the ways in which lumber was used in mining. In the 1850s he probably provided lumber for building projects as a carpenter. His photographs of the elaborate wooden structures that were essential to the placer mining process were based on firsthand experience with the materials and an informed understanding of the delicate process of designing and building the structures.
Although theforegroundis a velvety black, the buildings receding behind the New York Grocery & Liquor Store become progressively lighter towards the horizon. The setting sun bathes the facades in light, showing that Carleton Watkins made this exposure late in the afternoon. He took the picture near the present-day anchor of the Bay Bridge, on the east side of the San Francisco peninsula. Before he ever began photographing in the wilderness, Watkins made his earliest outside-the-studio images of the buildings and cities around him--first San Jose, California, and then San Francisco.
Galen Clark, the figure in this photograph, was designated as the guardian of the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia about the time Abraham Lincoln ceded it to California in 1864. When this picture was made, Clark lived in a cabin (not pictured) nearby and maintained a rustic way station for visitors traveling to Yosemite Valley via the Mariposa Trail, which was developed in 1859.
Carleton Watkins's guide into Yosemite Valley, Galen Clark, stands at the thirty-three foot wide base of a sequoia tree known as  the grizzly giant,  legitimizing the larger-than-life tales of the western wilderness. The sequoia's fallen branches at Clark's feet are so large they are the size of ordinary trees. AfterAbrahamLincoln ceded the area to California in 1864, Clark was officially appointed the Guardian of Yosemite. As its caretaker, he received an annual salary of five hundred dollars.
While the monumental facade of El Capitan looms in thebackground, a thin decaying trunk in theforegrounddemands the viewer's attention. In nature, where changes can occur in seconds or centuries, Carleton Watkins found the perfect subjects to convey a theme of transience versus permanence. The same decaying tree appears in this image and itspendant,River View--Down the Valley,which was taken in the same location with the camera directed about thirty degrees to the east.
When Carleton Watkins photographed the remote Yosemite wilderness, America was not yet a century old. Conscious of their country's lack of a national cultural identity, Americans adopted particularly dramatic geologic formations such asCathedralSpires as their version of ancient ruins and soaringGothicchurches. The great pine tree in theforegroundhere became another form of this uniquely American history. Watkins's images helped define America's preference for landscape views depicting rugged wilderness and celebrating spectacular landforms on the grandest of scales.
Sentinel Rock, rising 3,270 feet to the heavens from the base of the Yosemite Valley, was one of the most difficult natural monuments to photograph. On the south side of the valley, along the Merced River, Carleton Watkins found an accessible location and photographed the formation late in the afternoon, benefiting from the setting sun as it highlighted the trees along the riverbank. Though initially overwhelmed by the immensity of the landscape when he first arrived in California in 1851, Watkins went on to successfully render the dramatic scale of western landscape features-mountains, trees, deserts, and oceans.
Reflections on the slow-moving Merced River give this image a sense of melancholy stillness. Further conveying this impression is a dead tree in the center of the image, one of two trees that dominate thecomposition. Among many photographs made by Carleton Watkins, this one juxtaposes the static and the dynamic. Beside the decaying tree, however, a young and healthy one thrives. Adjacent to both is the enduring facade of El Capitan.
The tree was manifestly a very fine one, but we felt disappointed in regard to the apparent size. . . . On looking more attentively and minutely at the photograph, we discovered a group of men at the base of the tree! They were so small that at first, they had escaped notice, but being once seen their effect upon the picture was magical . . . and we felt that we looked indeed upon a grizzly giant.The author of this 1866 quote was, like most observers from afar, astounded by the fantastic proportions of California's scenery. Indeed, the men posed at the base of the tree establish a thrilling sense of scale. In order not to obstruct the view of this grizzly giant, Carleton Watkins isolated as much of the sequoia tree's crown against plain sky as was possible. In so doing, he avoided creating a confusingbackgroundof intermingled trees.
Early visitors to Yosemite saw the valley in religious and historical terms, likening the primordial geological features to the great ruins of Western civilization. Sites such as the Egyptian pyramids and the Roman Colosseum had become familiar through stereographs by European photographers. In this photograph of Cathedral Rock, named for its resemblance to Gothic architecture, Watkins emphasized the monumental quality of the towering granite spires that almost entirely fill the frame.
Watkins returned to Yosemite in 1861 and positioned his mammoth-plate camera at some of the same locations he visited in 1858-59. He refined this composition by moving closer to Vernal Fall, his tripod seemingly amid the flowing water. The passage of time was evident at the fall by the condition of the leaning pine tree at left of center. Here the pine tree is alive, its branches covered with needles, thus establishing its condition in 1861. As time passed, the tree died, thus providing a benchmark for dating later pictures.
This stereograph demonstrates Carleton Watkins's preoccupation with the foreground as a defining element of space in his landscape photographs. Although Yosemite Falls is the principal subject, the strongly vertical trees and the cabin with its diagonal striping of sunlight and shadow dominate the image. Nevertheless, the falls are perfectly framed between the trees just above the cabin, their distance evident in the severe shift in tone between the area of the foreground and the mountains. When viewed through the stereoscope viewer, which gives a three-dimensional effect, the contrast between the planes of focus becomes even more apparent.
To enliven his views, Watkins incorporated reflections whenever possible, and he was one of the first photographers to do so systematically over many decades. Watkins was a master of the reflected image, and this example is one of the best of the genre. He was an avid reader, and he occasionally made literary references when titling his work. In the name for this stereograph, the gray rocks refer to a line from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1824 poem  An April Day. 
The discovery of the Comstock Lode, one of the largest silver deposits ever mined, in June 1859 set off a chain of events that changed the landscape of the West. As in the Gold Rush of 1849, prospectors and miners migrated to the area to seek their fortunes. The New Almaden mine in California was the subject of a five-year lawsuit about the ownership of the mine and lands. Shortly after the case was settled, the victors invited Carleton Watkins to document the trophy they had won, the mine itself. The thirty mammoth-plate images Watkins made of the smelting works reveal his new appreciation for the power of a diagonal viewpoint to expose the geometry of a factory setting.
The coastline along Mendocino was more rugged than any previously encountered by Carleton Watkins, who had traveled by schooner up the coast to the town in the fall of 1863 at the invitation of a lumber mill owner. This image of fog clinging along the edges of jagged bluffs reveals his concern for situations where the static and dynamic elements of nature overlap, a reoccurring theme in his work.
When creating thiscompositionof the Albion River, Carleton Watkins positioned his camera to emphasize the meadow in theforeground. Behind the boundary created by the fence, the river cuts through deeply forested rolling hills, past a lumber mill shrouded in smoke. The stillness of the water belies the fact that the open ocean was less than a hundred yards to the photographer's left. In the center, windblown trees convey the sense of rugged wilderness that Watkins found characteristic of Mendocino County.
Tourists in the late 1800s enjoyed collecting stereographs as mementos of their travels, often purchasing twin images for home stereoscopes or unmounted halves for travel albums. For that reason, Carleton Watkins stocked an inventory of views of all the sightseeing spots in San Francisco. In this stereoscopic set he featured the children of Jessie Frmont, an influential friend who is believed to have inspired Watkins to make his first visit to Yosemite Valley in 1861. Made in San Francisco, near Frmont's Black Point cottage, this image is one of the earliest surviving photographs of nude figures made in California.Gift of Weston J. and Mary M. Naef
Carleton Watkins first photographed the base of the grizzly giant with Galen Clark, Yosemite's caretaker, in 1861. At that time, fallen branches so large they were the size of ordinary trees surrounded the base of the giant sequoia. In this image, taken five years later, the area around the tree had been cleared, giving it a less rugged, more park-like appearance. Although Yosemite Valley attracted artists and wealthy travelers as early as the 1850s, Watkins's images helped to further promotevisitationto the site, especially after the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1859.When Watkins displayed his images of the Big Trees at the 1867ParisInternational Exhibition, he added elegant redwood frames, providing a tactile hint of California for European viewers.
This sweeping view of the Yosemite Valley in winter was made from Inspiration Point on the Mariposa Trail. Yosemite's highest peak, El Capitan, rises at the left, a granite buttress 3,604 feet (1,098 meters) from the valley floor. At center right, almost lost in the photograph's dizzying detail, Bridalveil Fall streams down the mountainside, 620 feet (189 meters) of flowing white mist. Barely visible, Half Dome's crest forms an arc in the snowy center distance. The narrowforegroundstrip reveals that Carleton Watkins's camera was mere feet from the edge of Inspiration Point, giving the viewer a solid sense of being there, literally on the edge.
Carleton Watkins positioned his camera in what appears to be midair, capturing the breathtaking effect of the view of Yosemite Valley on first-time visitors. The wonder and amazement led one spectator to proclaim, ''I can tell you nothing of the beauty and grandeur of the scenery--I could not speak, my breath was gone . . . .It is truly the great work of God.  Such a remark reveals that Watkins's photographs confirmed the sense of wonder celebrated in America's grand wilderness.
Carleton Watkins had the ability to photograph a subject from the viewpoint that allowed the most information to be revealed about its contents. In this image, he captured what he considered the best features of Yosemite Valley: Bridalveil Falls, Cathedral Rock, Half Dome, and El Capitan. By positioning the camera so that the base of the slender tree appears to grow from the bottom edge of the picture, Watkins composed the photograph so that the canyon rim and the open space beyond it seem to intersect. Although he sacrificed the top of the tree, he was able to place the miniaturized Yosemite Falls at the visual center of the picture. To alleviate the monotony of an empty sky, he added the clouds from a second negative.  This image was taken while Watkins was working for the California Geological Survey. His two thousand pounds of equipment for the expedition, which included enough glass for over a hundred negatives, required a train of six mules.
Carleton Watkins created this three-part panorama to convey the natural grandeur of California's Yosemite Valley as he himself saw it from Sentinel Dome. The images successfully convey an illusion of continuity when viewed side-by-side, yet they are also informative compositions when viewed individually.In the summer of 1865, a new word--glacier--entered the vocabulary of terms applied to Yosemite Valley. The geologist Clarence King had hypothesized that glacial forces were responsible for the region's formation. Soon after King's theory was publicized, Watkins succeeded in reaching the summit of Sentinel Dome, the best place to view the evidence of the effect of the ancient glaciers on the valley landscape.
In this photograph of Eagle Creek, Carleton Watkins positioned his camera overlooking the sawmill to sympathetically record a group of trees useful only as lumberyard ornaments. His perspective also allowed him to capture the Oregon Portage Railroad, which was used to carry cut lumber from the Eagle Creek Sawmill, snaking along the banks of the river.When Watkins opened his Yosemite Art Gallery in San Francisco in 1867, he decided that he would stock only his own photographs. A four-month expedition to Oregon and the Columbia River provided hundreds of images for the gallery, including this example.
In 1867 Carleton Watkins made an expedition to Oregon to obtain photographs of its geology, including the chain of extinct volcanic mountains that cap the coastal range. This view was made from the Washington side of the Columbia River. Even the evidence of a solitary boatman and his cargo does not disturb the landscape's profound serenity, nor does his presence reveal the fact that cultivated farmland and an apple orchard existed nearby. Watkins's image nonetheless portrays a man facing nature at its most grand and overwhelming. The man's boat appears ready to launch into the still, glassy river, an act that will make an indelible imprint on the water's pristine, boundless surface.
In Carleton Watkins's expansive vertical photograph, the Multnomah falls enter the frame at the top of the image as though falling from the heavens. The falls boldly bisect the land, dividing the image into a frosty, wintry left half and a lush, spring-like right. The froth eventually plunges into murky, darkened depths. The Multnomah waterfalls are located on a short tributary of the Columbia River that rises in the Larch Mountains of northwestern Oregon. As seen here, the upper and lower Multnomahs fall into the Columbia River Gorge with a combined height of 850 feet and a single drop of 620 feet, one of the longest in the United States.
At the base of the Columbia River Gorge adjacent to the lower falls, Carleton Watkins positioned his 18 x 22-inch camera so that the lens tilted upward. In so doing, he accommodated both the upper and lower falls, the intriguing trunks of various trees, and the face of the gorge itself. The trees on the right seem to tilt as a result of the camera angle he used. Unlike many of the photographs Watkins took on his 1867 expedition to Oregon, his images of Multnomah Falls contain no sky, no negative space. Surrounded by dense forest, simply finding a good viewpoint of the cascades proved difficult.
Looming at the end of a short road is a simple building with stacks of lumber lying about that indicate its recent construction. Two gentlemen observe the facility from a distance, looking down toward the river. When viewed without the right-hand panel that includes the river, the men appear to be simply overlooking a modest plateau. Although this image was created as the left half of a two-part panorama, it easily stands on its own as a result of its compositional integrity.
The tree stumps and lumber strewn throughout theforegroundimply that this facility is still under construction. A group of businessmen stands among the various buildings of their enterprise, at the end of a newly created road. This commanding view overlooking an industrial plant on Oregon's Willamette River belies the fact that it is actually the right half of a two-part panorama. Carleton Watkins's panoramas, which he began making in 1858, included pure landscapes as well as areas of industrial development.
Carleton E. Watkins placed his camera low to the ground to capture these railroad tracks emerging in theforegroundonly to recede into the middle distance and then disappear out of the line of vision. Suchcompositionswere popular in railroad photography. They seemed to encapsulate the spirit of travel by rail, heading off into an unknown, distant landscape. Watkins returned to this central Oregon area numerous times over the years, evidently fascinated with the landscape of the Columbia River basin.
Shortly after opening his Yosemite Art Gallery in San Francisco in 1867, Carleton E. Watkins embarked on a four-month expedition to Oregon and the Columbia River. Among the subjects he photographed while there was the Oswego Ironworks, a newly erected facility that received a great deal of publicity as the first plant on the Pacific Coast to manufacture crude iron in a blast furnace.Unlike most panoramas, which were created to present an illusion of continuity, this two-part view of the ironworks on the Willamette River is barely discernable as a pair. The subtle connection between the individual halves occurs through the corner of the building that extends from the left panel into the right.
Taken at extreme low tide when the transition from land to sea appears seamless, this photograph conveys the stillness encountered at a scarcely populated tourist destination. The horse and carriage on the sand almost disappear against the shadowybackgroundof a rock face, while spectators on the Cliff House balcony observe from above. Watkins repeatedly photographed the Cliff House at Ocean Beach on the northwest edge of San Francisco's peninsula. This structure, the first of San Francisco's four Cliff Houses, burned down on Christmas Day in 1894. Since then, three additional buildings, all named the Cliff House, have stood on this site overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
Although the load-bearing construction of the trestle is a central part of this image, Carleton Watkins trimmed many inches off this picture's edges in an attempt to focus attention on the figures rather than the landscape.More than a dozen Chinese laborers work at laying these tracks in the Sierra Nevada mountains for the Central Pacific Railroad, supervised by a Caucasian foreman in a white shirt and vest. In the mid-1800s, the railroads turned to Chinese and Irish laborers to perform the dangerous work of constructing bridges and lying track in rugged deserts and mountainous terrain. The Central Pacific Railroad recruited many of its Chinese laborers from farms in southern China.
Craggy rocks rise from a swirling, misty sea. Two seagulls punctuate the foreground, giving the scene a sense of scale. The uninhabited Sugarloaf Islands, part of the Farallon Island group, are located just north of San Francisco in the Pacific Ocean; in this photograph, they loom in the surf offshore like mysterious, petrified sea creatures. The length of the exposure softened the waves' swirl into mist, adding to the impression of ancient, craggy mountaintops breaking through vaporous clouds.Carleton Watkins frequently photographed the Farallon Islands. This particular area, the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, includes 1,235 square miles of nearshore and offshore waters ranging from wetlands to deep-sea communities.
The Vallejo Grain Elevator, the tall building at left whose roof meets the horizon line here, was built in 1869 and was designed to accommodate ten thousand tons of wheat. Due to a design flaw, the structure collapsed on September 16, 1872. Grain was brought to the facility via the California Pacific Railroad. The Frisbie House hotel is at right of center, where a dozen white bedsheets dry on lines in the open air. The hotel was named for General John B. Frisbie, an early settler in Vallejo.
In this ornate sleeping car, not even the rowdiest Westerners were allowed to wear their boots to bed. Carleton Watkins photographed this Pullman Palace Sleeping Car shortly after the invention revolutionized rail travel for the American public. Prior to the Pullman car, most rail coaches consisted of little more than rickety wooden boxes with wooden seats or benches, inadequate heating and ventilation systems, and inadequate springs that made for a rough ride. This photograph shows Pullman's elaborately designed coach fitted with his patented folding bed. A carpeted floor, upholstered seats, and black walnut paneling all add to the luxurious interior. In the mirror at the back of the car, Watkins's camera is visible.Pullman's sleeping car was revolutionary for its service as well as its comfort. Courteous employees, efficient baggage handling, and cleanliness made these cars a popular choice for the modestly affluent passenger. Each car was equipped with a hundred sheets and pillowcases, forty blankets, and various towels. The legendary  Pullman porter  enforced company policies, such as the rule against wearing boots to bed.
In this highly detailed overview, Carleton Watkins looked down upon a hydraulic mining operation and recorded the early intrusion of industry upon the landscape. A layered, dense forest surrounds the mine, which recedes into thebackground, subordinated to the stripped and litteredforeground. A diagonal pipe, ferrying precious resources to an unseen destination, bisects the bleak clearing. A lone building in the upper left center peeks out from a crevice, giving a sense of scale. Watkins's lens, encompassing a vastdepth of field, sharply drew each stone and pebble in the mine, each striation of rock.
As in many of Carleton Watkins's landscape photographs, a large, boldforegroundelement and a delicately atmosphericbackgrounddistinguish this image of the English Dam. One of the earliest civil engineering feats on the West Coast, the dam consisted of a 114-foot-tall reservoir constructed from a network of interlocking timber boxes filled with stones. As water filled the area enclosed by the dam, the trees were flooded, leaving white skeletal trunks projecting from the newly formed lake. While documenting the effect of humankind on nature, Watkins's photograph also conveys a spare and unusual beauty with which he seemed to particularly identify.
Barely visible behind the log-and-gravel dam, an impressive structure that blends with the landscape because of the use of natural materials, the glassy lake reflects the standing trees. A tiny figure atop the dam just to the right of center indicates its scale, while the breadth and clarity of Carleton Watkins's view encompasses both the tree-pocked mountaintops and the falls bursting through the dam break at the frame's lower right center edge. The photograph divides neatly into layers defined by shifts in tones, giving the vertical and horizontal lines of tree trunks the overall appearance of striated rock. This image is part of a series that Watkins made of North Bloomfield, Nevada, gravel mines.
Watkins's visits to Yosemite in the mid-1870s are not as well documented as his other trips there. The inventory numbers he assigned to his pictures provide clues and help date pictures such as this one to between 1872 and 1875.
Carleton Watkins's arresting image of the Devil's Slide, an unusual limestone slab formation in Weber Canyon, Utah, was probably made as a souvenir for railroad tourists. Watkins likely traveled aboard this train, which was clearly posed for the photograph. Despite the steam that continues to escape from the engine, the engineer stands in the locomotive's doorway beside the wood supply, far from the controls and looking directly at the photographer.Recognizing that attractive images promoted tourism, railroad officials instructed engineers to be accommodating about stopping for the purposes of photographers.
The density of this enormous tree's branches conveys such monumentality that a viewer hardly notices the charming swing hanging to the right of tree trunk. This small detail reflects the changes that occurred in San Mateo County after 1863, when the railroad completed a connection between San Francisco and the farming village of San Mateo to the south. Formerly rural farms soon gave way to the country estates of California's new wealthy residents. One of those residents, a successful entrepreneur named William Howard, commissioned Carleton Watkins to photograph his lavish estate with its monumental olive tree.
The arrival of Carleton Watkins at a grand residence for a picture session was surely a much-anticipated event. People would have been transfixed watching him erect his two-by three-foot camera fitted with a twenty-five pound lens. When photographing Thurlow Lodge, the home of a former California governor and United States senator, Watkins was expected to concentrate on the buildings and grounds. In this instance, he recognized that a party of seven family members under an umbrella contributed to the picturesque quality of the estate. Waiting to attend to this affluent family is the apron-clad maid, barely visible in the shadow to the left of the palm trees.
While capturing the grandeur of this broad expanse of lawn, Carleton Watkins carefully framed two sculptures within the surrounding trees. He did a good deal of business with newly wealthy residents of California, documenting both the interiors and exteriors of their estates, such as this one. These new millionaires frequently designed their properties after stately English homes, following the late 1800s fashion on the East Coast. Although the West Coast was geographically isolated from such urban centers as Boston and New York, it was not immune to their trends.
The sandy beach, rocky cliffs, rolling hills, and cypress trees of Monterey County provided a splendid landscape for Carleton Watkins during his excursion to photograph the San Carlos Borromeo mission at Carmel. This view presents Gibson Beach, located at the southernmost edge of Point Lobos, on a sunny afternoon devoid of fog. The clarity of Watkins's image allows every detail of the rocky coast to be deciphered, from the delicate cypress trees lining the distant ridge to the wet sand in theforeground.
During the 1870s and 1880s, Carleton Watkins made numerous studies of San Francisco's Chinatown and its inhabitants, often creating formal portraits of prominent Chinese individuals such as this actor. His portraits reveal a deep respect for the integrity of the chief minorities then in California-Native Americans, African Americans, and the Chinese. Watkins employed a Chinese darkroom assistant named Ah Fue, who may have provided him with access to the elite Chinese community located only a few blocks from his studio on Montgomery Street.
When tracks were laid for the new Southern Pacific Railroad, two teams raced to join each other, one moving south through the Central Valley and the other heading north from Los Angeles. Many geological obstacles along the route required innovative solutions, such as the circling Tehachapi Loop seen here.After 1860, the railroad was a persistent subject in Carleton Watkins's photographs. As a close friend of Collis P. Huntington, one of the executives of the Central Pacific Railroad and its extension, the Southern Pacific, Watkins traveled along the railways for many years with complementary annual passes. He essentially functioned as an unofficial photographer of the railroads, often taking images on or near the new tracks.
Forced to rent out space for commercial use, the formerly religious adobe of Mission San Miguel housed the Howe Sewing Machine Agency and a tavern alongside the church itself. The deserted building reflects the condition of most of the California missions, abandoned by the Spanish government in 1810. Established in 1776, the Franciscan mission system involved a network of twenty-one sanctuaries stretching from north to south alongEl Camino Real(the Royal Road). After a series of political conflicts that resulted in the territory known as New Spain seceding from Spain, the mission system began to disintegrate. By the 1870s, when this picture was taken, the mission complexes were the property of secular administrations that had commandeered the buildings, leaving only the actual sanctuary under church control.
Despite the catastrophic financial collapse and unemployment that occurred in the mid-1870s, the San Francisco Mechanics' Institute held an Industrial Exhibition that optimistically displayed an array of agricultural and manufactured products for public consumption, from flavoring extracts to firearms. Although the fountain in the center of the image provides a focal point, it is the surrounding goods neatly displayed along the aisles that demand the viewer's attention. As an artisan himself, Carleton Watkins was a frequent exhibitor in the Mechanics' Institute's fairs.
When tracks were laid for the new Southern Pacific Railroad, two teams raced to join each other, one moving south through the Central Valley and the other heading north from Los Angeles. The main obstacle was the Tehachapi Mountains, outside of Los Angeles. Eighteen tunnels were required for the railroad to pass through this mountain range. The longest one, seen here, stretched for a mile and a half.  After 1860, the railroad was a persistent subject in Carleton Watkins's photographs. As a close friend of Collis P. Huntington, one of the executives responsible for thecreationof the Central Pacific Railroad and its extension, the Southern Pacific, Watkins traveled along the railways for many years with complimentary annual passes. He essentially functioned as an unofficial photographer of the railroads, often taking images on or near the new tracks.
Standing between two sets of rails, Carleton Watkins photographed a busy pair of tracks above Carson Valley, Nevada. His shadow and that of his mammoth-plate camera indicate his precarious position on the steep grade in the foreground. A single engineer stands near the empty track curving around a mountain on the left, having already observed the train that heads away from the trestle on the right. Beneath these tracks, another steam engine pulling lumber on multiple flatbed cars makes its way around a sharp curve. The wood carried by these trains was an essential material for building the railroad and for operating steam engines. Lumber served as ties beneath the iron rails, telegraph poles lining the route, and fuel for wood-burning steam engines.
Unlike today's tripods, which permit multiple angles, those of Carleton Watkins's day allowed only limited maneuverability. The radicalperspectiveemployed when he photographed these treetops required placing the camera on its back after the plate was coated and fitted into place. By masking the corners of this image, Watkins amplified the tree trunks and emphasized their organic character.As Watkins's career progressed, he developed more experimental ways to take photographs. His New Series, images taken after 1876, reflected the technical and aesthetic growth that took place in the fifteen or so years that elapsed since he began as adaguerreotypeoperator.
In a letter to a friend, Carlton Watkins expressed feelings of pride about the landscape images he took following his 1876 lawsuit and subsequent bankruptcy:  Everybody says [the new photographs] are better, softer, more artistic, etc.  After twenty years as a photographer, his mature aesthetic and technical skills seem to have provided Watkins with a sense of confidence, encouraging more experimental approaches to his work. Although the visual concept expressed in this image seems commonplace today, viewpoints such as this did not become popular until after 1900. Watkins had to place his 18 x 22-inch camera on its back to achieve this study of treetops reaching up to the heavens.
In this view of the Yosemite Valley, Carleton Watkins masked the finished print into a circle as a means of conveying a deeper feeling ofperspective.  More of an artist than a businessman,  Watkins lost most of the negatives he had created over a twenty-year period to a competitor after a lawsuit in the mid-1860s. Bankrupt, he eased his pain and replenished his stock by spending most of the summer of 1878 in Yosemite. The images he made during that trip were smaller in format than the previous ones and often made with awide-angle lens.
This compelling photograph presents an austere view of Agassiz Column, a seemingly precarious monument in Yosemite. Carleton Watkins achieved the roundvignetteformat by either photographing or printing through a circular stencil, masking out the square edges. He often experimented with different angles, perspectives, and print formats in his New Series, the images he made after 1876.
This awe-inspiring view of the American River was made from Cape Horn, where the Central Pacific Railroad undertook one of its most daring constructions. Laying a roadbed in the steep terrain of the Sierra Nevada mountain range required difficult grading, leveling, and clearing. Trees, stumps, rocks, and other obstructions had to be removed. Hundreds of barrels of blasting powder were ignited daily to clear the three-mile route. Work began in the summer of 1865 and was completed in less than a year.Carleton Watkins may have been aboard a Central Pacific train when he photographed the canyon lying between twelve and twenty-two hundred feet below the roadbed. He included a tiny portion of the track in theforegroundof the composition-the only indicator of human presence in this wilderness image. Trains following this route often stopped so passengers could take in this thrilling view. Gift in memory of Leona Naef Merrill and in honor of her sister, Gladys Porterfield
In 1862 an Indiana state representative observed that the transcontinental railway   . . . could never be constructed on terms applicable to ordinary roads . . . It is to be constructed through almost impassible mountains, deep ravines, canyons, gorges, and over arid and sandy plains . . .   This photograph of the American River's precipitous canyon illustrates the accuracy of those words. A team of nearly seven thousand men, mostly Chinese, was required to blast and cut the curving roadbed along this three-mile path. To place the blasting powder and light the fuses, men were lowered in chairs or baskets, after which they yelled to a man above to haul them up. Hugging the Cape Horn mountainside, this train paused momentarily with a number of brave men standing on top of its boxcars, overlooking the cavernous gorge some twelve to twenty-two hundred feet below. Trains passing through Cape Horn often stopped so tourists could get out of their cars and gaze at this awe-inspiring gorge and grade.
In 1879 George Davidson of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey invited Watkins to photograph his progress as he established a series of stations along California's Sierra summits. Davidson's team posed with their equipment at the Round Top Observatory. From unstable, sloping ground, Watkins made both a mammoth-plate view and a stereograph, with his cameras tilted upward, making adjustments to avoid distortions of perspective.
Dozens of people on a beach enjoy the benefits of California's moderate climate, which drew a large number of settlers and tourists to the state during this period. Many of San Francisco's prominent families such as the Hearsts, Crockers, and Stanfords, would drive their carriages out to this spot along the beach, not far from San Francisco Bay, for horse racing. Carleton Watkins often photographed such scenes of recreation near the Cliff House. the building perched atop the overhang.Unlike earlier images in which people appeared blurred as a result of long exposure time, this image captures individuals clearly, even as they moved. By the time Watkins created this photograph, the light sensitivity of photographic material had developed to such an extent that more spontaneity was possible and the motion of people and water could be stopped.
The camera angle from Carleton Watkins's position atop a hillside produced a dynamic image with extreme diagonals and numerous triangles. Watkins took this picture at Port Costa off San Pablo Bay, the terminal where transcontinental trains arrived from the east. There, passengers bound for San Francisco transferred from trains to ferry boats for the final leg of their trip. The smoke billowing forth from both the train and the ferry suggest that they have either recently arrived or are about to depart.
During the 1870s and 1880s, Carleton Watkins made numerous studies of San Francisco's Chinatown and its inhabitants. In this dynamiccompositionof a busy street corner, he captured the flavor of everyday life in the city streets, with figures stepping from the street onto the sidewalk and going about their daily activities. Along the eaves, the ornamental cornice nearly dissects the image horizontally before receding into the distance. Watkins intentionally framed the composition to exploit the tiered effect of the building's architecture.
Most of the miners in this rugged settlement took special care to dress for their portrait, appearing in their best white shirts and black jackets. Only the gentleman seated atop the trolley on the left looks as if he has just emerged from the mineshaft. The California Gold Rush peaked in 1852, yet pioneers like those pictured here continued to toil in the mines over twenty years later. While three young children appear in the picture, the women of the town are conspicuously absent. In this depiction of scattered homes carved into a barren mountainside, Carleton Watkins conveyed the isolation of the prospecting and pioneering western frontier.
In this image celebrating Kern County's agricultural bounty, Carleton Watkins clearly defined each fresh grape, tooth-edged leaf, and woody twig. Real estate developers successfully used photographs of lush fields, ripe produce, and plentiful harvests as a means of advertising to boost Southern California's economy. The grape bunches hanging from the tendrils of this vine represent the earliest cultivation of seedless grapes.
Rooted above the rocky Monterey coastline, this elegant cypress tree clings to the edge of the cliff as decaying windblown branches lie all around it. Carleton Watkins chose to photograph Cypress Point while the thick fog characteristic of the Monterey peninsula engulfed the coastline. By doing so, he obstructed the view of the Pacific Ocean's glassy surface and allowed the fog to blend seamlessly into the gray sky. When Watkins took this photograph, scientists were already aware that this cypress species,cuppressus macrocarpa, was disappearing from its native habitat.
Many affluent Northern California residents commissioned Carleton Watkins to photograph their properties. Among these residents was Milton S. Latham, a former California governor and United States senator who purchased Thurlow Lodge in 1872 as a home for his new bride. After photographing the lavish Menlo Park estate that was originally built for one of the owners of the New Almaden quicksilver mine, Watkinsprepareda pair of sumptuous presentation albums, each containing sixty-three mammoth views of the house and grounds.
Carleton Watkins began photographing California's colossal trees as early as 1860, recognizing both their historical and aesthetic significance. To people outside the state, tales of the grandeur of those trees seemed like folklore. To provide a sense of scale, Watkins often placed a figure at the base of the tree, as in this image of a giant redwood. The sign posted on the tree at the left advertises a  Moonlight Party in the Big Trees,  while to the right of the redwood, a platform suitable for dancing awaits.
Carleton Watkins's image of iron rails piercing the wilderness embodies the American notion of Manifest Destiny popular in the 1800s-the idea of the necessity of territorial expansion westward to the Pacific and even beyond. The railroad's development allowed access to remote places; and, as towns and commercial ventures grew up in its wake, the patterns of humans overlaid those of nature.The aesthetic success of this photograph results from the choice Watkins made when he printed the image, as well as how and when it was composed. To achieve the rich purple-black tones of this print, he exposed the negative for longer than usual and then bathed the print in gold chloride.
Carleton Watkins skillfully composed this picture around a line that begins near the middle of the rocks and continues along the water's surface to the right edge of the photograph. Varying tones left by shifting water levels create an echoing sequence of horizontal planes on the rock formation to the left. In the foreground, a gentleman and his rowboat provide a sense of scale.Watkins may have made this photograph for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company as a means of documenting the Columbia River's fluctuating water levels.
At first glance, this image appears to be ordered along the horizontal lines of stone plateaus and distant rolling hills. In fact, Carleton Watkins used two diagonal lines beginning at the lower corners of the photograph and converging in the center of the image as the foundation for thecomposition. The result is a triangle that accentuates the intersection of multiple terraces.  In 1884 Watkins was hired to photograph mining works in the Montana region. During the trip, however, he also photographed natural monuments such asMinerva'sTerrace in the Mammoth Hot Springs area of Yellowstone National Park. Although the picture gives the impression of isolated and untouched  wilderness,  at least four buildings are visible in the distance.
Relationships between small and large, dark and light, and man and nature are all evident in this monumental portrait of a giant coastal redwood in Santa Cruz, California. Carleton Watkins, the photographer, composed this image with two diminutive figures at the base of the behemoth to illustrate the tree's grand scale. While the sun beams down across the left side of the photograph, a dark shadow fills theforeground. Watkins made numerous pictures of California's trees, predominantly in Yosemite and Santa Cruz, throughout the late 1800s. His photographs were exhibited on the East Coast, testifying to people that the outlandish stories they had read and heard about the western wilderness were true. Watkins's pictures were instrumental in the successful effort to reserve Yosemite as a national park.
The first photographs Watkins made along the Kern River served as evidence in a water rights lawsuit that eventually resulted in a decisive court ruling that prevented newcomers from diverting water from existing landowners. James Ben Ali Haggin, the defendant and Watkins's client, had a series of irrigation canals that raised the price of land in Kern County. In this spare composition, made where present-day Poso Road crosses the Calloway Canal, Watkins devoted almost equal proportions to sky, land, and water.
In 1880 Carleton Watkins spent almost two weeks in Los Angeles, where he was transfixed by the process of water transforming a vacant landscape into bountiful fields. In this picture of a young orchard, the receding rows of saplings create a compellinggeometriccomposition. After the financial collapse of 1873, Collis P. Huntington, one of the executives of the Southern Pacific Railroad, devised a plan to sell real estate along the railroad's right-of-way for agricultural purposes. Watkins's appealing photographs of successful orchards and farms contributed to the success of Huntington's plan.
Standing atopMountSanta Lucia in northern California at approximately 3:50 p.m. on January 1, 1889, Carleton Watkins was able to make only one exposure during the instant of complete eclipse. Accompanied by professors from the newly created University of California and the United States Naval Observatory, Watkins waited slightly more than an hour for the moon to begin its movement and assume its temporary position directly in front of the sun. The radiating sun, its brilliance hidden by the black moon, lies suspended over a sea of clouds whose rippling waves dominate the sky. Only the inclusion of the treetops in theforegroundserves to ground the image in a familiar reality.
A young woman lies on her bed, provocatively displayed in the nude, while a nurse leans attentively over her, ready to administer an enema. Jean-Antoine Watteau drew the scene with perfect mastery, using a subtle patterning of red, black and white chalk lines to create shadows and highlights. In drawings such as this one, he made this technique, known astrois crayons, famous. He sketched the nurse's head twice, trying two different angles over another study of the model's head.Watteau made this highly finished drawing in preparation for a painting now in the Norton Simon Museum. The severely trimmed painting lacks the nurse and severs the nude below her knees.
It was [Jean-Antoine Watteau's] habit to make his drawings in a bound book, so that he always had a large supply of them at hand. When he was in the mood to paint a picture, he resorted to his collection of drawings and chose the figures most suited for the occasion.Just as this early biographer described, Watteau made this drawing as a study of women's costumes and movement. The central figure later appeared in his painting,Embarkation for Cythera, a diploma piece that gained him membership in theAcadmie Royalein 1717; the right figure appeared in another painting.Watteau may have first learned the three-colored chalk technique calledtrois crayonsby studying Peter Paul Rubens's drawings. This example shows his mastery of the technique and of composition. Watteau achieved brilliant color effects not only through the sensitivity of his line but also by setting down each chalk separately, rather than mixing the three colors. Although each figure is a separate study, Watteau arranged the three elements to create a pleasing, balanced composition.
This sheet of three studies shows two views of a man playing a flute next to the head of a boy looking on. Jean-Antoine Watteau observed the flutist from life and captured his expression of keen concentration as he blows his breath through pursed lips and the elegant movement of his fingers on the keys of the instrument.Watteau was a master of the technique known in French astrois crayons, a combination of red, black, and white chalks, usually on tinted paper. Here he suggested texture by the play of light on drapery and other details such as the shape of the musician's long, tapered fingers, the sweep of his wavy hair, and the softness of the white lace around his wrists.
Using a delicate pattern of red chalk lines to illustrate the play of light on the folds of the woman's silk dress, Jean-Antoine Watteau portrayed an elegant young woman in an unself-conscious pose. Black chalk strokes accentuate elements of emphasis: the closed fan in her hands, the outline of the edges of her dress, and the deep shadow behind her. White lines add areas of highlights. Watteau particularly favored the effects of  combining three colors of chalk, red, black and white, a technique known astrois crayons.Watteau probably sketched the figure as a life study, not in preparation for a particular painting. Later, when he required a particular gesture or movement for one of his paintings, he would have referred back to this drawing. The breathtaking simplicity and elegance of this sketch display his virtuosity and inventiveness; others said that even Watteau preferred his drawings to his paintings.
Five comedians have just finished their performance in a verdant park on the outskirts of Paris and look expectantly at their audience. Pierrot, the clown in a baggy white suit, is already holding his hat in his hand, hoping that a few coins might be thrown into it.Flanking Pierrot are four other performers dressed as characters from the Italiancommedia dell'arte, which enjoyed great popularity in 18th-century Paris. Brighella wears a splendid greenish-gold suit and shoulder cape trimmed with black stripes. Mezzetin strums a few chords on his guitar, while Harlequin in a black mask with its horsehair eyebrows and moustache peers over his shoulder. A mock Spanish costume of black velvet with a white ruff identifies the figure on the far right as Scaramouche.The actors penetrate our world with an intense humanity and vivid reality, far removed from the theatrical artifice and caprice of the stage they have just left.
A dramatic nighttime fire at a New York City kitchen products factory provided Weegee with an opportunity to exhibit some wry humor. Just below where the water cannons douse the fire, and almost centered in the frame, a sign reads  SIMPLY ADD BOILING WATER.  Weegee's intentionally ironic composition enhanced his chance of selling the image to newspapers, something that was always in the forefront of his mind as a freelance photographer.Weegee's dramatic high contrast print nevertheless subtly reveals the tones of the building's facade at night. Glaring white ambulance lights, lamplight, and chutes of water from a fire truck mix with the ghostly glow of fire and steam. Using a combination of flashbulbs, and by some accounts flash powder, Weegee generated enough light to capture this scene.
I spotted this happy man coming out of the church ... he told me that he was a clothing salesman ... and that every Easter Sunday he puts on his full dress suit.--Weegee fromNaked City(1945)At a time of racial tension in many parts of the United States, Weegee's photographs showed an unusual sensitivity in their portrayal of minorities. Here, an African-American man in his best suit is surrounded by other churchgoers on Easter Sunday, 1940. Resplendent in coattails, top hat, and striped pants, the man radiates respectability and authority. His tired eyes are overshadowed by his brilliant smile. Compositionally, his top hat forms the peak of a triangle containing two women in white hats, one in the foreground, the other behind and to the right. Weegee's flash illuminates the man, a woman, and a well-dressed boy, while a cluster of other people crowd the scene from within the shadows.
January 16, 1941. Gunman doesn't want his picture taken. Police today permitted photographers in the line-up room at headquarters. The subject was Anthony Esposito, under indictment with his brother William for the murder of a businessman and a policeman in Tuesday's tragic Battle of Fifth Ave. The detectives, manacled to Esposito, didn't want their names or pictures in the papers. They obliged by turning around, holding the gunman by head and arm so he couldn't duck. The yardstick is on the line-up platform where Esposito had stood, refusing to answer questions. He looked like a stubborn surly, snarling animal,  Weegee reported.  He stumbled and sagged over to one side, like a drunk. -- published inWeegee's WorldNew York tabloid photographer Weegee created this image of a murder suspect in his aggressive trademark style. Standing back about six to ten feet with his Speed Graphic camera, he blasted his flash, giving Esposito a vulnerable look. This visual starkness is relieved only by Weegee's impeccable sense of humor, which he expresses by emphasizing the details of the detectives' trench coats and the height chart that appears to emerge from one's head.
Weegee claimed that he knew when a crime, fire, or car crash would occur because his elbows would itch. It certainly helped that he lived behind police headquarters; so did having a hook-in at the foot of his bed with the police alarms and fire gongs  so that if anything happens . . . I'm notified.  Paying off informants and having a special radio tuned to the police frequency in his '38 Chevy coupe also kept Weegee informed of illicit activity. Weegee established himself as a crime photographer, partly because he was one of the few photographers who would work the night shift. He often pushed past the police to record scenes of murders, car crashes, fires, and crimes such as the robbery at this luncheonette, where detectives pull a burglar from a store window.
 A woman relative cried...but neighborhood dead-end kids enjoyed the show when a small-time racketeer was shot and killed,  wrote Weegee in the caption accompanying this startling photograph in his 1945 publicationNaked City.On the facing page Weegee showed the bloody body lying in the street.Alternately laughing, staring in disbelief, or looking into the camera to grasp their own momentary chance to be recorded, the children who had witnessed this grisly scene form an unsettling amalgam of human emotion and self-absorption. Two women are among the group: one, whom Weegee mentioned above, stands at the center, her face contorted with anguished tears, her personal loss turned into public spectacle.
 I go around wearing rose-colored glasses. In other words, we have beauty. We have ugliness. Everybody likes beauty. But there is an ugliness... --Weegee, in a July 11, 1945 interview for WEAF radio, New York CityWhile Weegee's work appeared in many American newspapers and magazines, his methods would sometimes be considered ethically questionable by today's journalistic standards. In this image, a drunk woman confronts two High Society women who are attending the opera. Mrs. George Washington Kavanaugh and Lady Decies appear nonplussed to be in close proximity to the disheveled woman. Weegee's flash illuminates their fur wraps and tiaras, drawing them into the foreground. The drunk woman emerges from the shadows on the right side, her mouth tense and open as if she were saying something, hair tousled, her face considerably less sharp than those of her rich counterparts.The Criticis the second name Weegee gave this photograph. He originally called it,The Fashionable People.In an interview, Weegee's assistant, Louie Liotta later revealed that the picture was entirely set up. Weegee had asked Liotta to bring a regular from a bar in the Bowery section of Manhattan to the season's opening of the Metropolitan Opera. Liotta complied. After getting the woman drunk, they positioned her near the red carpet, where Weegee readied his camera to capture the moment seen here.
Weegee made this photograph at a cheap hotel, otherwise known as a flophouse, along the Bowery, New York's notorious skid row. In the first half of the 1900s, the Bowery's mile-long stretch of bars, missions, and hotels was home to an estimated 25,000 men. Weegee often photographed these down-and-out characters, and was probably doing so on the evening that he made this photograph.As the stairs recede toward the top of the image, each step appears narrower then the one below it--lending the words  U.S. Hotel  a powerful perspectival effect. The bold repetition of the hotel's name reveals Weegee's fascination with photography's graphic potential.
At No. 267 Bowery, sandwiched in between Missions and quarter-a-night flophouses, is  Sammy's,  the poor man's Stork Club. There is no cover charge nor cigarette girl, and a vending machine dispenses cigarettes. Neither is there a hat check girl. Patrons prefer to dance with their hats and coats on. But there is a lively floor show...the only saloon in the Bowery with a cabaret license.So Weegee described the setting of this spirited photograph, a rousing portrait of two colorful clubgoers, each treating the photographer to a glimpse of healthy gams. The woman on the left displays a stockinged calf, paper money inserted for safekeeping and her foot bulging out of her shiny T-strap pump. The toothy smiles and ribald gestures of the two women are infectious, infusing the image with a good-time charm and personality.
The men, women, and children who commit murders always fascinate me...I will say one thing for the men and women who kill...they are Ladies and Gentlemen...cooperating with me so I will get a good shot of them.-- Weegee fromNaked CityIn this classic Weegee image, sixteen-year old Frank Pape sits in a  pie wagon,  accused of strangling a four-year old boy. Weegee often used windows and fences as visual elements to frame and thus draw attention to his subjects. Here, the wagon door's chain-link fencing creates a dominant pattern, brightened by proximity to Weegee's intense flashbulb. The fence seems to isolate Pape's face and hands within diamonds of crisscrossing wire. This draws attention to the youth's lost-in-thought expression and symbolically hints at his narrowing options.
Weegee took candid photographs of the people he encountered in the often seamy clubs of New York. Working in these darkened places required the use of flashbulbs, which would illuminate the scene for a split second, causing intense highlights. In this portrait of a woman dancing, her face takes on a mask-like quality as the light harshly outlines her features.
The subject of thisbust, sprouting from a cluster of palm leaves, looks out with an expression revealing the intelligence, compassion, and strength for which she became known inVictorianEngland. An extraordinary Jamaican woman, Mary Seacole traveled extensively in Central and South America, where she learned to treat yellow fever and cholera. During the Crimean War, she followed the troops as a sutler, one of the many people offering hospitality services and running inns, bars, and restaurants. In the Ukraine, in addition to running a hotel, she supplied medical services to British troops on the front line, remaining even longer than her fellow nurse Florence Nightingale. After the war, Seacole published her autobiography,The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands,which became a huge popular and commercial success. By the time Henry Weekes executed this bust in 1859, she was a household name in England.  Emphasizing her innate nobility, Weekes used a simple oval form for the chest, adorning the mature woman with only a necklace and the hoop earrings that she always wore. The unusual socle covered with palm leaves refers to Seacole's Jamaican origins, considered tropical and exotic by the English.
From the 1750s onwards, the SvresPorcelainManufactory supplied variousmarchands-mercierswith porcelain plaques that were then incorporated into various forms of furniture and other items. Dealers ordered the plaques directly from Svres and then passed them over tobnisteslike Adam Weisweiler with specific orders about the object they should ornament. Themarchandscould therefore offer their clients considerable choice over the final design. In 1785 Weisweiler became the main supplier of furniture mounted with Svres plaques to the dealer Dominique Daguerre.On this work, the porcelain plaques were probably produced before the final position and form of the secrtaire had been determined. The two oval plaques on each side are painted to be viewed horizontally, but they are mounted vertically, with their groups of musical instruments tilted awkwardly on their sides. This orientation suggests that they were not originally intended to be mounted on the same piece of furniture as the three rectangular plaques set on the front.
Northern European tourists and collectors in the 1600s and 1700s eagerly acquiredpietre dure(hardstone) plaques and mosaic scenes produced by Roman craftsmen on trips to Italy. When the travelers returned home, they had these souvenirs mounted onto boxes and furniture.The hardstone plaques on this pair of cabinets all date from the late 1600s; they were probably made by Italian craftsmen working in Paris at the Gobelins Manufactory. Because of their value and continued popularity with collectors, these plaques were mounted in cabinets specially designed to hold them, nearly one hundred years after their creation.The catalogues of two sales held during the French Revolution describe this cabinet. William Beckford, a wealthy English connoisseur of hardstones, probably purchased it in the late 1700s. He may have ordered another cabinet made to match it, with identical gilt bronze mounts and dimensions.

Among the two thousand participants at the 1848 abolitionist convention in upstate New York, there were nearly fifty runaway slaves. This small image features the legendary Edmonson sisters, both dressed in plaid, and the famous orator and escaped slave Frederick Douglass, seated between the two sisters. Thisdaguerreotypewas given to imprisoned abolitionist William Chaplin, who had helped many of the attendees escape to freedom. The photographic record enabled Chaplin to share in the convention's success and to see the vastness of the assembled crowd.
Hector, the commander of the Trojan armies, readies himself to depart for battle while his wife Andromache weeps on his shoulder. Their son Astyanax whimpers in the arms of his nurse, frightened by Hector's plumed helmet and spear. Benjamin West, like many artists, was impressed by the grandeur and simplicity of ancient Greek art. He chose this classical subject, drawn from Homer'sIliad, for two paintings as well as this drawing.The drawing's provenance is unusual. West dedicated this work to the Polish patriot Thaddeus Kosciuszko during the Pole's brief visit to London in June 1797 after his release from a Russian prison. They met on June 7, and Kosciuszko received the drawing three days later. By December he had moved to Philadelphia, where he became close friends with then-vice president Thomas Jefferson. Kosciuszko later presented the drawing to Jefferson, who kept it at his home Monticello.
In this small, oval portrait, Flora Weston, Edward Weston's first wife, carefully holds young Edward Chandler Weston, their first child. The photograph is mounted on a page in an album that Flora compiled of images of the infant Chandler. Below the print are inscribed in pencil the words, probably in Flora's hand,  One Month old.  Chandler's expressive, alert face is lovingly photographed by his father. The intimacy of the moment is conveyed through the close cropping of the oval shape, carefully trimmed to frame the interaction of mother and child.
A shimmering, gossamer river of fabric winds across the floor and envelops the draped body of model Yvonne Verlaine. In the background above her head, more fabric is hung, both framing and becoming one with the subject as the materials melt together. Two elongated teardrops of light punctuate the darkness like exclamation points. Edward Weston's possible inspiration for this costume study was a poem entitled  The Goldfish in a Bowl. 
Early in Edward Weston's career in the 1910s his style was Pictorialist. Soon, however, he began to move toward a different approach. This soft-focus portrait of Betty Katz (later Brandner) reveals the early influence of Pictorialism but is also Modernist in its self-conscious use of space and form as subjects of the photograph. Weston subordinated Katz's figure to the graphic abstraction of the large rectangles that she appears to hold up. The print's muted tones flatten the image's depth, reducing the room to a two-dimensional space.
My eyes and thoughts were heavenward indeed--until glancing down, I saw Tina lying naked on the azotea, taking a sunbath. My cloud  sitting  was ended, my cameraturneddown toward a more earthly theme...-Edward WestonDistracted from his original goal of photographing clouds, Edward Weston made this nude portrait of his lover, Tina Modotti, on the terrace rooftop of their temporary Mexico City home. Stretched out with her hands tucked under her back, her figure forms a series of arcing and sweeping lines that draws the viewer's eyes from her forehead to her breasts, rib cage, stomach, and thighs. Weston made this image when the sun was high overhead, resulting in a small shadow under the arch of her back. His elevated and diagonal angle exploited the formal qualities of Modotti's curvaceous figure.Modotti was not simply Weston's lover and model; she exerted an enormous influence on his creative vision during their years together in Mexico. She arranged for his first exhibition in Mexico City, introduced him to many prominent artists, served as his language interpreter, and worked as his darkroom assistant. Weston taught her photography. During this critical period they inspired one another--each developing a unique, modernist vision.
The bird is a beauty indeed--a blue heron, bill and feet red, neck turned over its back to almost a completed circle--a lovely thing in line, but done by nature (albeit nature improved by man) for the bird is a painted gourd.Edward Weston's affinity for Mexico's gourds, hand-painted by local craftsmen, was such that he both photographed and wrote about these brightly decorated creations. Since ancient times Mexican artisans have been using gourds as vessels and ornaments. Enamored of their graceful shapes, Weston collected a number of these traditional folk artifacts during his three-year stay in Mexico and used them in photographs taken almost twenty years after he returned to the United States.
The faint vertical lines of the corrugated tin siding, softly bisected by horizontal lines where the sheets of metal are joined, establish a vertical thrust in this composition. The bold diagonal lines of the roofs intersect the anonymous-looking structure in dynamic bursts, while the three dark forms of windows and pipe balance the graphic tone of the image. A fine layer of white dust coats the visible surfaces, presumably from the smokestacks spewing a white cloud overhead.
Edward Weston was fascinated with Mexico's stirring sky, which he found to be far more inspiring than Southern California's blue expanses. Writing in his daybook, he expressed his concern:  Clouds have been tempting me again. Next to the recording of a fugitive expression, or revealing the pathology of some human being, is there anything more elusive than cloud forms!  The sky changed so rapidly in Mexico that Weston bemoaned the difficulty of making a two-second exposure. Throughout the three-year period that he spent in Mexico, from 1923 to 1926, Weston repeatedly photographed the restless clouds sweeping overhead.
 It is this very combination of the physical and spiritual in a shell...which makes it such an important abstract of life,  wrote Edward Weston of his still life compositions of seashells. Bored with portraiture, Weston began to experiment with the symbolic and formal potential of objects he found. By nesting one chambered nautilus shell inside another, he created a powerful sinuous form not seen in nature. The polished surface of the shells reflects the light, interrupting the sensual curve with piercing highlights. The shells stand in bold relief against the stark black background.
To clearly express my feeling for life with photographic beauty, present objectively the texture, rhythm, form in nature, without subterfuge or evasion in technique or spirit, to record the quintessence of the object or element before my lens, rather than an interpretation, a superficial phase, or passing mood-- this is my way in photography.So wrote Edward Weston in 1927, the year in which he made this still life composition. The skin of the fruit is rendered in precise detail, with the bruises and marks on the bananas becoming graphic strokes of the camera's  brush.  The pocked surface of the citrus fruit is also clearly delineated, while the orange's center reveals an anomalous organic form.
A woman's torso is photographed from behind, her head bent forward so drastically that only an insignificant mound of shadowy flesh represents the place where it logically should be. The soft spread of her buttocks forming a clean line across the seat makes her legs appear truncated; her remaining body is neatly sliced off and placed upon a kind of pedestal, transformed into a piece of abstract sculpture bearing little resemblance to a human form. Edward Weston's sharp-focus photograph carefully outlines the body and simultaneously conveys its disparate abstract beauty.
After seeing an exhibition of his photographs at the University of California at Los Angeles, the dancer Bertha Wardell volunteered to model for Edward Weston. She soon became a friend and lover, modeling for him in the spring of 1927 at his Glendale studio. Weston particularly admired her dancer's combination of strength and grace, writing that  her beauty in movement is an exquisite sight. 
Harald Kreutzberg, a leading figure in the German modern dance movement, was known for his trademark shaved head, elaborate costumes, and elegant, expressive hand gestures. Edward Weston saw him perform in Carmel, California, in 1932. Though emotionally unmoved by the performance, Weston nonetheless asked the dancer if he could make his portrait. To neutralize what he deemed Kreutzberg's forced, theatrical poses, Weston isolated his expressive form against the sky.
The vegetable's elongated, misshapen limbs twist and curve around each other. Its texture is like hair-pocked skin, and the broken root at the base of the photograph suggests a traumatic upheaval from the ground. So strongly reminiscent of the human body, this is a disturbing image, evoking physical deformities and human violence. Photographed against grass that is barely visible, like scratches in the background, the radish hovers above its natural setting while remaining eerily removed from it.
The natural world was an important subject for Modernist photographers in America. A leader of the movement, Weston used a sharp-focus approach to transform ordinary subjects into extraordinary explorations of form. Here he elegantly organized deep shadows cast beneath brightly lit crests of sand, creating a composition in which space and scale are largely absent. A glimpse of the distant coastline allows the image to hover between pure abstraction and recognizable landscape.
Charis Wilson, Edward Weston's then-girlfriend and future wife, sits upon a blanket in a doorway. Wilson's head is bowed against her leg, obscuring her face. Her body and the shadows created between her legs and arms become a formal study of triangles and lines defined by light and gesture. Although not abstract, the shape of her body is graphic; even the crooked part in her pinned-back hair assumes a formal quality over and above casual detail. Wilson is slightly off-center, with the diagonal extension of her legs and feet pointing both forward and back, balancing her within the frame.
What inspired Edward Weston to photograph this dilapidated park bench surrounded by weeds  In many ways, this image resembles a still-life painting. By focusing on a simple, everyday object, Weston invites viewers to contemplate a subject they might otherwise ignore. As the centerpiece of the photograph, the bench is transformed from a commonplace piece of furniture to a graphic study of rhythmic, horizontal bands. The weathered finish and broken bottom band are telling signs of age; like the discarded comics page, they suggest that this park bench has provided a restful stop for many weary visitors.
It was his first view of the East, and the ballet of forms obsessed him-door and alley and rooftop, the thrust and stress of tower and bridge, the shadow of fire escapes, the million windows and the face of walls.-Nancy NewhallThis contact print, made from an 8-by-10-inch negative, is so sharp that you can clearly see the  for sale  items in the Whelan's display windows. Dance studio advertisements above are so crisp that their texts read like an optometrist's chart at 20 20 vision.When Brett Weston came across this facade, he must have been attracted to its striking visual geometry: the almost-identical pairs of dancers in the advertisements and the script  Whelan's  repeated twice over the drugstore windows. The way in which Weston composed this picture further emphasizes its rhythmic patterns. Weston chose the right time of day and printed the photograph with high contrast to create alternating, horizontal bands of light and dark.After joining a photographic unit of the Signal Corps during World War II, Weston was sent to New York City to study photography. But his already-considerable skill enabled him to complete assignments quickly, leaving time to pursue his own photographic interests. In his free time, Weston wandered the city with a cumbersome 8-by-10-inch camera and made images such as this, in which the literal and the abstract coexist.  Such dual qualities became a consistent thread throughout his oeuvre.
Brett Weston saw something interesting in the most commonplace subjects, which he often transformed into abstract arrangements of pattern and texture in his prints. By moving in close to eliminate context, Weston de-emphasized the cultural significance of his often-humble subjects.Here, Weston played with the viewer's sense of three-dimensional space by focusing on a window with lace curtains and potted plants, and the reflection of a building from across the street. He positioned the camera in such a way that the flowers embroidered on the curtain appear to be sprouting from the pots sitting on the window's ledge.The reflection of the photographer's camera is seen in the lower right hand corner-a dark shape with rounded corners and a tripod leg that appears to jut from the plant container on the far right.The scene is easily recognizable, but it takes a moment to understand the relationship between the various parts. This sort of ambiguity is what makes Weston's photographs intriguing.
A cut-away wall reveals a small bedroom where an angel appears to Pope Sergius in his sleep. The angel tells Sergius that the bishop Saint Lambert has been assassinated and Sergius is to appoint a new bishop, Saint Hubert. The angel holds a bishop's miter and crozier formerly belonging to Saint Lambert. To the right, the Pope and two cardinals go out into a brick enclosure, meeting a lawyer or noble and a Franciscan friar, who both kneel before the papal retinue and present petitions requesting benefits or indulgences. In the far distance, on the steps of the early Saint Peter's Cathedral, Pope Sergius presents Saint Hubert with the bishop's miter and staff.The artists made an imaginative effort to recreate Rome as it would have appeared at that time. The depiction of minutely detailed objects and the ability to portray space in a convincing manner were among the major achievements of Netherlandish painters in the 1400s.The Dream of Pope Sergiusand its companion,The Exhumation of Saint Hubertin the National Gallery, London, were probably wings from a lost altarpiece that stood in the Chapel of Saint Hubert in the church of Saint Gudule, Brussels.
Seated with her hands crossed in her lap, Isabella of Portugal, the duchess of Burgundy, conveys the poise and confidence of her noble position. Her sumptuous attire, heavily woven with gold thread, and her jeweled fingers and headdress reflect her aristocratic status. Oddly, the artist did not match the patterns of the sleeves, as would have been customary during this period.In fact, the duchess never actually sat for this portrait, which may account for the misunderstood representation of her clothing. Scholars believe that the artist copied Isabella's likeness from a lost portrait by Rogier van der Weyden. The tender, slightly mocking expression on the duchess's face and the elongated fingers reflect van der Weyden's concept of portraiture.The prominent inscription in the upper left corner of the panel,PERSICA SIBYLLA IA,suggests that the portrait was part of a series depicting sibyls. This identity strikingly contrasts with Duchess Isabella's costume. Scholars believe that someone other than the original artist added the inscription, as well as the brown background meant to simulate wood, some time after the portrait was painted.
Two of Christ's followers,Joseph of ArimatheaandNicodemus, carry his body from the cross to the tomb. Mary, his mother, kneels and pulls her son's face close to hers for one last moment, while Mary Magdalene kneels tearfully at his feet in splendid brocaded robes. Death has transformed Christ's green-tinged, rigid body in horrific detail: his hands are clenched into agonized claws, bloody scars from his Crown of Thorns dot his forehead, and his wounds are graphically evident.The artist, a follower of Rogier van der Weyden, based this painting on Weyden'saltarpiece, now in the Prado in Madrid. As Weyden did, this artist described faces, fabrics, and objects in great detail and arranged the figures as though in afrieze. The shallow space is further limited by the use of the gold-stippledbackground.
Granted anything he could wish for, King Midas desired that everything he touched be turned to gold. He soon realized his mistake, however, when even the food that he handled became inedible. Here the bearded god Dionysus, crowned with a wreath of vine leaves, allows the penitent Midas, who stands on the right, to wash away his powers in the River Pactolus. Asatyrwith his pipes crouches at the god's feet, whilenymphscluster around.Hermann Weyer copied thecompositionof another artist's painting for this drawing, which Weyer made as an independent work. He used different types of strokes to build up the scene, from simple lines with sparse hatching on the figures to a complex layering of ink, wash, andheighteningon the foliage at the back. Sweeps of wash give form and volume to the bodies of the nymphs.
The Duc de Choiseul, seen on the left, lived large. Through industry and intrigue, he rose to become the most powerful person in France after KingLouis XV, amassing a great fortune and spending it extravagantly on, among other things, an outstanding collection of paintings. Choiseul helped launch the career of Hubert Robert, whose father was Choiseul's father's valet, by finding him a post as cook in theAcadmie de Francein Rome. Choiseul was once characterized as  a wonderful mixture of selfishness and charm and recklessness and exquisite taste.  In 1770 Louis XV fired the duke, who retreated to the Choiseul estate, Chanteloup, in the Touraine region of central France.Here, the dedicated womanizer Choiseul is shown in exile with his mistress Madame de Brionne and the Abb Barthlemy, the learned curator of the king's collection of antiquities and a close friend and adviser of the duke and his duchess. Jacques Wilbaut painted the trio in an informal moment at the duke's chteau. Against a relatively simple backdrop, Wilbaut showcased the elegance of their clothing while capturing the tenderness and genuine affection they shared for one another.
On May 4, 1799, General Sir David Baird stormed the southern Indian city of Mysore with his British troops. During the violent battle, Tipu Sahib, the last independent sultan of Mysore, was killed. His death, which led to the city's final surrender, marked the final consolidation of British rule in India.Sir David Wilkie based hiscompositionon a contemporary account of the scene:  About dusk, General Baird, in consequence of information he had received at the palace, came with lights to the gate, accompanied by the late Killadar [Governor of the Fort], and others, to search for the body of the sultan; and after much labor it was found and brought from under a heap of slain to the inside of the gate. Baird stands in the gateway under which Tipu received his death wound.Wilkie took much care with the design; he took nearly four years and produced numerous preparatory drawings before completing the final painting. This drawing shows an early stage in the development of the composition.
Thisdaguerreotypestereographimage by Thomas Richard Williams is a still lifememento moricomposition. An assemblage of a human skull, an hourglass with the sand running out, an extended compass, and a book abandoned mid-read with eyeglasses placed upside down on the page, the image evokes the temporary nature of mortal life and the inevitability of death. The objects also refer to intellectual pursuits and to the inevitable triumph of the soul over the mind.
Long locks of hair fall over the forehead of this figure, but they do not obscure his intense and questioning gaze. It is the gaze of an ancient philosopher and thebustwas indeed modeled after a celebratedantiquesculpture once identified as Seneca, the first-century Roman philosopher and statesman. The figure's rugged and even unkempt appearance, suggesting a lack of refinement, seems to have provoked the association with Seneca who was born in Spain and perceived inclassicalRome as a provincial foreigner.For art enthusiasts who could not afford the real thing, antique replicas could be acquired from one of many eighteenth-century English sculptors, likeJosephWilton, who spent time in Italy. The statesman Charles Watson-Wentworth either commissioned this bust directly from Wilton or purchased it from the sculptor's stock. Along with Joseph Nollekens's statues ofVenus,Minerva, andJuno, the bust was incorporated into aNeoclassicaldecorative scheme, perhaps first in Watson-Wentworth's London townhouse and then later in his country house. Both the individual sculptures and the decorative scheme were designed to be expressive of the owner's taste and erudition.
With his strong profile, authoritative expression, and dramatic turn of the head, thisbustwas closely modeled on an ancient marble head in the Museo Nazionale, Naples. When it was made in 1758, the bust was mistakenly believed to represent the famous Athenian orator Demosthenes.For those who could not afford to own real antiquities, busts like this one could be ordered from one of many eighteenth-century English sculptors who spent time living in Italy. Such artists established their reputations making replicas of famous antiquities for British aristocrats. Charles Watson-Wentworth, the second marquess of Rockingham, either commissioned this bust directly from the sculptor, Joseph Wilton, or bought it from the sculptor's stock of busts madeall'antica. Along with Joseph Nolleken's statues ofVenus,Minerva, andJuno, the bust was incorporated into aNeoclassicaldecorative scheme, perhaps first in the marquess's London townhouse and then later in his country house in Wentworth. Both the individual sculptures and the decorative scheme were designed to be expressive of the owner's taste andclassicalerudition.
I don't know if all the women in the photographs are beautiful, but I do know that the women are beautiful in the photographs.-Garry Winogrand inWomen are BeautifulSix attractive young women in short dresses sit sandwiched between two men on a bench. One looks upset as she leans against her friend; the others seem distracted. They are engaged in stereotypical girlish behavior: chatting, gossiping, and flirting. Their juxtapositions invite comparisons; their cross-legged postures and dramatic hand gestures echo one another, yet are unique to each of them.As the women's rights movement gained momentum in the 1960s, Garry Winogrand avidly photographed women for his 1975 book,Women are Beautiful. In the preface to a monograph published after the photographer's death, Museum of Modern Art curator John Szarkowski commented:  Winogrand's view of women was perhaps outrageous, or was perhaps saved from outrageousness by its simplicity and openness, and by its reckless enthusiasm. 
Los Angeles International Airport's space-age tower looms over two women stepping onto a curb as they head toward it. For years, Winogrand visited L.A., where he eventually settled. He was drawn to public places where he could find large numbers of people and photograph their interactions.This image combines two of Garry Winogrand's favorite subjects, airports and women-and alludes to a third-animals. Winogrand often made comparisons in his photographs between animals and people, as he does here. The woman on the right in an animal-print dress seems appropriately headed toward a cluster of palm trees.This image is not as complex as many of Winogrand's pictures, which are so filled with visual elements that they often border on chaos. Still, the elements here are layered-the women in the foreground, the trees in the center, and the tower in the background-adding up to a well-balanced photograph.
This image looks spontaneously made, but is in fact carefully composed. A railing juts into the picture's center, leading to a man standing in a balcony corner. He is not looking at the tarmac and runways below him but at his wife and child nearby. The photographer, Garry Winogrand, also captures the mother, teetering in her high heels, as she playfully interacts with her daughter. Winogrand captured the couple's other children, too, as they disregard a  keep off the fence  sign in order to see the plane below.Winogrand apparently disliked air travel, but loved photographing in airports. He lingered there himself to watch how passengers and visitors spent time as they waited for their flights. Although Winogrand sought out certain places, his images are really about the people who, however briefly, inhabit them. This photograph, certainly, may be more of a social observation on family than it is an observation of a specific place, the airport.
Most of Winogrand's best pictures-let us say all of his best pictures-involve luck of a different order than that kind of minimal, survivor's luck on which any human achievement depends.-John Szarkowski inWinogrand: Figments from the Real WorldCall it luck, call it circumstance, but when Garry Winogrand set out to photograph, his colleagues observed that surprising things would happen.Winogrand noticed this odd couple in a parked convertible one night as he wandered Hollywood's Sunset Strip. The man with the bandaged nose glances at his angry-looking female passenger. She seems to be ignoring him. The blurred motion of cars rushing past them underscores how fleeting this moment is.Winogrand's photograph captures Hollywood's unique combination of glamour and seediness. It specifically calls to mind the dark narratives of film noir-the detective movies of the 1940s and '50s that featured tough guys and femmes fatales. The narrative here is ambiguous, prompting questions as to why this man's nose is bandaged and whether the couple is arguing.
Garry Winogrand caught this young woman's graceful gesture and unflinching gaze as he photographed her at a public gathering in Central Park. It looks as if she is performing for the camera, but she may be flying a kite.Winogrand was fully aware that his own gaze was a male one. He liked to trace the origins of his intense interest in photographing women to his teen years, when he worked briefly as a walk-on actor at the ballet. Later, he often found that a certain amount of flirtation was involved when taking pictures of women. Winogrand produced a book of his photographs of anonymous women, including this image, in 1975. He planned to title the book  Confessions of a Male Chauvinist Pig,  but his publisher changed it toWomen are Beautiful.Despite his joking provocations, Winogrand's intentions were serious. He said of the women he observed,  I suspect that I respond to their energies, how they stand and move their bodies and faces. 
I think part of the aim was to unsettle people's ideas, whether his own or other people's. To move people out of an unquestioning space and to some less settled space in which the authority of rules and structures was broken up a bit.-Eileen Hale, Garry Winogrand's widowGarry Winogrand confronted tough issues like racism with a sense of humor, as he did here by photographing this black man and white woman holding apes. The chimpanzees are dressed like children and resemble the human child standing behind the couple. The photographer's close vantage point, the crowd, the dramatic winter light-all add a sense of spectacle.Winogrand was not simply reacting to a strange moment, but probably also to racial tensions sweeping the country at the height of the Civil Rights movement. The year this picture was made, black actors won Academy Awards, and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned state laws banning interracial marriage. It is not clear whether this man and woman were actually a couple, but Winogrand must have known that their togetherness was as unsettling to some people as their circumstances were comical.
A disabled man, bent over in a wheelchair, captures the attention of three women walking by and a boy seated on a bus stop bench. Garry Winogrand's photograph of Hollywood's once-glamorous Walk of Fame depicts strangers reacting to one another in a public space. The image emphasizes an encounter between people of differing social and economic backgrounds and is therefore a highly political social commentary. Elongated crisscrossing shadows falling across the celebrity's stars on the boulevard add a touch of melodrama to the momentary interaction.
The amateur, snapshotlike appearance of Garry Winogrand'sBeverly Hillsphotograph is completely intentional. Winogrand often approached his subjects at a slightly skewed angle, tilting the picture frame in order to create an off-balance sense of reality. As a result his images of people captured unwittingly effectively convey the frenetic energy found along the urban street. In this photograph, a man is divided from a group of women by a street lamp, accentuating fundamental differences between the two sexes. This picture was made while Winogrand was considering a series entitled  Women are Better Than Men. 
The clarity and brilliance of the glass used for this covered goblet imitated the rarer and more costlyrock crystalmaterial used for precious, princely vessels. Deep matte forms, such as the waterfowl and agrotesqueface set amid curling acanthus leaves, are raised up from the surface in sharp contrast to the smoothly polishedbackground. This technique, known asHochschnitt,orrelief cutting, was an important innovation at the end of the 1500s. Glassmakers had developed glass with a harder consistency that could therefore withstand such aggressive carving and polishing.This goblet belongs to a group of similar vessels that all bear the arms of the counts of Schaffgotsch, their mottoAucun temps ne le change(Untouched by time), and their badge of a fir tree. In 1688 Count Christof Leopold Schaffgotsch installed a glass-engraving workshop on his lands to produce richly wrought vessels for his own use. Other goblets produced for him still survive, although most have now lost their domed cover, unlike the Getty Museum's piece.
In this distinctive portrait, Charles Winter posed the sitter in such a way as to suggest a conversation with the viewer. The man's tilted face, defined by knitted brows, makes his countenance especially alert and engaging. The power of the image is in the twisted pose, enhanced by light along the buttons and edge of the coat, that animates his body. The dramaticforeshorteningof the subject makes him appear legless.
In a daring pose reminiscent of harem scenes and odalisques, the Princess Leonilla of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn reclines on a low Turkish sofa on a veranda overlooking a lush tropical landscape. Only her unassailable social position made it possible for Franz Xaver Winterhalter to use such a sensual pose for a full-length portrait in Paris in 1843.Known for her great beauty and intellect, the Princess is resplendent in a luxurious gown of ivory silk moir with a pink sash around her waist. A deep purple mantle wraps around her back and falls across her smooth arms. Under carefully arched eyebrows, her heavy lidded eyes gaze languidly at the viewer while she artfully toys with the large pearls around her neck. Winterhalter contrasted sumptuous fabrics and vivid colors against creamy flesh to heighten the sensuality of the pose, the model, and the luxuriant setting.
A landowner and country gentleman, John Whetham of Kirklington poses beside a border collie in front of a rockybackground. He wears a green coat, a yellow waistcoat, and a fur hat and sash and holds a hunting spear. This costume, unusual for an Englishman, is a loose adaptation of a Hungarian hussar's military dress. Worn by John Whetham for a ball in 1779, this type of masquerade dress was also fashionable for portraits at the time, both because it forwarded the social aspirations of the English aristocracy and because it was timeless, outlasting changing styles.
The potter Josiah Wedgwood commissioned this painting from Joseph Wright of Derby as a tribute to female loyalty and industry. InHomer'sOdyssey,Penelope, awaiting the return of her husbandOdysseusfrom theTrojan War, was beset by suitors who claimed that Odysseus had been shipwrecked. She promised to marry one of them after she completed a shroud for her father-in-law. Steadfastly loyal to her absent husband, Penelope unraveled her weaving at the end of each day to avoid remarrying.Wright presented Penelope late at night, rewinding her thread into a ball. In theforeground, the backlit statue of Odysseus invokes his presence. Moonlight bathes the sleeping figure of their son Telemachus while Penelope looks on. The strong effect of light and dark contributes to the hushed atmosphere and increases the drama of Penelope's plight.
The Dutch Prince Mauritius of Orange lifts up Belgica, a femaleallegoricalfigure symbolizing theFlemishpeople, who turns hopefully toward him. The prince also directs her attention to the barge in thebackground, the  turf ship of Breda.  This barge had secretly carried the prince's troops into Breda's harbor to capture the town from the Spanish in 1590, an important incident from the Eighty Years' War for Dutch independenceA pair of shadowy trees and bushes sharply divides theforegroundfigures from the background harbor scene. Joachim Anthonisz. Wtewael used dark graywashon the foliage as an effective contrast to the brilliant white on the people and the buildings. White hatching creates texture on Belgica's dress and gleams from Prince Mauritius's armor, and whitehighlightsilluminatethe towers and steeples of Breda in the distance.
In theMetamorphoses,the Roman authorOvidtells the story of how the lovers Venus and Mars were surprised byVenus'shusband,Vulcan.  Vulcan, a blacksmith, forged an invisible bronze net, which he secretly attached toMars'sbed.  Here Vulcan stands upon Mars's armor, discarded at the right, whileCupidandApollohover above, drawing back the green canopy to reveal the astonished lovers in an embrace. Other gods and goddesses also gather to witness and mock the adulterous couple. In a scene beyond the bed, Vulcan hammers his net at the forge.Exaggerated poses and brilliant, jewel-like color emphasize the dramatic intensity of the scene. The hard, metallic surface of the copper lends itself to highly finished and detailed pictures.  Because of the erotic subject matter, the painting's early owners may have concealed the painting behind a curtain or in a drawer, which preserved its lustrous appearance.
Despite his small size, this figure ofNeptune, god of the sea, has a powerful and imposing presence. He may have originally been the centerpiece for a fountain. In his right hand he once held atrident, now missing, while in his left he holds a conch shell. The artist, probably Benedikt Wurzelbauer, suggests the nude figure's great strength through the carefully articulated muscles on his chest and the veins on his arms. The figure leans his weight on his back leg, arching his back slightly as if fighting the wind that blows his hair and beard. His upraised arms, the twist of his right wrist, and the position of his feet recall dance poses. The high gloss on the bronze and the slight twist in the torso bring out a shimmering play of light on the metallic surface. In contrast to Italian practice, Germanfoundriesof this period frequently used wood rather thanterracottaor wax models. The rigid treatment of this figure's details, together with its stiff pose and the planar handling of its surfaces, suggests that it was cast from a carved wood model.
Francesco Xanto Avelli painted the entire surface of this large plate with a scene of the abduction ofHelenby the Trojans. It shows the moment when Helen, the beautiful daughter ofZeus, is being forced into a boat by the Trojans. Her kidnapping caused a war between the Greeks and the men ofTroy.Xanto copied the scene from a popular engraving of Helen's abduction. Beginning in the mid-1400s, prints and engravings were widely available and were frequently adapted by artists to fit the circular shapes of ceramics. Xanto probably transferred the image by pricking the print with small holes, placing thecartoonagainst the ceramic surface, and then rubbing a dark powder on it, which would copy the lines of the image onto the plate when it passed through the holes.The back of the plate is inscribed in blue with the date, the artist's signature, and a verse describing the mythological scene on the front.
In an elaborately detailed Gothic cathedral, Pope Gregory the Great kneels before the crucified Christ, who has miraculously appeared before the congregation. While saying mass one day, Pope Gregory became aware of a disbeliever and began to pray for a sign that would leave no doubt about the real presence of Christ in the Mass. Showing his stigmata and surrounded by instruments of his Passion, Christ materialized before the Pope. Gregory sees the vision first, gazing intently above as he spreads his hands in amazement.Adriaen Ysenbrandt used gold-colored paint liberally to describe decorative candlesticks, censers, goblets, and the fine liturgical vestments. The church's ornate interior was rendered in crisp detail. In contrast, the figure's faces were softly and loosely painted, giving their features a blurred effect.
This sculpture representing a ram's skull and horn is at once realistic and abstract. Composed of two parts, one form twists and curves upward, suggesting the distinct, massive horn of a ram. The second, more compact form evokes the long-faced shape of the skull. Its indentations suggest the hollow space of the eye sockets and mouth. But each part also clearly departs from a naturalistic depiction. In fact, it is not the forms themselves but their varied surfaces--furrowed and grained or smooth and polished--that most acutely conjure up a craggy, decaying skeleton. It is as if we have stumbled upon some slightly unfamiliar archeological find.Jack Zajac's inspiration to sculpt a ram's skull came from casually squeezing balls of wax into shapes he found appealing. According to the artist, he noticed a striking resemblance to an animal's skull in the wax's contours. Zajac then elaborated this form into a more immediately recognizable image. TheRam's Skullseries is comprised of fourteen unique sculptures. Several of the sculptures, like this one, are made up of two discrete parts. The decision to separate the skull and horn arose when a plaster Zajac was working on broke in two and he appreciated the effect of this  accident. Zajac builds his plaster models by hand and carves directly into the surface using hand-axes and chisels. The bronze is then cast from the plaster. Here, the metal's rough-hewn surface accurately reflects the rugged contours of the plaster's exterior.
A life-drawing class is about to begin at Bologna's Accademia Clementina. At the center, the master directs the model's pose while the students talk animatedly. A background niche holds a plaster model or drawing of the ancient Roman sculpture, theFarnese Hercules.The master's features, particularly his large nose, suggest that Zanotti may have portrayed himself here.To continue the Bolognese painting tradition established by the Carracci, particularly its emphasis on life drawing from the nude, Zanotti helped to found the Accademia Clementina in 1710. Life drawing was the basis of instruction at the Accademia, so the subject was appropriate for this drawing, the basis for an engravedfrontispieceto Zanotti'sStoria dell'Accademia Clementina di Bolognaof 1739.Zanotti began by sketching with black chalk, then went over those lines with pen and ink. His thought process is evident in the chalk underdrawing of the lamp and its rope, which he initially drew farther to the left. Zanotti, who probably also made the engraving, went over the principal outlines with the stylus to transfer the design to the copperplate for engraving.
Arms crossed in veneration, a youthfulVirgin Marybows her head and looks solemnly at her infant son. He in turn looks out and makes the sign of benediction toward her. In a strikingly human gesture, an angel gently holds the shoulder and side of the unsteady child, ensuring that he does not topple forward. Angels on either side of the scene play musical instruments; a trio of angels above kneel on a cloud and sing in accompaniment. The scene takes place under a vaulted ceiling supported bypilasterswithCorinthiancapitals. Bernardino Zenale's modeling of the figures and his depiction of a misty landscape derived from Leonardo da Vinci's style.This painting was originally the central panel of analtarpiecein the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in San Francesco, Cant, Italy. The two side panels depicting various saints are now in museums in Milan.
John Peyto, fourteenth Lord Willoughby de Broke, and his wife, Lady Louisa North, appear about to take tea with their three young children. She holds her daughter, who stands on the table attempting a first step. In high spirits, one son enters on the right pulling a bright red toy horse. Another son attempts to take a piece of buttered bread from the table while receiving an admonishing gesture from his father. Johann Zoffany, with his ability to portray lively figures interacting together in meticulous detailed settings, excelled at conversation pieces. These informal group portraits, introduced as a newgenreof painting in England in the 1700s, vividly recorded the settings and social customs of the time.Zoffany took care to include the details of the gentry's lives: Lady Louisa's shimmering light blue gown, the landscape painting above the fireplace mantel, the fineporcelaintea service, and the reflections on the highly polished silver urn. The sparse room also makes a statement about the family's social position. Only an ancient, titled family of the British ruling class would adopt the deliberate casualness of the olive-drab walls and worn carpet. The family has nonetheless displayed its wealth in their fashionable costumes.
Accompanied by the young satyrs and nymphs with whom he grew up, the young godBacchusrides in on a goat, probably alluding to his origins as a fertility god worshipped as a bull or a goat. Bacchus's plump, old teacher Silenos looks on from the hill while mature nymphs and a satyr dance in the background. Despite Bacchus's identity as the god of wine, no one drinks wine in this picture.The loosely interpreted subject matter, however, merely serves as a pretext for the idyllicItalianatelandscape with its cloudless sky, lush trees, and warm sunlight. Francesco Zuccarelli's characteristically lighthearted, decorative enchantments satisfied his patrons' desire for an ideal country scene on the walls of their own homes.Zuccarelli frequently included gourd bottles in his paintings as a pun on his own name: the wordzuccois Italian for gourd. In this painting, a gourd bottle hangs in the small tree behind Silenos.
A large tree on the right leads the viewer's eye into this idyllic Italian landscape. The pastoral scenery is divided in half by the swiftly flowing river, which branches from a waterfall behind the grand tree. Along the banks of the river, a shepherd and two shepherdesses rest peacefully with their cattle and sheep under the shade of the tree, while several fishermen relax in the sunshine. Classical ruins flank the modern building along the distant rolling hills.Foreign tourists traveling through Italy in the 1700s delighted in Zuccarelli's tranquil scenes, purchasing landscapes such as this to remind them of their beautiful tours. This particular sheet once belonged to the French engraver Pierre-Franois Basan, who admired it so much that he engraved and published it.
Carrying the model of a city on their shoulders, a group of Roman soldiers marches triumphantly through the streets. A small boy runs beside them, looking up at the ornate construction. The frieze-like arrangement to the figures, their sculptural character indicated by extensive white heightening, and the vantage point from below indicate that this was a design for a facade painting. Although Taddeo Zuccaro was famous for them during his early career, most of his work in this medium has now been lost. This drawing may relate to his best known faade painting and first independent project in the Palazzo Mattei in Rome, completed in 1548. In this masterful drawing Zuccaro used the blue paper that artists in Venice so often favored. The blue served as a middle tone, with the outlines and shadows drawn in black chalk and the shining highlights of flesh, armor, and drapery added in white. The three tones combine to fully model the three-dimensional figures.
Taddeo Zuccaro's design for a metal circular dish or salver assured that dining would be a surprising and humorous experience. The sea monsters along the border fight and embrace each other. A large bearded head, possibly Neptune, gazes up from the bottom of the bowl as if from the ocean's depths, only making himself known as the vessel's contents are emptied. Here Zuccaro explored the problem of accommodating active figures within a circular frame. The reclining female figure at the top shares certain features with the sibyl on the verso. In exploring his ideas, Zuccaro flipped the paper over, proceeding naturally from one project to the other. Whether completely spontaneous or more finished, energy and expressiveness characterize his line.The studies on the verso are connected with decorations that Zuccaro completed in a Roman chapel in 1556. Despite their sketchy appearance, he probably drew them at a late stage in the design process because they correspond closely to figures in the fresco. The female figures served as studies for a sibyl in the round lunette above the altar.
Taddeo Zuccaro captured the dramatic moment when a sudden light from heaven blinded Saint Paul. The saint lies prostrate on the ground while one servant tends to him and another flees the scene in terror, shielding his eyes from the piercing light as he runs. His horse, too, has fallen down and clambers awkwardly to its feet. Paul had been on the road to Damascus to obtain authorization from the synagogue to arrest Christians when he was suddenly struck by the brilliant light and converted to Christianity. The artist sketched the figures first with black chalk, then went over their outline in brown ink. Fine strokes of lead white heightening create the textures of muscles and fabrics while providing a delicate contrast to the blue tone of the paper. Zuccaro drew this preparatory study for the lower section of a now much-damaged altarpiece in a chapel in Rome. He worked in the chapel from around 1557 until his death nine years later, painting frescoes from the life of Saint Paul.
A group of men in armor, wearing plumed helmets and carrying swords, faces civilians dressed in the robes of scholars, or men of the church. One soldier presents something in his outstretched hand to the foremost man on the right, who holds a book or documents in his left hand. Someone squared the drawing in red chalk to make it easier to transfer the scene to another surface.When Taddeo Zuccaro died in 1566, he was still working on the decorations for the room of Farnese history in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. He made this drawing as a preparatory sketch for a small scene set above one of the windows in the room. Scholars know that it represents an incident from the history of the Farnese family because the small boy on the left holds a shield decorated with lilies, the symbol of the Farnese. Although the exact significance of the gathering is uncertain, it may represent Cardinal Albornoz handing over the keys to the fortress of Valentano to the Farnese in 1534.
A crowd of Venetians gathers to observe the dramatic submission of the German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Pope Alexander III. Soldiers and clerics mingle with children and dogs. Federico Zuccaro filled the scene with small details, noting everything from the delicate carving in the arches of the cathedral to the boats in the harbor and the men peering around the columns to better view the scene below.Zuccaro made this drawing in preparation for a painting for the Palazzo Ducale, Venice, which was to replace Tintoretto's version destroyed by fire. Zuccaro drew an event that took place in 1177, more than four hundred years earlier. Emperor Frederick I, nicknamed  Barbarossa  or  Red Beard  by the Italians, had tried to invade Italy and set up his own pope, which led Pope Alexander to excommunicate him. Frederick withdrew temporarily but then returned, captured Rome, and was in the midst of preparing further attacks when his army was destroyed by disease. After his defeat, he agreed to recognize Alexander and was triumphantly accepted back into the Catholic Church.
In this series of twenty drawings, Federico Zuccaro illustrated the early life of his older brother Taddeo Zuccaro, from the hardships of his early training in Rome until his first artistic triumph at the age of eighteen. In addition to the sixteen scenes from Taddeo's life, the series includes four drawings of allegorical Virtues flanking the Zuccaro emblem. The drawings vividly convey a sense of the artist's material and intellectual life in Renaissance Rome. Details of studio practice join depictions of precise locations, monuments, and antiquities and references to the great artistic personalities of the Renaissance, including Michelangelo and Raphael. Scholars believe that the shape of the drawings shows that they were studies for decorative ceiling panels. Because so many of the sheets contain images of Rome, they may have been intended for frescoes in the Palazzo Zuccari in Rome. In Federico's will of 1603, he left his palazzo to the Accademia di San Luca so that it could be used as a hostel for poor, young artists coming to study in the capital. The imagery of Taddeo's early struggles would have been an appropriate reminder for the students at the beginning of their careers.
Allegorical figures of Faith and Hope sit on either side of a sugar loaf stuck with lilies, the Zuccaro family emblem, which plays on the Italian word for sugar,zucchero. Dressed in a long, hooded cloak gathered at her throat, Faith holds a cross in one hand and gestures with the other while a small dog paws her knee. Hope lifts her eyes to heaven, her hands joined in prayer. The light seems to come from the upper left, highlighting one side of the women's faces while casting the other side of their bodies into dark shadow.The drawing's irregular shape and viewpoint suggest that it was intended for a ceiling decoration
Against his father's wishes, the fourteen-year-old Taddeo Zuccaro leaves his hometown to study painting in Rome, accompanied by two guardian angels--or possibly the figures of Hope and Charity. Federico Zuccaro included himself in the scene, aged two or three and clinging behind his mother's skirts. Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author and painter, mentioned this event in hisLives of Painters, Sculptors and Architects, noting that Taddeo  went off alone, at the age of fourteen, to Rome.  In his own copy of Vasari's book, Federico elaborated on Vasari's account:  when Taddeo grew older and able to judge things for himself, realizing that there was little more that he could learn from his father . . . and that he was still not experienced enough to be of any help to him, at the age of fourteen he went by himself to Rome. 
Dressed in her armor, plumed helmet, and shield, Minerva, goddess of learning and the arts, welcomes Taddeo Zuccaro to Rome; he in turn marvels at the city laid out before him. Federico Zuccaro set the scene on the road to the north of the city with one of the city gates just down the road. The church of Santa Maria del Popolo, the Pantheon, and the Coliseum are all visible in the distance. Federico drew his brother in typical peasant costume, wearing stockings probably made from wool or linen cloth and cut to the shape of the leg. A short-sleeved tunic labeled with his name along the bottom covers his body, and he carries his belongings rolled in a cloth on his back.
Carrying the yoke, symbol of servitude or obedience in his arms, Taddeo Zuccaro enters Rome through one of the city's gates. The tall, gaunt figure of Servitude welcomes him, and Hardship and Toil peer over her shoulders at the young boy, predicting the hardships he will encounter in the city. Federico Zuccaro labeled each figure so that there would be no mistaking their identity. The ox and ass, representing Fortitude and Patience graze off to the side. Federico placed many of these scenes from his brother's life in exact locations that are easily identifiable. The tower of Old Saint Peter's and Michelangelo's new domed Saint Peter's basilica under construction are visible beyond the city wall. The hoists, ropes, and supports used to build the dome project from the top. The obelisk to the left of the tower was moved from that location to Saint Peter's Square in the 1590s.
In a continuous narrative that moves from right to left, Taddeo Zuccaro brings a letter of introduction to his cousin, the painter Francesco il Sant'Angelo, who worked in the studio of painter Perino del Vaga. Brusquely dismissed by his relation, Taddeo leaves in tears but soon catches sight of a large frescoed facade by one of the most admired painters of the day, Polidoro da Caravaggio. At the back of the drawing, the small figure of Taddeo crouches down in the middle of the piazza to sketch the facade. The building that he sketches has now been destroyed, but scholars have identified the palazzo.Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author and painter, included this story in hisLives of Painters, Sculptors and Architects, noting that:  In Rome he had a hard time at first, being friendless and lonely. The one person he did know treated him more unkindly than anyone else, for when he humbly approached Francesco il Sant'Angelo, a journeyman artist employed by Perino del Vaga for grotesque decoration, who was a relation, Francesco, behaving as relations often do, gave him neither practical help nor even advice, but turned him harshly away. 
Allegorical figures of Fortitude and Patience sit on either side of a large, empty circle that Federico probably intended to contain a device, such as the sugar loaf belonging to the Zuccaro family. Fortitude, one of the four cardinal virtues, sits on the left, symbolizing courage, strength, and endurance. A lion signifying bravery crouches at her feet, while an ox peers over her shoulder. On the right, Patience carries the yoke of servitude or obedience and sits with a lamb at her feet. An ass stands behind her.The drawing's irregular shape and viewpoint suggest to scholars that it was intended for a ceiling decoration. The light seems to come from the upper left, highlighting one side of the women's faces while casting the other side of their bodies into dark shadow.
Federico Zuccaro vividly conveyed a sense of the studio assistant's material and psychological life in Renaissance Rome in this beautiful nocturnal scene. At the back of the room, the light of the fire shows the young Taddeo Zuccaro grinding colors while his employer's wife looks over her shoulder to check what he is doing. It is a cold evening, and she has removed her shoe to warm her foot before the open grate. A cat hovers near the fire too, curled up on the ledge above the woman's head. In order to prevent Taddeo from having bread, his employer the minor painter Calabrese kept it in a basket attached to the ceiling in the center of the room. He attached a bell to the pulley and rope so that it would ring every time the basket was lowered.Taddeo appears again at the front of the room, leaning against a low wall and holding an oil lamp so his master can examine a drawing. Calabrese glances up at his apprentice to make sure that he is not looking at the work by the revered artist Raphael, which he refused to allow Taddeo to copy. The inscription by Taddeo's pained face translates as,  Why do you deny me that which I love  
Sent on an errand by the wife of the artist Calabrese, to whom he was apprenticed, Taddeo Zuccaro stops to admire a painted facade by Polidoro da Caravaggio, one of the most popular painters of his day. As in other episodes in this series, Federico Zuccaro set this incident in a recognizable setting. The Pantheon and probably the old church of the Trinit dei Monti are just visible in the distance. In the foreground, Taddeo grinds colors for his master but pauses to draw one of the figures he has just seen with a twig in the colored powder.Federico captured the joys and hardships of the life of a young artist, as well as giving a heartfelt tribute to his revered and gifted elder brother. This scene, as well as others in the series, provides a sense of the topographical and physical appearance of Renaissance Rome, with its newly decorated palaces mixed with its marvels of antiquity.
Federico Zuccaro noted that,  When [his brother Taddeo] was living in the house of Calabrese he could never make drawings in the daytime and hardly ever in the evenings, and at night he had to go to bed in the dark because he was grudged even a drop of oil for a lamp; but his desire was so great that he would get up and draw by moonlight on the windows.  Here Taddeo Zuccaro has leapt out of bed half-dressed in order to frantically sketch the Tiber river, Castel Sant'Angelo, and the dome of Saint Peter's basilica under construction by moonlight. He has only had time to put on one slipper, while the rest of his clothing lies haphazardly beside the bed in the corner. Federico  added many small details of everyday life: the chamber pot under the bed, the jagged board Taddeo used to support his paper, and the shutters on whose makeshift surfaces he has drawn figures. These all create a vivid impression of a young artist's material life in Renaissance Rome.
Here Taddeo Zuccaro performs the numerous menial tasks his master's wife ordered him to do. Under the watchful eye of his mistress, he makes the Calabreses' bed, which is raised on a low platform on the left. He brings wood from the cellar, balancing a jug on his head, and crouches on the floor to start the fire for cooking. In the background, Federico Zuccaro enlarged the window so that he could show the view of the Castel Sant'Angelo, with the bridge and the old and new Saint Peter's basilica in the distance. In Florence or Venice, Taddeo would have found a place in a well-organized studio of some established artist. But in Rome, where more haphazard conditions existed, he drifted from one minor painter to another, supporting himself by doing odd jobs about their studios and working as a servant in their homes.
Allegorical figures of Wisdom and Diligence stand on either side of an empty circle that Federico probably intended to contain an emblem, such as the sugar loaf belonging to the Zuccaro family. On the left, the small cherub representing Wisdom holds a shield and spear. A head, perhaps that of the goddess Minerva, decorates the shield. Another cupid on the right, signifying Diligence, holds a spade from which sprouts a bunch of grain and a shield decorated with a spider web.
Giorgio Vasari the Renaissance author and painter mentioned that Taddeo Zuccaro  resolved to live by himself and to have recourse to the workshops of Rome where he was by that time known, spending a part of the week doing work for a livelihood, and the rest in drawing.  Like every young artist of his day, Taddeo educated himself by learning to copy antique sculptures. In the foreground he busily copies a classical Roman torso set on a carved pedestal. In the background he sits in front of a lavishly decorated palace facade, probably painted by Polidoro da Caravaggio, showing his drawing to another man.
The biographer and painter Giorgio Vasari noted that Taddeo Zuccaro drew  particularly the works by the hand of Raphael that were in the house of Agostino Chigi [the Villa Farnesina] and in other places in Rome. And since very often, when the evening came on, he had no other place wherein to sleep, many a night he took refuge under the loggia of the above-named Chigi's house and in other suchlike places.  Under the light of a crescent moon, Taddeo carefully copies Raphael's frescoes in the arches of the loggia above. Like other young artists of his day, he was eager to educate himself by copying the modern masters. Federico Zuccaro so carefully reproduced these designs that scholars can identify the scenes asJupiter and CupidandPsyche Reaching the Palace of Venus.At left, Taddeo lies exhausted, having fallen asleep while drawing.
Federico Zuccaro described this scene in his notes:  One should not keep quiet to what happened to [Taddeo Zuccaro] during his return: tired of walking and suffering from fever, he stopped on the banks of a river, and waiting for someone to take him across, he rested and fell asleep; he woke up all sick from the pain he had and looking at the bank of the river, the stone and the gravel seemed as painted and historiated, similar to the facade and works of Polidoro [da Caravaggio] that he saw in Rome; this pleased him greatly. So shaken was his mind, and with the imagination he had, he really believed these to be what they seemed to be. He began his search for the stones that seemed better and more beautiful; he filled a sack, in which he carried his small things and his drawings.  In a continuous narrative, Federico represented his brother four times. Taddeo falls asleep by a stream on the left and dreams in a circle above his head. In his illness he awakens to a hallucination that the river stones are painted with figures by Polidoro. He then loads his sack with these precious objects and struggles onwards.
This story in three scenes moves from right to left. First Taddeo Zuccaro returns home, slack-mouthed with exhaustion, carrying the heavy sack of stones he gathered on his back. As biographer Giorgio Vasari explained, Taddeo  carried them home and gave them to his mother, telling her they were even more precious than himself.  In the center, Taddeo's parents welcome the young man warmly as he deliriously points to his heavy bag. On the left, he lies in bed, watched over by his parents and his little brother, the artist Federico Zuccaro. A large carved wooden bed with a canopy nearly fills the room. Several paintings and a frescoed  cornice on the far wall and a fireplace projecting from the hidden wall form the other handsome furnishings.
 Taddeo [Zuccaro], at length, restored to health and once more in Rome, resumed his usual studies,  noted his contemporary, biographer and artist Giorgio Vasari. Here the young artist enters Rome through one of the city's gates. He stands on the threshold of the gate, holding the hands of figures representing Drawing and Spirit. The Three Graces stand nearby, waiting for them to enter.As in other drawings from this series, Federico Zuccaro included a detailed and accurate view of Rome from the city gate. The steps of the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo are just visible between Taddeo's legs, and the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, the Colonna Antonini, and the Campidoglio fill the background.
Having recovered from his illness, Taddeo Zuccaro returned to Rome to study both classical and contemporary works of art. He sits in the courtyard of the Vatican Belvedere, sketching theLaocon. Around him are theApollo Belvedereand the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile. An inkwell and pen box sit at his feet as he draws.The highlights of Roman architecture stretch out below Taddeo, including the papal apartments of the Vatican decorated by Raphael. Federico Zuccaro singled them out for notice with his label,le camere di Rafaello(Raphael's apartments). On the right is the new Saint Peter's basilica under construction. The left side of the courtyard was still open in the 1540s, but it was closed in later in the century.
Standing at the steps of the pope's throne in the Sistine Chapel, Taddeo Zuccaro sketches one of Michelangelo's masterpieces, theLast Judgement. At his feet Federico Zuccaro added his brother's inkwell, a pen box, and a bag. Taddeo appears older than in previous scenes, no longer a boy but a young man with leggings to his knees, a long-sleeved jacket, and a loose cap over his curls.
The series culminates with the largest and most elaborate scene, showing Taddeo Zuccaro decorating the facade of the Palazzo Mattei, the work that established his reputation when he was only eighteen years old. Biographer Giorgio Vasari explained that when Taddeo returned to Rome, his cousin Francesco il Sant'Angelo sought him out and they began to work together on many commissions. Francesco recommended him to a Roman nobleman, Jacopo Mattei, and suggested that Taddeo paint the first two subjects to prove his artistic talent when Mattei thought the artist too young. Taddeo sits precariously on a scaffolding painting the facade, with two allegories of Fame flying above. The Three Graces stand around him with Allegories of Spirit and Pride. Although the frescoes are still unfinished in the drawing, the most famous painters in Rome already flock to see them. Michelangelo arrives on horseback with his servant and two of his followers, and Vasari is deep in conversation with Francesco Salviati on the far right. Completed in 1548, the facade was hailed as a masterpiece by the leading artists in Rome, and it cemented the young Taddeo's reputation.
Allegorical figures of Study and Intelligence sit on either side of the Zuccaro family's symbol of a sugar loaf sprouting lilies, a play on the Italian wordzucchero,meaning sugar. The figure of Study is hard at work drawing a nude torso, surrounded by a rooster and various other sculptures. Intelligence, on the right, holds a caduceus in his right hand, while an elephant peers out beside him.The drawing's irregular shape and viewpoint suggest to scholars that it was intended for a ceiling decoration.
In the center of the canvas,Cupid, the god of love, subdues the godPanby grabbing one of his ears. Pan personifies carnal lust, so their struggle represents the combat of divine and earthly love. The subject comes from a popular quotation from the Roman poetVirgil:  Love conquers all.  The scene is set inArcadia, a romantic paradise inhabited bynymphsand shepherds. Around Cupid and Pan, various figures gesture as they watch the two gods struggle. A wingedallegoricalfigure soars above, catching the attention of several figures below.This scene may derive from the central vault of the Sala d'Ercole (Room ofHercules) in the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, which was painted by Federico Zuccaro.
Using red chalk in a highly detailed manner, Federico Zuccaro depicted Saint Peter's Square in Rome as it appeared in 1603, with the Egyptian obelisk in place at the extreme left and the church dome complete. At the left, the archepiscopal palace adjoins the old facade of Saint Peter's basilica. In the center, the three-story benediction loggia begun by Pope Pius II in 1462 adjoins the loggia painted by Raphael, lightly sketched at the extreme right. The bastion for the papal guard protects the front of the Vatican entrance, and statues of saints Peter and Paul from the 1400s adorn the foot of the staircase.On the verso, Zuccaro drew a young boy with great intimacy, using the same medium--black and red chalk--and the same delicacy of touch seen in his other late portrait studies. Zuccaro's use of color was innovative: scholars recognize him as the first Italian of his time to combine black with red chalk, a technique practiced earlier by Hans Holbein.
Humans and animals co-exist peacefully in this lush, fantastical setting. In the foreground, graceful nude figures lounge or pose elegantly like statues, while two small boys urinate into a stream that flows into a small pool. In the background, figures dance in a circle; high above in the distance, others sit on a hill and watch wild animals at play.Jacopo Zucchi made this highly finished compositional study, or modello, for the small scale paintingThe Age of Gold, now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. The Golden Age, the first of four ages of the world in classical mythology, followed immediately after the world's creation and was an earthly paradise akin to the Christian Garden of Eden.
